1196258230;Mirror for Chromecast;"Application to mirror the screen and audio of your Mac to a Chromecast 1, 2 or Ultra. You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your TV. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your TV!

When using this app with a Chromecast 1, the Screen Mirroring will start about 30 seconds after you start mirroring, please wait during this startup time. Chromecast 2 and Ultra are much faster to start.

In using the app, there will be a about 2 to 3 seconds of latency (lag). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

1. Restart your router. Just take out the power plug, wait 10 seconds and put it back in. This resets your router and will make your home network faster and more stable. Why this works? Routers are in essence little computers, with software. Software will have small memory leaks and some processes will stop working correctly over time. That’s why it is a good idea to reset your router once in a while. Our recommendation: once a week. 

2. Don’t do network intense work while screen mirroring. As explained, screen mirroring is network intense. For the best performance, don’t do other network intense work at the same time. This includes making timemachine backups over the network and uploading/downloading large files from the internet while screen mirroring.

3. Put your Mac and your Chromecast on the same router channel. Some routers (dual band) have create both a 2.4Ghz and a 5Ghz wireless network. For the best performance, put your Mac and your TV on the same network. Preferably the 5Ghz network. But definitely not the Mac on 5Ghz and the TV on 2.4Ghz, because that will negatively impact the performance of screen mirroring.

4. Use an AC or N router. Newer routers support Wifi AC and N. Older routers might only have Wifi B and/or G. B and G are not really up to scratch anymore for modern networking tasks, so go for an AC or N router. If your router supports AC and N, also make sure that your router is set to use either the Wifi N or Wifi AC networking. 

How the app works:
First, make sure that your Chromecast is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your Chromecast on the network. It will show your Chromecast when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

Settings (the icon in the bottom right of the app): click here to request support from our 24/7 support staff. They usually respond within 2 hours on any query that you might have. If your question is technical, please also include the diagnostics information.

Limitations: Apple has HDCP DRM protection for playing iTunes movies. This means that screen mirroring is not possible when watching movies from iTunes.

When you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!

1227495720;Girl2Girl Wall;"From the creators of Miss O and Friends, the Girl2 Girl Wall App is the safest social network app for girls ages 8-15, where you can ask questions, get advice, give advice and talk about anything & everything. The Wall is a perfect place for tweens to make friends and be supportive and helpful to one another. All content moderated by humans prior to posting. All content by girls, for girls! 

No bullying, no identifiable info, all posts are screened by real people before to ensure safety. 100% COPPA compliant. 

Sign in with your existing Miss O and Friends username or create a new account. *Make sure to use a valid email address so you can confirm your account!* 

You start by entering a ""Convo"" or a ""Chat.""

A ""convo"" is basically a new thread, topic or question. A ""chat"" is basically a reply or answer. 

When you join a group, convos in that group will show up on your feed. You can join as many groups as you want! 

View a group and check out its feed to see what other girls are talking about. You can scroll through the group to see all the latest convos. 

Follow any convos that you are interested in and they will show up in your feed. 

Share/text convos & chats with friends (off the app) who might find it helpful, funny or cool! 

To make sure this stays a no-bullying place, convos and chats are moderated before they are posted on the app. If your convo is not posted, it's most likely because it was: mean, had bad language, indefinable info or inappropriate for the audience. You'll get notifications when anyone chats to your convo. We try our best to approve them as fast as possible! 

Great way to get quick advice, helpful tips (Like what to wear to a school dance! Or birthday gift ideas! Or how to respond when the boy you like sends you a wink emoji). 

It's all about girls helping girls- offering their opinions, suggestions and ideas! Totally by girls, for girls. 

You can also connect with other girls who are passionate about world issues, animals, the environment, writing, sports, school, gaming, entrepreneurship and more. 

Remember, it's anonymous (only username, first name, age and US State/ Country) so you really can feel free to ask those awkward/ embarrassing questions, vent about feeling left out, or gush about your latest crush. 

Make friends with girls from all over the world! 

And we promise- NO bullying, NO online creeps, it's 100% safe and secure. But still be mindful of what you post. If it's mean, threatening, hateful, has any identifiable info, it will not be posted.

We are not a therapy service, this is just girls helping other girls, talking about things and having fun. If you are having serious issues such as depression, thoughts of self-harm or suicide, sexual abuse, please seek professional help. Going to a guidance counselor at school, a teacher or adult you trust is a really great start. And remember, your life is worth living and there are people who care. 

This app is geared for girls ages 7-15 so be mindful what you are posting. If it is inappropriate for this age group, it will not be posted. If you are older, definitely feel free to offer younger girls advice from your own experiences. It's a great place to be a mentor and empower other girls.

1196261387;Mirror for Roku;"Application to mirror the screen and audio of your Mac to a Roku Streaming Player, Roku Streaming Stick or Roku TV (from Hisense, TCL, Insignia and Sharp).

You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your Roku. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your Roku!

In using the app, there will be a about 2 to 3 seconds of latency (lag). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

1. Restart your router. Just take out the power plug, wait 10 seconds and put it back in. This resets your router and will make your home network faster and more stable. Why this works? Routers are in essence little computers, with software. Software will have small memory leaks and some processes will stop working correctly over time. That’s why it is a good idea to reset your router once in a while. Our recommendation: once a week. 

2. Don’t do network intense work while screen mirroring. As explained, screen mirroring is network intense. For the best performance, don’t do other network intense work at the same time. This includes making timemachine backups over the network and uploading/downloading large files from the internet while screen mirroring.

3. Put your Mac and your Roku on the same router channel. Some routers (dual band) have create both a 2.4Ghz and a 5Ghz wireless network. For the best performance, put your Mac and your TV on the same network. Preferably the 5Ghz network. But definitely not the Mac on 5Ghz and the TV on 2.4Ghz, because that will negatively impact the performance of screen mirroring.

4. Use an AC or N router. Newer routers support Wifi AC and N. Older routers might only have Wifi B and/or G. B and G are not really up to scratch anymore for modern networking tasks, so go for an AC or N router. If your router supports AC and N, also make sure that your router is set to use either the Wifi N or Wifi AC networking. 

How the app works:
First, make sure that your Roku is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your Roku on the network. It will show your Roku when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

Settings (the icon in the bottom right of the app): click here to request support from our 24/7 support staff. They usually respond within 2 hours on any query that you might have. If your question is technical, please also include the diagnostics information.

Limitations: Apple has HDCP DRM protection for playing iTunes movies. This means that screen mirroring is not possible when watching movies from iTunes.

When you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!

1475696633;Super Arcade Racing;"Super Arcade Racing is a retro-inspired, super-fun racing game that gives you the pure experience of real arcade gameplay. Simple controls and tons of fun with a classic 2D top-down view, amazing pixel art and an iconic soundtrack, combined with an intriguing story and more than 80 levels to play.

Prepare to enter the world of underground car racing, in the hopes to save your brother. It’s going to be dangerous, but taking part in the clandestine Super Arcade Racing will be your only chance to see your little bro again and solve the mystery behind the organization that kidnapped him.

You’ll have a car to upgrade and personalise after every race, with new parts to go faster, have more grip and better control. You will meet dark rivals and deceiving enemies. Defeat them and clear your path to the final victory. Along the way, you might discover something more about yourself.

SINGLE PLAYER
In the full game, the single player mode has 60 levels to go through, with a storyline running alongside and tough bosses to defeat. And in keeping with the arcade spirit, try and discover the secret levels off the map!

GARAGE
Visit the garage to upgrade or modify your car. Your trusted uncle will help you out with the amendments both cosmetic and perform-enhancing.

CUSTOMISABLE: Infinite car variations!
You have 1 car to run with and it will be your most precious ally. Make it better and make it unique. Earn money for every race and spend your cash on new exhausts, tighter brakes, better tyres and even a more powerful engine. You’ll gain better control of your car, more speed and your chances to win will spike.
You can also choose the colours of your car and change body parts for a full personalisation.

TRAINING MODE
Get to know the tracks before challenging your opponents to be faster and better, cut corners and equip your car at the best for that setting. The more you play, the better you will know your car: how it reacts to certain tracks and conditions, how it handles acceleration and drifting.
You’ll see your previous performance in the form of a ghost car during the race, to give you a reference and help you getting better.

LOCATIONS
Drive on city roads, across the desert and in forests; different modes (circuit, challenge and pursuit to name some), obstacles and a few hidden tracks off the maps. You’ll have to race in the snow, in the rain and many more.

FUN ELEMENTS
Mind that cone and avoid the oil on the road. Jump on ramps and discover shortcuts and secret passages.

INTRIGUING, SURPRISING STORY
Expect the unexpected. Race after race you’ll know a bit more about the underground world of Super Arcade Racing, the dark organisation running it and who (or what) is behind Martin’s kidnapping.

REAL ARCADE
You won’t need special skills to drive, but you will get better the more you play. Simple tracks and circuits and only 2 buttons to accelerate and brake, offering the pure fun of real arcade gameplay.

ORIGINAL PIXEL ART
Super Arcade Racing will bring back the magic of the 16-bit pixel graphic we fell in love with in the late 80s. Beautiful pixel-drawn illustrations and animations will give you that nostalgic feeling of playing a classic.

ICONIC SOUNDTRACK
Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of those most-loved car race movies, TV series and video games from the 80s and 90s with an inspired soundtrack originally composed for Super Arcade Racing, played back on a custom midi-tracker system.

LEADERBOARDS
Every level has its own leaderboard and every leaderboard has its champion. Will you be the fastest?

ONLINE MULTIPLAYER
10 levels exclusively designed for online multiplayer races plus all the story levels you have unlocked. Show off your fully customisable car, make it unique and make it the best. Challenge players from all over the world to gain the title of champions of Super Arcade Racing.

1138374576;Akemi - ChatBot;"Akemi is an application based on real dialogue that has AI (artificial intelligence) that´s able to hold a conversation with its user recognizing comments and questions you make, it´s able to perform questions and give coherent answers, capable of learning new terms, it allows you to find all the information you required pulled from a wide range of dictionaries and grows day after day. A question, an answer, a problem solved.

Internet connection is required to keep Akemi live and updated, any regular speed will suffice. 

Tips for a more pleasant conversation
  
Akemi is constantly evolving and its expressions correspond to an educated adult but its levels of understanding are still limited.

She can tell you what day it is; what time is it; calculate [2+5-3]; what it´s [dog], who is [Hercules]; search [history of World War II]; News [@LadyTanda]; antonyms and synonymous [black-white]; translate and spells; combines [swimming in future]; guess what I think; lists [1 to 10]; ask me something; make jokes; (Tell me your sign and give you your horoscope); learn [dog = I too like dogs]; weather in [city], etc. However, it still has limitations to recognize everyday language, especially when it does not obey simple structures.

The conversation will be more enjoyable if the suggestions below are followed:

1. Use simple and complete sentences (particularly in the answers):
  
- ""What is your name?"" instead of ""I don´t remember if said it, could you remind me what is your name"" or instead of just ""your name?""
- ""I'd rather watch TV"" instead of ""I do not like going to the movies, I prefer watching TV""
- ""I travel for work"" instead of ""for work""
- ""I'm John"" instead of ""Hello Akemi, is John again""

2. Use Standard English language avoiding argons:
- ""Tell who I am?"" instead of ""Whom am I?""

3. Prefers terms, tenses and simple expressions:
  
- ""Many people"" instead of ""there’s a multitude""
- ""I am surprised"" instead of ""I'm flabbergasted""
- ""I'd rather talk now"" instead of ""I would prefer to talk right now""
- ""Buy a car"" instead of ""I bought a car""

4. Avoid misspellings and/or slang.

5. Avoid double negation:

- ""I want to eat"" instead of ""I would not stay without eating""
- ""I do not like football"" instead of ""No, I do not like football""

6. If possible try to keep a conversation.

Legal note:
All trademarks, product names or services, companies, advertising phrases, famous quotes, artistic names, names of songs, series, movies, cartoons, among others cited during a conversation with Akemi are registered property of their respective owners."

* If a video does not cast, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. FAQ did not help? Please drop us a mail and give us the chance to help you before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.

528459889;TuneSpan for iTunes;"TuneSpan allows you to browse and span the media in your iTunes Library.

To “span” your media means to distribute the files in your iTunes Library across multiple drives.


“…the somewhat magical way that TuneSpan resolves the problem of having too much iTunes content makes this app a must-have for those with big media libraries.”
- Macworld / TechHive


» WHAT DOES TUNESPAN DO?

TuneSpan helps you easily move the media files (Music, Movies, etc.) in your iTunes Library to multiple drives, avoiding the pitfalls of moving files manually. TuneSpan lets you browse and keep track of media in your iTunes Library on all drives, whether they’re connected or not, and makes it clear to you what is and isn’t currently available to play in iTunes.


» HOW DO I USE TUNESPAN?

To select some tracks, drag anything from the browsing area and drop it into the blue gradient Spanlist. You can drag Playlists, Media Types, Genres, Artists, Albums, Tracks, and Locations. To view your selection and remove tracks, just click the Spanlist.

To choose the location to move your selected media to, click the Span Location area in the bottom middle of TuneSpan. Or, you can drag-and-drop a folder from Finder.

Also, TuneSpan now features automation! You can set up spans and restores to be executed on launch.


» WHY DO I NEED TUNESPAN?

There are several reasons you may need TuneSpan:

• You’re running out of space. You have a big iTunes Library on your internal drive and you want to move some (or all) of it to an external drive. TuneSpan helps you do this easily and seamlessly while cleaning up after itself and allowing you to always keep track of where everything is.

• You store a lot of Movies/TV Shows in iTunes and you want to re-organize your media (i.e., move all your videos to an external drive). With TuneSpan, you can easily select a whole Media Type and move the files wherever you choose, while continually being able to see where the files are, move them around again, or restore them easily.

• You need more space temporarily. TuneSpan offers a fast way to move gigabytes of files in your iTunes Library to free up space. Later, you can easily restore your files to their original locations while keeping your iTunes Library perfectly intact.

• You regularly add new Music, Movies, Podcasts, etc. With TuneSpan you can easily move older media (or media you don’t listen to as much) to an external drive while keeping your default iTunes Media location the same. This way, new stuff goes where it should and there’s always room for more.


» HOW DOES TUNESPAN WORK?

The spanning process is simple. TuneSpan makes copies of your media files at the selected Span Location; your media files are never deleted automatically. Once a file has been successfully copied, TuneSpan will set the new location in iTunes. That’s the spanning process for a track; copy its file and update its location in iTunes. By default, in the selected Span Location, TuneSpan will organize your files into folders just like iTunes. But, you can customize the folder organization. After tracks have been successfully spanned, you can choose to have the original files and empty folders moved to the Trash to help keep your system tidy.

TuneSpan does not directly modify the iTunes Library, but uses Apple Events (AppleScript) to set track locations.

And, you can keep working, playing, or enjoying your music in iTunes while TunesSpan does its job.


» IS THERE ANYTHING TUNESPAN CAN’T SPAN?

Unfortunately, TuneSpan can’t span files that aren’t included in the XML iTunes Library file. TuneSpan has no access to the following files; they are left untouched and unchanged:

Mobile Apps, Rented Movies, Ring Tones, Text-Based Books, PDFs, iTunes LPs, and iTunes Extras

Also, for SD and HD versions of videos, only HD versions can be spanned because of how iTunes lists them in the iTunes Library XML.

There is also a bug in iTunes that seems to cause some video files to be unable to span."

AS SEEN IN APPLE’S iPAD TV ADS
“MovieSlate® is the the Rolls-Royce of slates” says HandHeldHollywood.com. A convenient, all-in-one digital slate, clapper board, shot log, and notepad is used for film, TV, documentaries, music videos, and interviews, this professional production tool is the easy way to log footage and take notes as you shoot— saving you valuable time later when capturing/editing footage, and creating reports. All at a mere fraction of a bulky digital clapperboard’s cost.

SLATE
Tap a field to edit production info. Choose info from default/custom snippets, contacts, or saved history. Enter new info with the keyboard. Use the optimized keypad to quickly enter numeric info like: roll, scene, take, timecode. Or swipe up/down on fields to increment/decrement numbers.

TIMECODE
Entering timecode is easy with our optimized keypad. Sync to clock time, or an iTunes song (Music Video mode). With optional PRO Features in-app purchase: LTC/WiFi sync with: compatible cameras, recorders, generators, Timecode Systems Hubs, wireless timecode slates; and other MovieSlate apps.

CLAPPER
To begin a shot: photograph the slate’s production info, then tap the clapper sticks. Sticks open & clap closed, creating an audible/visible marker. All slate data is logged to history. Optional credits animations briefly display each production field, full screen.

NOTES
For each shot, you can: circle a take; rate sound/picture quality; write multiple shot notes; record voice notes; take picture notes. Example: when shooting interviews, create notes to timecode-mark when a particular question was asked, or something remarkable was said. Enter notes using the microphone, camera, keyboard— or insert snippet phrases (such as “Interview”, “Question”, or “Tail Sticks”).

LOG HISTORY
Get fast, searchable access to shot info, without wading through hours of footage. For each shot: all production, GPS location, and timecode data is stored to the app’s Shot Log History, where you can view, edit, or rate shots. History/Notes can be exported/emailed as: HTML, XML, CSV formats. Supports multiple projects.

CUSTOMIZE
Choose behaviors, layouts, sounds, themes (clapper/hinge designs, backgrounds, fonts, colors)— even your production logo on the slate and in reports.

1052606332;moviElect - Decide Which iTunes Movie or Rental to Watch for TV & Mobile;"METADATA

Hey there - have you ever enjoyed a film in the company of good friends, a spouse, or significant other? Deciding which movie to watch always goes pretty smoothly, right? … WRONG! Figuring out what to watch when given a seemingly limitless number of options sucks, a lot…. until now!

moviElect is an all new app for iPhone and Apple TV that will take the suck of deciding what to watch and turn it into a super fun virtual card game with friends. So here’s how it works:

 * Each person fires up the moviElect app on their iPhone and connects to your Apple TV, also running moviElect. 
 * Browse through movie cards, swipe up on the ones you like and watch as they magically fly from your phone to your Apple TV screen.
 * When everyone is satisfied with the movies you’ve tossed onto the TV, click a button on your Apple TV remote and moviElect will spit out a winner in seconds.

And that’s it! Once you’ve got a selection, head over to your movie app of choice and queue it up. 

The days of coming to blows with friends over how to spend Friday night are over. Say goodbye to an awkward evening on the couch with your husband/wife, one of you silently seething at the other because you’re stuck watching  Bride Wars instead of Star Wars. Put the conflict to bed by just letting a computer make the decision for you. 

moviElect - because life is too short to spend time deciding what to watch."

Fan fiction (alternatively referred to as fan-fiction or simply fic) is a broadly-defined fan labor term for stories about characters or settings written by fans of the original work, rather than by the original creator.

This is the definition of fanfiction according to American journalist Lev Grossman:

""Fan fiction is what literature might look like if it were reinvented from scratch after a nuclear apocalypse by a band of brilliant pop-culture junkies trapped in a sealed bunker. They don't do it for money. That's not what it's about. The writers write it and put it up online just for the satisfaction. They're fans, but they're not silent, couch-bound consumers of media. The culture talks to them, and they talk back to the culture in its own language.""
- TIME, July 07, 2011

Another fanfiction definition according to media scholar Henry Jenkins:

""Fan fiction can be seen as an unauthorized expansion of these media franchises into new directions which reflect the reader's desire to ""fill in the gaps"" they have discovered in the commercially produced material.""

1249389469;Screen Mirroring Panasonic TV;"Please enable DMR (Digital Media Renderer) in TV Settings: WIth your remote control, go to: Menu / Setup / Network / Application / DMR: ON

Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Panasonic Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Panasonic TV.

This works on any Panasonic Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. For the latest Panasonic TV models, please enable DMR (Digital Media Renderer) in TV Settings: WIth your remote control, go to: Menu / Setup / Network / Application / DMR: ON

In using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

How the app works:

1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Panasonic TV. 

2. Launch the Mirror for Panasonic TV app. It will start looking for your Panasonic TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Panasonic TV, the TV might ask you to ""allow"" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.

3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.

4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.

5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Panasonic TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.

Limitations and known issues:

DRM

Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.

There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:

Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.

You can purchase the Mirror for Panasonic TV Pro Version through an in app purchase.

The Pro Version has the following features:
1. Adds audio to the screen mirroring
2. Provides for free lifetime updates of the app
3. Gives the option to choose higher screen resolutions, like 720p and 1080p

* Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.
* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.
* Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.

Requirements
? Mac (well duh)
? Canon Digital SLR connected by USB to the Mac - may work with other brands (not tested)
? Remote picture trigger requires alternative input (USB button input) and use of 3rd party software such as USB Overdrive
? Optional: AppleTV on the same LAN as the Mac for Airplay and use of 2nd remote monitor, with switch or wireless router
? Optional: Dual monitors on the Mac - you can dedicate the 2nd one to picture display
? Optional: USB (iSight compatable) camera so guests can see themselves before taking pictures
? Optional: PreRoll Countdown, Flash, and PostRoll movies - if you wish to change the existing ones
? Optional: Fancy secure box to hold the Mac, Camera, and other accessories to bring this all together in a turn-key solution


OK, so what is really going on here?

Once upon a time there were things called PhotoBooth's in various public locations. You could go into the photobooth, close the curtain, pay your money and the booth would take a series of pictures. Then you'd wait for those pictures to be processed and collect your little strip of 4 or so pictures.
Lets roll this idea forward a few decades... and step up what is possible.
This photo studio is based on the photobooth using the latest of technology to deliver ""realtime"" photos to the guests. At a wedding you can capture moments that your guests create and have them displayed on a big screen TV, over Airplay, behind the happy couple. The moments are more than just for the event, they can become a precious reminder of that happy occasion when reviewed later.

What do I need to do? Here is a setup scenario. You can vary accordingly to suit your requirements.
1. Small bookcase, can hold all of the critical hardware. MacMini, Digital SLR.
2. The bookcase is custom modified so that the camera is held securely in place by the tripod mount, and a slot to accomodate the flash. As you plan for this setup, consider how to change the batteries in the camera and flash.
3. You'll need a table and monitor so that your guests can see what is going on, and the countdown timers for taking pictures, and the iSite camera picture feed.
4. You will need some form of remote USB input to trigger picture taking (remember this needs to be guest proof). I used one of these... https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DIY-Handle-Arcade-Set-Kits-24mm-30mm-Push-Buttons-5-Pin-Joystick-Replacement-Parts-USB-Cable/32684756546.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.lEz8z6 - ""DIY Handle Arcade Set Kits 24mm/30mm Push Buttons 5 Pin Joystick Replacement Parts USB Cable Encoder Board To PC Joystick&Button"". You have to build something to hold the buttons and have the input wired back to the Mac. The application allows you to take a single picture - now, or a series of pictures with a countdown timer that is presented on the screen.
5. You also need some software that can map the USB input to the key commands that trigger pictures. There are at least two options for this:
http://joystickmapper.com
http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/News.html
6. With an AppleTV and the Mac setup to Airplay to it as a second screen, you can move the photos window to the second screen, switch it to full screen display and the images will automatically change as per the preference settings. The AppleTV and Mac need to be on the same network, wired or wireless. So you may need a wireless router to get Airplay working. And you'd want to put this into the box holding the MacMini and camera."

1249389812;Sony TV Miracast + Mirroring;"Enjoy anything on the big screen without any hassle. Just wirelessly connect your phone or tablet to your Sony TV. Finally, you can get rid of those annoying and unsafe cables. You don't need expensive hardware either.

In less than 5 minutes you can make your life easier and more comfortable. Get this app and screen mirror, cast or stream anything to your TV from your iOS device. 

This works on any Sony Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. 

In using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

Enjoy series, movies, sport, live streams, breaking news or web videos. In big size of course! 

How the app works:

1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Sony TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.

2. Launch the Mirror for Sony TV app. It will start looking for your Sony TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Sony TV, the TV might ask you to ""allow"" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.

3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.

4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.

5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Sony TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.

Limitations and known issues:

DRM

Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.

There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:

Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.

You can purchase the Mirror for Sony TV Pro Version through an in app purchase.

The Pro Version has the following features:
1. Adds audio to the screen mirroring
2. Provides for free lifetime updates of the app
3. Gives the option to choose higher screen resolutions, like 720p and 1080p

* Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.
* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.
* Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.
* Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

“I REALLY love this app; I think it’s got so much merit. I think it’s great because the kids are experiencing something, they're being physical, they're solving problems, they're building stuff, they're creating… It’s not that idea of sitting on a device and flicking through and staring at a video. It’s super interactive.” – One More Page Podcast

KIDS DEVELOPMENT
•	Experiences are highly physical and movement-based; getting kids up and moving
•	A high-quality digital experience without the screens
•	Encourages imaginative play
•	Encourages social/emotional skills development through teamwork, collaboration, empathy
•	Great for parents and kids to play together 
•	A new way to engage with books and stories, by playing as a character

YOU WILL NEED

•	A wifi network 
•	One device per player (ideally pocket-sized so you can move around easily)
•	One pair of headphones per player
•	Some simple household items – seem episode info for details

HOW DOES IT WORK
Kids/families play together in small groups using simple, accessible household items (blankets, cushions, chairs etc) to create the imagined story world. Each player will need a mobile device and a pair of headphones as each player hears the story from their character's point of view. Players then follow along with the story, playing out the action as instructed through the audio.

Audioplay is something akin to a play-along podcast or building blanket forts with a soundtrack only much better as everyone hears the story from a different character’s point of view.

___________________________________________

HOW IT WORKS...

1. Choose from the dozens of backgrounds provided by the app (a solid color, a gradient color, an image, a ""seamless"" video loop, or a ""green-screen"" chroma key), or upload your own background image or video.

2. Enter the text you want to have scroll over the background you've selected. You can even use headings or two columns for your credits, just like the pros.

3. Preview what your scrolling credits will look like, adjusting the scrolling speed, aspect ratio, and the font style, color, and size.

4. When you're happy with how everything looks, the app will render and save an HD video clip to your device's Photo Library (Camera Roll). 

5. Optionally, you can use iMovie or other video editing software, import the credits video clip, and drag it to where you want it to play in your movie (such as at the end for closing credits).

454695815;COLORCODE VJ;"Suited for both hobby and professional use, COLORCODE VJ quickly turns your iPad into a VJ tool. At your home or at an event, it's never been easier to become a VJ!

COLORCODE VJ can switch and display movies, images, and texts. You can also output to external displays via separately available adapters (*1). 

***We stongly recommend to use with iPad2, because of the hardware limitations (lack of CPU power and available memory) of iPad1. It will be difficult to use comfortably with iPad1. 


=What you can do with COLORCODE VJ=
- Load, mix, and output movie files. 
(You can display up to 2 movies simultaneously) 
- Overlay PNG image files. You can move the images by touching on the screen, or preset the movement in advance. PNG transparency is supported. 
- Display texts. Like images, texts can also be moved. 
- Play tracks in your Music library as BGM (*2).
-The sound of video can be played now.
- Output to external displays such as your TV, PC monitor, and projector. (*1)  Works with most recent LCD TVs! 
- You can use a Internal Camera on iPad.


=Recommended use=
- As part of a full-fledged VJ equipment set. 
You can even get up on the stage with your iPad while VJing! 
- As a VJ tool for musicians. 
COLORCODE VJ offers musicians a quick way to play movies in addition to their instruments. 
Take control of both music and images to add depth to your expression! 
- As a party tool 
Simply hook up your iPad to a TV or monitor and start VJing! You can also show movies that were filmed with your iPad. 
A video slideshow? No problem! 
- As a presentation tool 
While there are many presentation tools for iPad, COLORCODE VJ may be the one for you when a simple slideshow just doesn't cut it. 
Tweak your presentation to match the atmosphere for a successful presentation! 
- As a simple digital signage 
Connect your iPad to a monitor and play movies for in-store promotions. 


=COLORCODE VJ Basics=

- COLORCODE VJ has 2 modes of operation. 
Edit mode for preparing your VJ play, and Play mode for performing the actual VJ play. 
Note that output to external display will be disabled under Edit mode. 
- Is an external display a must? Absolutely not! 
COLORCODE VJ will work perfectly fine with just your iPad. 
It's a lot more fun with an external monitor though! 
- In iPad, since there are few memories and the capability of CPU is also low, the COLORCODEVJ cannot run comfortably.

Our Terms of Use: http://bit.ly/ToU-MfC
Our Privacy Policy: http://bit.ly/ABTVPrivacy

Limitations and known issues:

DRM

Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.

There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:

Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.

About Screen Recording and Privacy

Even though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.

If you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.

1243586902;Werewords;"The Werewords™ app is used with the game Werewords to run the night phase, generate Magic Words, and perform timer options for players. This app requires either the physical Werewords or Werewords Deluxe Edition game, sold by Bezier Games, Inc. (purchase on Amazon or at beziergames.com)

In Werewords, players guess a secret word by asking “yes” or “no” questions. Figure out the magic word before time is up, and you win!

However, one of the players is secretly a werewolf who is not only working against you, but also knows the word. If you don’t guess the word in time, you can still win by identifying the werewolf!

To help you out, one player is the Seer, who knows the word, but has to be careful not be too obvious when helping you gure it out; if the word is guessed, the Werewolf can pull out a win by identifying the Seer!

If the logo at the top of the app screen does not match the logo on your box, tap the settings button (gear) and then tap the box at the top of the settings screen that matches your version of the game.

Choose the roles you are using in the game, then tap the Play button to start the game. The app will ask all of the players to close their eyes, then wake up the Mayor and any other selected roles in order. Then the app will ask all player to open their eyes, and the day timer will start. If the players guess the Magic Word before time is up, the Mayor taps the ""Correct"" button, and then the Werewolves can still win if they figure out who the Seer is. If the players do NOT get the Magic word before time is up (or if they run out of Yes/No tokens), the players can still win by figuring out who one of the werewolves is.

The Werewords app also includes the following options (tap the gear to adjust them):
-- Over 40,000 words in four different difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Ridiculous)
-- Built-in themed wordlists such as Movies, 80s, Music, 50s & 60s, Literature, Food, TV, Video Games, Monsters, Animals, Hobbies, and Celebrities
-- the ability to create custom word lists
-- Load community word lists from werewords.com
-- Use multiple wordlists in the same game
-- The ability to adjust the in game and day phase timers
-- The ability to adjust how many words the Mayor may pick from
-- The ability to have proper nouns on or off (or even just proper nouns)
-- a custom soundtrack
-- Speedwords (for owners of Werewords Deluxe Edition)

See the in-app help for more details.

Werewords is designed by Ted Alspach, the game designer of other popular games such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Suburbia, Silver, Ultimate Werewolf, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig.

(DISH Anywhere users that do not own one of the above supported receivers but do have an online DISH account can still use the On Demand and Live Stream features of the app).

This app features Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software, which will allow you to contribute to market research, like Nielsen’s TV Ratings. Please see www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy for more information.

*Transfer functionality requires high-speed internet connection to a Hopper 2 or Hopper 3 DVR. Your mobile device must be connected to the same home network as the Hopper2 or Hopper 3 to transfer a recording and you must maintain an active DISH account to view transferred recordings. Select recordings are not available to transfer due to programming restrictions. Sling Adapter functionality is not supported.

“The RiffTrax app syncs everything up perfectly.” - CNET

“Rifftrax app takes the guesswork out of syncing jokes to film. It’s easier than ever to sync MST3K-like commentary. The app uses your device’s microphone to listen for a movie and automatically syncs Rifftrax playback to the film. It’s simple and easy...” - Engadget

“The app can recognize movies from Netflix, iTunes, Amazon Video, DVDs, Blu-rays, your TV, computer, and other streams.” - High-Def Digest 

“Video content (VOD) coming soon!” - RiffTrax Team

1233157745;Mirror for Fire TV;"Application to mirror the screen and audio of your Mac to an Amazon Fire TV. You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your Fire TV. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your TV!

Before using this application, please go to the Amazon website and install the (free) Mirror Receiver for Fire TV: http://bit.ly/am-firetv

In using the app, there will be a about 2 to 3 seconds of latency (lag). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

1. Restart your router. Just take out the power plug, wait 10 seconds and put it back in. This resets your router and will make your home network faster and more stable. Why this works? Routers are in essence little computers, with software. Software will have small memory leaks and some processes will stop working correctly over time. That’s why it is a good idea to reset your router once in a while. Our recommendation: once a week. 

2. Don’t do network intense work while screen mirroring. As explained, screen mirroring is network intense. For the best performance, don’t do other network intense work at the same time. This includes making timemachine backups over the network and uploading/downloading large files from the internet while screen mirroring.

3. Put your Mac and your Fire TV on the same router channel. Some routers (dual band) have create both a 2.4Ghz and a 5Ghz wireless network. For the best performance, put your Mac and your Fire TV on the same network. Preferably the 5Ghz network. But definitely not the Mac on 5Ghz and the Fire TV on 2.4Ghz, because that will negatively impact the performance of screen mirroring.

4. Use an AC or N router. Newer routers support Wifi AC and N. Older routers might only have Wifi B and/or G. B and G are not really up to scratch anymore for modern networking tasks, so go for an AC or N router. If your router supports AC and N, also make sure that your router is set to use either the Wifi N or Wifi AC networking. 

How the app works:
First, make sure that your Fire TV is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your Fire TV on the network. It will show your Fire TV when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

Settings (the icon in the bottom right of the app): click here to request support from our 24/7 support staff. They usually respond within 2 hours on any query that you might have. If your question is technical, please also include the diagnostics information.

Limitations: Apple has HDCP DRM protection for playing iTunes movies. This means that screen mirroring is not possible when watching movies from iTunes.

When you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!

Here comes a macOS Core Audio level mute control app! It will block any microphone requests from any app.

Attention: iMute is NOT a simple mute switch as some users described! It goes far beyond guarding your microphone and preventing any app or website from turning it on. It will protect you from being monitored by a hacker or malicious websites. 

Your MacBook's built-in microphone is precise and sensitive, but by default, it is always on, you can not mute your mic without deep into system preferences. If you wish to mute your microphone for security or other reasons, you need iMute! 

iMute is displayed on top of all other apps, and it mutes your mic, guaranteed. It is perfect for use with FACETIME, SKYPE, and other communication software to ensure a muted Mic. 

To witness iMute's ability, you may open up the sound panel under system preferences and notice that even if the input volume is minimal, you can still see that the microphone is still capturing your voice and the input indicators are flashing. You may notice that even while you are listening to music or watching movies, your microphone is still on. 
But with iMute running, the microphone is guaranteed to be muted! 

In addition, iMute will double-check the mute status every 2 minutes to secure you from hackers trying to access your mic. 
* iMute is to mute your mic, to mute the speaker please use beQUIET.

Try the first chroma-key camera of the AppStore and capture amazing videos and photos.

Even if you are not familiar with this term, you have seen this effect on TV, when actors are shot against the green screen that later is replaced by burning cars, collapsing skyscrapers or aliens. 
With Chromakey Camera, you can create your own videos and photos with the very same effect. Just shoot your video/photo in front of solid color backdrops/wall/material, and the apps makes this solid color transparent and add any background video clip or photo. Get the power of the professional editing tool on your iPhone and iPad!

You want to see yourself on the beach, or in an exotic country? Use one of the 50 embedded backgrounds and travel around the world.
You want to become an actor in your favorites movies? Import your personal videos and play with the stars.
With Chromakey Camera, you can also clone people, make people talk to themselves, remove people body parts, make people fly or dive... The special effects you can create are endless !

The best of all, you don't need a green screen studio to use the app: a simple green/blue wall, blanket, or fabric is sufficient to obtain very good results.

Special features:
- Multiple modes: record videos and snap photos, by adding a video or a photo background
- Videos backgrounds: 29 embedded video backgrounds (Eiffel Tower, Beach, Mountain, Waterfall, Underwater, Flying, Flags, News studio...). 
- Photos backgrounds: 23 embedded photo backgrounds (Angkor Wat, Bali, Hong Kong, Singapore, French Alps, Reunion Volcano, Jungle, Halong Bay...)
- Special effects: use a video or photo captured with the app and create outstanding effects (duplicate/clone yourself, talk to yourself, remove a part of your body...)
- Use your personal videos and photos as background: import videos and photos from your camera roll, or import videos and photos with the iTunes file sharing features, and use them as background
- Use the video background sound to create even more realistic effects !
- Capture video and photo background with the app to create special effects
- Camera control: set the focus and exposure separately, zoom while recording videos
- Support any backdrop color: just double tap the backdrop on you video to select its color and replace it, with your selected background, on your videos and photos 
- High resolution videos: capture videos in full HD on the iPhone 5S and newer and on the iPad Air and newer, 720p on the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 and 4, 480p on the other devices

Satisfied users have described this app as ""awesome"" and ""a godsend"".

Subtitles available in English, Spanish(Español), Arabic(???????), Bengali, Chinese(??), Danish(dansk), Dutch(Nederlands), French(français), German(Deutsch), Greek(????????), Japanese(???), Javanese(basa Jawa), Hebrew(?????), Italian(italiano), Korean(???), Malay(bahasa Melayu), Polish(jezyk polski), Portuguese(português), Punjabi, Russian(??????? ????), Sweden(Svenska), Thai(???), Turkish(Türkçe) and Vietnamese(Tieng Viet).

1173947380;Mirror for Sony TV;"Application to mirror the screen of your Mac to any Sony Bravia Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your TV. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your TV!

This works on any Sony Smart TV from the 2012 models onwards.

In using the app, there will be about 1 to 2 seconds of latency. So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

- Preferably, connect your TV by LAN cable to your router.
- Use an ""ac""  router. If you don't have one, then an ""n"" router.
- Try not to overload your wifi network by moving big files around while you are mirroring.

How the app works:
First, make sure that your Sony TV is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. The TV should not be in screen mirroring mode, but just on ""TV"" Mode or any HDMI IN port.
 
After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your TV on the network. It will show your TV when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

Settings (the icon in the bottom right of the app): click here to request support from our 24/7 support staff. They usually respond within 2 hours on any query that you might have. If your question is technical, please also include the diagnostics information.

Limitations: Apple has HDCP DRM protection for playing iTunes movies. This means that screen mirroring is not possible when watching movies from iTunes.

When you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!

1152966194;Mirror for LG Smart TV;"Application to mirror the screen of your Mac to any LG Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your TV. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your TV!

This works on any LG Smart TV from the 2012 models onwards. And the LG Home Theater System.

In using the app, there will be about 2 to 3 seconds of latency. So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

- Preferably, connect your TV by LAN cable to your router.
- Use an ""ac""  router. If you don't have one, then an ""n"" router.
- Try not to overload your wifi network by moving big files around while you are mirroring.

How the app works:
First, make sure that your LG TV is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. The TV should not be in screen mirroring mode, but just on ""TV"" Mode or any HDMI IN port.
 
After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your TV on the network. It will show your TV when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

Settings (the icon in the bottom right of the app): click here to request support from our 24/7 support staff. They usually respond within 2 hours on any query that you might have. If your question is technical, please also include the diagnostics information.

Limitations: Apple has HDCP DRM protection for playing iTunes movies. This means that screen mirroring is not possible when watching movies from iTunes.

When you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!

HOW IT WORKS

Web Video Cast™ is a browser, which allows you to stream videos of movies, TV shows, and other media from the internet to a streaming device or smart tv. Web Video Caster grabs the video URL inside the web page, sends it to the streaming device (i.e. Chromecast or DLNA device), and then plays the video directly from the content provider. This ultimately saves your mobile device’s battery. It also detects subtitles on the web page. Web Video Cast™ does not host these videos. This is not a mirroring app.


GET STARTED

Follow these simple step-by-step instructions to start streaming:

1. Find a video online that you want to watch.

2. Make sure this video can play on mobile browsers without Flash.

3. Connect to your streaming device.

4. Play the video as you normally would. Or, click the play button on the toolbar.

PREMIUM FEATURES**

1249385711;Screen Mirroring Samsung TV;"#1 app to screen mirroring your iPhone or iPad to Samsung Smart TV.

Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror anything from your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.

To mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.
Enjoy everything on TV from your iPhone, iPad & Mac.

This works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).

E = 2012
F = 2013
H = 2014
J = 2015
K = 2016
M = 2017
N = 2018
R = 2019
T = 2020
Q = QLED (also supported)

For instance:

UE55_E_S8000 = 2012.
UE78_H_U8500L = 2014.

In using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

How the app works:

1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.

2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to ""allow"" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.

3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.

4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.

5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.

Limitations and known issues:

DRM

Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.

You can purchase the Mirror for Samsung TV Pro Version through an in app purchase.

The Pro Version has the following features:
1. Adds audio to the screen mirroring
2. Provides for free lifetime updates of the app
3. Gives the option to choose higher screen resolutions, like 720p and 1080p

1174379274;Empire TV Tycoon;"In Empire TV Tycoon you manage a television channel and take on the fight for audiences while leading your business to fame and fortune. You will choose the content of your channel, select advertisers, hire staff and actors, manage your own show productions, and much more! The game was inspired by games like Mad TV, Mud TV and other movie management games, with a modern approach on how to produce custom content like movies or TV shows. Yet you better not be tempted to use illegal content! Just like in real life, pirated movies may be cheaper, but the risk of using them is high and police forces are always on the alert.

Each audience group has their likes and dislikes. Make them happy and your fame will grow, make the wrong choices and your channel will never be talked about again. While you work your way through the markets, your advertisers will increase their demand and possibly request the impossible – it is up to you to fulfill their requests.
Your walk of fame will also rely on the proficiency and level of expertise of your staff, so always keep an eye on them!

Not only will you produce TV shows, you will also produce and direct movies that are based on personalized and randomized movie scripts with lots of combinations fitting every genre. Your work as a director will influence the quality of the productions’ outcome , last but not least because you know how to handle the strengths and weaknesses of conceited or frustrated actors as well.

For even more publicity and success with your movie business, you will submit your productions to top notch industry awards in different  categories.

And the Oscar goes to...?


FEATURES

- Manage your own TV Channel in all aspects of the business 
- Determine which content is best for the audience, increase your fame and win the market battle
- Over 1,000 movies to choose from
- Work with TV behind the scenes staff as well as actors, directors and advertisers
- Distribute your resources in the best way that you can think for each available movie genre.
- Discover secrets and surprises that happened to the movie industry in the last 50 years


WHAT THE MEDIA SAYS

“Empire TV Tycoon is a good game with a relaxed but absorbing pace and a great deal of choice to give it depth. If you like simulation games and tycoon games in particular, you should give it a try.” 
Indie Games 

“What makes Empire TV Tycoon enjoyable, is choice – there’s never an immediately obvious way to go about besting your rivals.”

668459828;Crossword Solver;"This app will help you solve English crosswords and other similar word games. The application uses the letters you already know to find a list of possible answers.

It has many advantages compared to similar applications:

1) Contains many thousands of Proper Nouns, including full names, professions, nationality, date of birth and death for about 60,000 famous people, plus around 26,000 places, i.e. countries, cities, rivers, mountains etc. It also knows the names and other data of 90,000 popular movies, books, comics, bands, songs, albums, works of art, deities and fictional characters. These proper nouns are essential for solving general knowledge clues, which can make up to 20-25% of crossword clues. These clues are the type that you either know them or you don't, i.e. difficult to just guess, so if you do not know a particular person you are usually stuck
2) Provides filters to reduce the list of possible answers. This is essential when only a few letters are known. For example, you can filter out rarely used words.
3) Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries. 36 languages are currently available (see below)
4) Contains 5 different modes for help solving Crosswords, Anagrams, Synonyms, Codewords and Cryptic Crosswords. Codeword mode allows the user to specify which letters are already known (and hence not considered for the unknown letters), and which unknown letters are the same (i.e have the same Codeword number). Cryptic mode contains extra help with many examples
5) Solves ""two word"" answers. This is very useful in combination with first and last names of famous people. It also finds ""two word"" anagrams
6) View answers in multiple columns. Optimized use of screen space. Takes full advantage of size of tablet
7) Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically
8) The dictionary also contains some foreign language words. These are often found in some crosswords. Foreign words are English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Latin
9) Contains about 150,000 synonyms, using the built-in thesaurus, to help find the solution from the clue.

All of these features are available without an internet connection, and are rarely found in similar applications.

Other features unique to this app:

- Lightning fast search engine. No search button needed as possible matches are displayed instantly as you type
- Comprehensive list of 300,000+ normal words, split into common and rare lists to help you find the right match
- View detailed word definition of the possible answers (internet connection required)
- Link to the wiki page for famous people, places, films, books etc. (internet connection required)
- App can be downloaded onto an SD card

The following dictionaries are supported: English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Polish, Hungarian, Czech, Russian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Indonesian, Romanian, Serbian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak, Slovene, Turkish, Ukrainian, Afrikaans, Albanian, Azeri, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Catalan, Galician, Tagalog"

??? Can you score 1400 points ???
!!!! The world best record so far is 1800 !!!!

Temple Run Training - Retro Games X is game designed to improve your temple run skills by using the same game mechanic but cranking up the speed and difficulty. 

So so easy to play. When the arrows go between the white bars swipe your finger in the direction of the arrow. For example, swipe your finger left when a left arrow goes between the bars. Last as long as you can. It's that simple :)

Similar in style to DDR and the Tap Tap Revenge series, Temple Run Training - Retro Games X is an addictive little gem that anyone can play. The first 20 seconds are just a warm up, once the arrows start spawning faster it's time to start working that calculator brain of yours.

The word is Temple Run Training - Retro Games X is becoming one of the best games in the market and is getting more and more downloads each day. Game players have gone crazy sitting on their butt, on the subway, on the school bus all day trying to top their best score, so be careful, it's addictive ;D

1800 is the worlds best record so far. If you beat this score, please send us a screenshot or video capture and we will post it here for the world to see.

The style is inspired by early retro video games such as defender, space invaders, and consoles such as the atari 2600 and vetrex (vector line graphics console). The Temple Run Training - Retro Games X style is also influenced by neo retro games such as geometry wars, and the movies tron and rez.

Temple Run Training - Retro Games X is also part of the X series of pro games by Cobalt Play. These little jewels are training style games which improve your skill in other games. If you're great at one of these you'll scare your friends and school them with your amazing mobile game skills

The X series includes:

1228140167;Mirror for Android TV;"Application to mirror the screen and sound of your Mac to Android TV. Works on any TV, settop box or Media Player with the Android TV operating system.

You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your Android TV. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your TV!

App has been tested to work with:
- Philips Android TV
- Sony Android TV
- Bouygues Bbox Miami

In using the app, there will be a about 2 to 3 seconds of latency (lag). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

1. Restart your router. Just take out the power plug, wait 10 seconds and put it back in. This resets your router and will make your home network faster and more stable. Why this works? Routers are in essence little computers, with software. Software will have small memory leaks and some processes will stop working correctly over time. That’s why it is a good idea to reset your router once in a while. Our recommendation: once a week. 

2. Don’t do network intense work while screen mirroring. As explained, screen mirroring is network intense. For the best performance, don’t do other network intense work at the same time. This includes making timemachine backups over the network and uploading/downloading large files from the internet while screen mirroring.

3. Put your Mac and your Android TV on the same router channel. Some routers (dual band) have create both a 2.4Ghz and a 5Ghz wireless network. For the best performance, put your Mac and your TV on the same network. Preferably the 5Ghz network. But definitely not the Mac on 5Ghz and the TV on 2.4Ghz, because that will negatively impact the performance of screen mirroring.

4. Use an AC or N router. Newer routers support Wifi AC and N. Older routers might only have Wifi B and/or G. B and G are not really up to scratch anymore for modern networking tasks, so go for an AC or N router. If your router supports AC and N, also make sure that your router is set to use either the Wifi N or Wifi AC networking. 

How the app works:
First, make sure that your Android TV is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. The TV should not be in screen mirroring mode, but just on ""TV"" Mode or any HDMI IN port.
 
After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your TV on the network. It will show your TV when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

Settings (the icon in the bottom right of the app): click here to request support from our 24/7 support staff. They usually respond within 2 hours on any query that you might have. If your question is technical, please also include the diagnostics information.

Limitations: Apple has HDCP DRM protection for playing iTunes movies. This means that screen mirroring is not possible when watching movies from iTunes.

When you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!

426201096;Chordelia Triad Tutor - learn to hear Major, Minor, Augmented and Diminished chords - for the beginner and advanced musician who plays Guitar, Ukulele, Sax and more;"Join thousands of other musicians who've used Triad Tutor to improve their ears for chords!

From the makers of the best-selling ear training app RelativePitch, ""Chordelia: Triad Tutor"" teaches you to recognise the most important types of chord in a fun, simple way - even if you've never learned about chords or music theory before.

Some recent App Store reviews:
""Worth ten times the price... seriously!""
""Like Relative Pitch, it makes ear training fun.""
""I've been training and testing for the past few days, and I've improved my knowledge of chords more quickly than any other method I've tried.""


• Do you sometimes struggle to tell which chords in a song are major or minor?

• Have you heard about chord inversions, but don't know what they are, or how to tell them apart by ear?

• Are you looking for a way to spice up your song-writing and create more interesting, compelling chord progressions?

Chordelia: Triad Tutor teaches you the 4 core types of chord you need to know to tackle these real-world musical challenges. By learning to recognise major, minor, augmented, and diminished 'triads', you'll boost your musical creativity and perception, and build a foundation for learning more advanced chords like seventh chords, extended chords, and suspended chords.

You'll learn how to:

• Distinguish major and minor chords - instantly, effortlessly, and reliably
• Recognise the unusual sounds of augmented and diminished chords and how they can enhance a song
• Identify all these chord types, whichever inversion is used - and know which inversion it is!

Chordelia: Triad Tutor uses the same approach as our best-selling interval training app, RelativePitch, which has helped thousands of musicians learn to hear intervals easily and reliably. You'll get the information you need for each topic, and can then train and test your ear to learn the material at your own pace. Using the app for even just five minutes a day will noticeably improve your chord skills!

If you get stuck, the lessons can be adjusted to meet your needs and help you pinpoint difficulties. The app automatically tracks your progress too, so you'll know that you're improving.

Maybe you've spent some time training intervals with RelativePitch and want to extend your skills to chords. Or perhaps you're an experienced musician who wants to make sure they have the fundamentals rock-solid. Or you could be a complete beginner who wants to understand what makes chords tick.

Whatever your background, Chordelia: Triad Tutor will quickly get you up to speed with the most important types of chord, and develop your musical ear in an easy, fun and effective way.

Chordelia: Triad Tutor features 7 different instruments sounds, including guitar, piano, and real human voices!

""Fun and easy to use, Chordelia's been very educational already in training me on the differences between chords. It's fun to learn (some of) the theory on chords, train my ear a bit, and then apply that to the music I hear around me (recorded music, tv shows/movies, etc.) It has helped to deepen my understanding of that music, in particular how the use of specific kinds of chords - and the emotions that those chords evoke - tie closely with the content of the music/scene."" - US App Store review

1478356887;Smart Converter Pro 3;"The fastest video converter on the App Store with movie and TV show metadata, subtitles, folder monitoring and batch conversions.  Smart Converter Pro 3 is our best version yet.

It’s so easy to use - just drag your video or audio files onto Smart Converter Pro, select an output preset and convert. Smart Converter Pro analyses your files and only converts the bits that need to be converted. This means less waiting and top quality conversions. 

The Pro Difference 
============= 

Smart Converter Pro offers a bunch of amazing features to make your conversions quicker, smarter and more convenient: 
* Folder monitoring - convert anything that hits your monitored folders
* Movie and TV Show info - automatically add key info about your movies 
* Subtitles - include subtitles, add external subtitles and even load subtitles from the web!
* Audio tracks - include any or all of the audio tracks in your movies

* Set destination - you decide where you converted files go

Why So Smart? 
========== 

When you drop a media file into Smart Converter Pro and choose a conversion type, it immediately analyses your file and works out what needs to be converted. 

In many cases neither the video nor the audio need converting. In some cases just one or the other need converting, and in a few cases both will need converting. 

Smart Converter Pro only converts the parts of your movie that need it and leaves the rest alone. This makes Smart Converter Pro faster that every other converter while maintaining the highest possible quality video an audio in the converted movie.

Awesome Workflow Support

This network is designed with a very specific aim in mind…. “Bringing Families Back together”. It’s developed to engage people to rethink community. We speak to the children, teens, young adults and the grandparents.

  What’s the common denominator between most TV channels and their audience? We’ve become immune. Love doesn’t feel the same anymore….violence has become commonplace….and sex is overrated. It’s OK for the family to watch entertainment on OKTV. Our programming is based on the needs of the people, not what the‘Big Networks” dictate we should be watching.

Like the networks of the past, when TV programming actually meant something, we provide quality, original scripted programs, reality TV, specials, movies, and comedies.

We strive to provide our viewers with positive content that enlightens, amuses, and makes them hungry for more—this is exactly what OK TV is all about!"

957722709;Epic 90s Word Search - giant nineties wordsearch;"Man, this word search is THE BOMB!  With over 1,600 words in a massive 120x120 grid, it's all that and a bag of chips.  Whatever.

Use two fingers to scroll around the massive grid, then drag with one finger to highlight a word. Zoom out at any time to see a summary of your progress. 

The puzzle is arranged as 16 themed sections, each containing around 100 words. 

To solve the entire thing, you'll need to take a trip back to the 90s.  Rock out with Nirvana, collect Beanie Babies, lose hours playing on your Game Boy and celebrate Nelson Mandela's freedom.  While you're there, why not watch some classic 90s TV and movies too?

Earn Game Center achievements along the way and compare your progress to others on the global leaderboard. 

Epic 90s Word Search was compiled from user submissions in Word Search Party, also by Lightwood Games. Like our record-besting game Word Search 10K, it has been hand-crafted to form one continuous puzzle with words in every direction. 

If you have any questions or comments please send an email to support@lightwoodgames.com. We cannot reply to you if you leave messages in your reviews, so please contact us first if you’re having any problems.

? Why do I need a VPN?
Cases of identity theft are on the raise as cyber criminals take advantage of security loop holes found on personal devices and public networks to steal vital personal information such as emails, password, bank account log ins and more. When you connect on a public Wifi network at any public location without a VPN, you are sending all your activity and information through an unsecured pathway that can be monitored and stolen by any malicious entities without you ever knowing. Even your home network is not always safe as security loop holes in devices such as routers and smartphones are constantly being found and exploited by cyber criminals on a regular basis. Security patches and updates offered by developers for their products are often released only after a security breach has been exploited and the damage has been done. With Cosmos VPN, no matter what network you are connected to, all of your internet activity is encrypted and untraceable to cyber criminals looking to steal your information.

1442232916;Mind Dive;"MIND DIVE is a meditation and yoga App based on the successful program of Meditation For Daily Stress, created by Michel Pascal, and developed for the parolees, and faculty at Amity Foundation LA.  Eighty percent of the Amity parolees have experienced life changing results, finding jobs and rebuilding their families and never returning to prison. This is the highest success rate of parolees in America. 

MIND DIVE has a powerful search feature called “My Mood.” You can use this to find resources in the app to help you based on how you are feeling, how you want to feel, what you are interested in right now.

All the content is video based and you can listen or watch depending on where you are and what you need.
 
MIND DIVE is a revolutionary new approach to mindfulness that will change your perception of meditation. Immediately you will be guided to practice inside your stressful situations, rather than practicing far from these disturbing situations when you are calm. You will be able to watch videos that will teach you how to be calmer in the traffic, how to stop your brain from running all of the time, how to recycle stressful energies, how to cope with trauma, PTSD and the many other exhausting emotions you experience. 

MIND DIVE  is not only teaching you how to meditate in your daily life, but also how to practice yoga in your daily life. Sonya Om, Disciple of Sri Dharma Mittra, will be guiding you through  instructional yoga videos. These tutorials are adapted to multiple levels of practice from beginning to advanced and will encourage you to incorporate yoga into your daily life.
 
MIND DIVE presents exclusive documentaries with some of the top scientists and researchers of America; Dr. Gary Schwartz PH.D, Dr. Mario Beauregard PH.D, Dr. Diane Hennacy Powell MD, Dr.Deepak Chopra MD, Dr. Menas Kafatos and the spiritual leader Dr. Michael Beckwith (Founder of Agape). 
 
MIND DIVE is much more than a regular App, it is like a TV channel, where you can watch informational films on suicide prevention, neuroscience, spirituality and music therapy for prisoners, featuring Verdine White, Co-founder of Earth, Wind and Fire, along with the movies and spiritual documentaries exclusively produced by Michel Pascal.  

MIND DIVE presents all the songs, composed and sung by Michel Pascal,  along with those written by Ena Love, which are arranged, produced and performed by Myron McKinley the Music director of Earth Wind and Fire."

* FAQ

- How do I put files into GPlayer? 
To add files to your GPlayer app, you have to go to iTunes, and select the “Apps” tab. At the bottom of this page, there’s a “File sharing” section – just select GPlayer in the list, and add files from there. Note that you don’t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the “File sharing” tab, and they’ll be uploaded immediately. You can even use a friend’s iTunes to add videos to your own iPhone. Also, adding files over WiFi is supported. Indeed, WiFi is significantly slower than USB, and ruins the battery life.

- What kind of streams does GPlayer play? 
GPlayer is able to play RTSP and MMS streams. For now those can’t be added to the media library, but you can click an RTSP or MMS url in Safari or Mail for example.
If you want to use GPlayer to open HTTP/FTP streaming, add ""gplayer:"" prefix in the URL.

- I want to explicitely open an attachment with GPlayer? 
If you want to watch an attachment in GPlayer(from Mail for example), just do a long press on the attachment. A menu will pop-up that will let you pick GPlayer as a player.

- iTunes won’t let me install GPlayer on my iPhone or iPod Touch? 
Unfortunately, we had to drop support for older iOS devices such as the iPhone 3G or the first two versions of iPods. Indeed, after some testing, we realized those weren’t fast enough to provide a pleasant experience.

- Why HD MKV movies don’t play smoothly? 
Currently, only iPad 2 supports 720p MKV file, that’s to be expected. The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.

- The audio and the video is not in sync? 
That is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable ""Skip Frame"" in the settings page.

- Is there a TV-out support? 
Yep, supports iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.

1486247462;Easy VOA Learning English;"Easy VOA Learning English is VOA’s multimedia source of news and information for millions of English learners worldwide.

There are 3 levels in this app:

- Beginning Level:

Ask a Teacher is a new program where learners can ask questions and teachers answer them. News Words is a short video explaining a word or term used in news stories.

- Intermediate Level

Some language teaching methods are dull and disconnected from real life. People soon forget what they learn, or focus on words and phrases without context. Learners absorb American English through content drawn from U.S. and world news, Health and Lifestyle, Science and Technology, Arts and Culture, and other topics. Learners can build vocabulary, strengthen speaking skills and improve the ability to communicate for work, school and everyday life.

Audio programs and captioned videos - English in A Minute, English @ the Movies, Everyday Grammar TV and Learning English TV - are written using vocabulary at the upper-beginner and intermediate level. The programs are read one-third slower than normal English speed.

- Advanced Level

Advanced English learners can read classic literature with American Stories, learn idioms and expressions with Words and Their Stories, study with Everyday Grammar, and follow innovations and trends in Education in the U.S. and around the world.

965037211;Hue Camera for Philips Hue;"""It is most impressive when working with live video, as it does a good job of keeping up with changing action happening on screen"" - TechCrunch.com

Hue Camera creates an Ambilight-like effect using your Philips Hue lights and your device's built-in camera. The custom build algorithm of Hue Camera continuously analyses all individual pixels and takes hue, saturation, luminance, occurrence and many more factors into consideration to determine which specific colour is the most contributing to the overall ambiance. Your house will for example turn green when watching movies in the forest and turn blue for underwater scenes.

Because Hue Camera uses the built-in camera, it's not limited to a specific device and can be used for content on televisions, Apple TV, gaming consoles, BluRay/DVD players and even things off-screen like photos and paintings. Although Hue Camera was designed to work within a wide range of situations, you can change the speed of colour transitions and the intensity of the colour to your liking."

1249388425;LG TV Screen Mirroring + Cast;"Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any LG Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your LG TV.

This works on any LG Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. 

In using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

How the app works:

1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your LG TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.

2. Launch the Mirror for LG TV app. It will start looking for your LG TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model LG TV, the TV might ask you to ""allow"" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.

3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.

4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.

5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for LG TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.

Limitations and known issues:

DRM

Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.

There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:

Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.

About Screen Recording and Privacy

Even though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.

You can purchase the Mirror for LG TV Pro Version through an in app purchase.

The Pro Version has the following features:
1. Adds audio to the screen mirroring
2. Provides for free lifetime updates of the app
3. Gives the option to choose higher screen resolutions, like 720p and 1080p

Meld je aan voor tv via Ziggo GO met je Mijn Ziggo account. Download de app van Ziggo GO op je smartphone of tablet en log in. Gelukt? Je kijkt direct tv. Live. Terugkijken? Of zin in iets anders: check de tv-gids in de app. Zo heb je alles bij de hand. Tv-kijken op je laptop kan natuurlijk ook: zet ziggogo.tv in je browser en daar ga je. Voortaan kijk je tv gewoon waar je bent, overal binnen de Europese Unie.

Naast een handige tv-gids, live tv, terugkijken via Ziggo Replay en kijken naar het aanbod in Movies & Series (XL) kan je nog meer met Ziggo GO:

- Maak je favoriete zenderlijst aan en bepaal zelf de volgorde.
- Stel een herinnering in en mis je favoriete programma nooit meer.
- Maak je eigen speellijst aan met je favoriete programma’s, films en series. 

Let op: tv-kijken via 3G of 4G kost veel MB's uit je mobiele databundel. Je mobiele aanbieder kan extra kosten berekenen als je door je databundel heen bent. Kijk daarom bij voorkeur via wifi of WifiSpots. Dat kost je niets extra.

MINIMALE VEREISTEN & VOORWAARDEN
- een iPad, iPhone of iPod Touch met minimaal iOS 12.1
- de Ziggo GO app werkt niet op een apparaat met jailbreak
- de app vereist dat je de juiste tijd hebt ingesteld op je apparaat omdat anders het streamen van video niet werkt. 
- Om te streamen met Chromecast of AirPlay moet je minimal iOS 12.1 of nieuwer op je iPhone of iPad hebben staan. En Apple TV van de 2e generatie of hoger. 

Let op: Gebruik altijd de laatste versie van de Ziggo GO app."

1178030238;Mirror for Philips TV;"Application to mirror the screen of your Mac to any Philips Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your TV. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your TV!

This works on any Philips Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. 

If your Philips TV is running the Android TV operating system, there is also a Android TV app on the Google Play Store that you can install on your Philips TV for even better performance, check it here: http://bit.ly/gpsmirror

In using the app, there will be about a second of latency. So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

- Preferably, connect your TV by LAN cable to your router.
- Use an ""ac""  router. If you don't have one, then an ""n"" router.
- Try not to overload your wifi network by moving big files around while you are mirroring.

How the app works:
First, make sure that your Samsung TV is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. The TV should not be in screen mirroring mode, but just on ""TV"" Mode or any HDMI IN port.
 
After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your TV on the network. It will show your TV when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

1204749466;finessTV Client;"finessTV Client plays the live tv stream of a TV receiver or a selected archive movie.

Clients can easily and privately connect to the server from outside the local WiFi and friends can be invited to share television and archived movies.


As a requirement, the ""finessTV Server"" has to be started on the Mac. The client can access the server within the local network or outside the local network (after entering a server address and port in the preferences).

After the successful connection, the available channels are displayed on the left and the current live tv stream is displayed on the right.

Selecting a channel will change the channel in the TV receiver and, as soon as the new stream data is available, the live stream will be switched.

Because multiple clients can be connected to the server, the channel is also switched if the channel is switched on another client.

Due to the system requirements, the live stream is delayed (ca.10-15 seconds) and the switch takes several seconds (ca. 20).

Furthermore the archive can be selected to watch a recorded movie on a client. Other clients can continue to watch the live stream or select and watch an archive movie as well.

finessTV supports EPG based on a web page url (see Preferences; only available on iPad), broadcast data or XMLTV setup in the server.

434371426;WI Orchestra™;"***** TOP #5 MOST DOWNLOADED MUSIC APP IN OVER 25 COUNTRIES *****

WI Orchestra is a full orchestral library and composition tool for iPhone and iPad. 

You can now create and record your own orchestral music on the iPhone, layer by layer, using the instruments and built-in recording features of WI Orchestra. Choose between a full range of orchestral strings, brasswinds, woodwinds, saxophones and percussion. 

When starting WI Orchestra for the first time, press the ""play"" button to listen to the included demo song, which was made with the WI Orchestra app in only a few hours! 

WI Orchestra features a velocity sensitive keyboard (requires iOS 4.0 or higher) allowing you to play different dynamics by touching the keyboard harder of softer. The simplest way to use WI Orchestra is to choose one of the dynamics presets (pp, p, mp, mf, f or ff) and play only using the keyboard. 

You can work on as many as 98 different projects at a time, and export your songs to your computer, as *.wav files, via the ""Apps"" tab in iTunes (requires iOS 4.0 or higher). iOS devices with less than 256 MB RAM are capable of 1 minute length projects (iPhone 3GS and earlier) while iPhone 4 and iPads are capable of 5 minute length projects. 

For those who are unfamiliar with orchestral music, each instrument in WI Orchestral comes with a picture and description of the instrument.

For the brave, you can also choose to use the microphone as a breath controller!

WI Orchestra is a universal iOS app, with a native full-screen iPad version and beautiful high-resolution graphics on iPhone 4 retina displays. 

Five amazing instruments from the different sections of the orchestra are included for free, Violins, Trumpet, Flute, Tenor Saxophone and Timpani! 

TIP: For first-time users on iPhone/iPod Touch, in order to access the keyboard you need to press the ""Play!"" button!

1107644799;Mirror for Samsung TV;"Application to mirror the screen of your Mac to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can also stream individual video files from your Mac to your TV. Also, we included the option to watch one window on your Mac, and another window on your TV!

This works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).

E = 2012
F = 2013
H = 2014
J = 2015
K = 2016
M = 2017
N = 2018
R = 2019
Q = QLED (supported)

For instance:

UE55_E_S8000 = 2012.
UE78_H_U8500L = 2014.

In using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

The quality of your experience will be dependent on the quality of your local network. Some tips to enhance the experience:

- Preferably, connect your TV by LAN cable to your router.
- Use a Wifi ac router. If you don't have one, then an ""n"" router.
- Try not to overload your wifi network by moving big files around while you are mirroring.

How the app works:
First, make sure that your Samsung TV is on the same local network and same subnet as your Mac. The TV should not be in screen mirroring mode, but just on ""TV"" Mode or any HDMI IN port.
 
After launching the app, you will see the app icon appearing in the top bar of your Mac and the app will look for your TV on the network. It will show your TV when it has found it. Now, you have two options:

Mirror your Mac Screen:
Use this option to put the screen of your Mac on TV. In source, you can select which screen (or attached monitor) you want to display on TV. If you are running multiple applications on your Mac, you can also select which application window you want to see on TV.

Enable Sound: check this to hear the sound of your Mac coming from the TV. You will need the additional (free) audio driver, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/MirrorAudio

Play Video File:
Use this option if you have a video file on your Mac and you want to play just the file on TV. Drop it in the box and it will play on TV.

Settings (the icon in the bottom right of the app): click here to request support from our 24/7 support staff. They usually respond within 2 hours on any query that you might have. If your question is technical, please also include the diagnostics information.

Limitations: Apple has HDCP DRM protection for playing iTunes movies. This means that screen mirroring is not possible when watching movies from iTunes.

When you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!

Please give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv"

1249399133;Roku Screen Mirroring + Cast;"Application to mirror the screen and audio of your iPhone or iPad to your Roku. This can be any Roku Streaming Player, Roku Stick or Roku TV (from Hisense, TCL, Insignia, JVC, RCA, Westinghouse, Philips, Sanyo, Hitachi, Magnavox, Element, Onn and Sharp)! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Roku.

In using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. 

However, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!

How the app works:

1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Roku. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.

2. Launch the Mirror for Roku app. It will start looking for your Roku(s) on your local network. When a Roku Player, Stick or TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, your Roku will go to the Mirror for Roku install page. Select Add Channel to add the Mirror for Roku receiver on your Roku.

3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your Roku is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.

4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the Roku that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.

5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Roku app and click on Stop Mirroring.

Limitations and known issues:

DRM

Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.

There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:

Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.

You can purchase the Mirror for Roku Pro Version through an in app purchase.

The Pro Version has the following features:
1. Adds audio to the screen mirroring
2. Provides for free lifetime updates of the app
3. Gives the option to choose higher screen resolutions, like 720p and 1080p

* Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.
* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.

- NO user submitted questions. 
- NO multiple choice. 
- NO lame questions. 

We love trivia! But we've found most trivia games out there aren't that fun: awkward and sometimes incorrect user submitted questions, multiple choice makes questions too easy or a 25% chance guess, and good quality questions are hard to find. We've decided to do our own Trivia Game right. 

QUESTIONS - are carefully researched so people really interested in the subjects will have fun knowing the answers. 

INPUT METHOD - We don't like multiple choice, but typing from scratch creates a lot of ambiguity and spelling problems. We strive for the perfect balance -- we give you hangman style slots and we give you 20 letters to spell it out. 

Free LITE VERSION has access to half the EASY and MEDIUM questions, and no HARD questions. Upgrade to FULL VERSION to access all questions. Upgrading will also remove all ads and increases Level Up Hints bonuses by x4.

408364844;The Circus Fire;"Joh Sasaki, winner of the 2010 Naoki Award, releases an unpublished poem as an e-book for the iPad.
Sasaki received the142nd Naoki Award in January 2010, for his novel Silent Devastation (Haikyo-ni-kou). He is well-known for his police stories and historical novels. He has been creating these in Hokkaido, where he was born. The Circus Fire is his only poem for children. Written a few years ago, it had not been published. Miho Sasaki, an illustrator who is active in Hokkaido, has illustrated this poem, and La Zone, a Hokkaido-based bal-musette band has provided original music. The poem was convented to iPad format and released from Hokkaido to the world.

[Message from the author]
The Circus Fire was inspired by a personal experience. I'm sure that many people from Sapporo who are older than I am remember the fire. It happened in June 1959. The circus caught fire during the Sapporo Festival. I was right outside the burning tent, and I saw it all. After writing the poem, I thought it might be more for adults than for kids. I'm delighted it's become an attractive picture book for the iPad. It's much greater than I could ever have expected. I'm looking forward to responses from the every corner of the world.

Have you ever had a time when you start reading an article or talking to some friends about something and when you finally look up, hours have flown by? Do you have one hobby, book, or TV show that brightens your day? Then Vingle is the place for you.

Think back to a time when you had a joke or a thought that was so funny that you had to share it with someone. You go to your close friends, but they never watched that Anime or aren't into that book series. They don't get it.  It's a bummer to not be able to fully geek out on something you love. 

In instances like this, we often censor ourselves on social media in order to maintain a certain image or just to not annoy our family and friends that don't have the same hobbies. On Vingle, though, there is no need to limit how many times you post about your stamp collection, or favorite boy band.  Your posts will go directly to a community of people who get you, who want to talk about that as much as you do!

We believe that being ourselves and sharing what we truly love is the best way to relieve stress and simply be happier.  That uplifting feeling from finding someone who understands you, is priceless and invaluable to a joyful life.  It is our passion at Vingle to create that space for people to feel that sense of belonging.

Whether you're looking for tips for your upcoming Japan trip from fellow Studio Ghibli fans, book suggestions from murder mystery addicts, or you just want to chat, share, and learn about your hobby or passion, Vingle is the community for you.

Join communities based on your Interests, follow people who love what you love, and share anything from a simple question to a long post with videos and photos.  You can even create your own communities if you want to get more specific about your interest! Communities can be anything from general 'Movies' to something as specific as 'Quentin Tarantino's Left Eyebrow' if you're really that interested in it ;) You're in control!

So stop hiding your passions and enjoying your hobbies alone.  Geek out on Vingle, where people love what you love.  The only question remaining is:

""What are you into?"""

"1079109087";"PANDAS / PANS Journal";"PANDAS / PANS JOURNAL is the first iOS app to allow parents to record symptoms and notes on a daily basis to diagnose and treat children with PANDAS / PANS.

What are PANDAS and PANS?

Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) are characterized by a debilitating onset of intense anxiety and OCD in children.

In addition, children with PANDAS / PANS may experience tics and symptoms of depression, irritability, anxiety, and have difficulty with schoolwork. The cause of PANS is unknown in most cases but is thought to be triggered by infections, metabolic disturbances, and other inflammatory autoimmune reactions.

Why PANDAS / PANS Journal?

1. JOURNAL to record symptoms - For every child afflicted by this horrible condition, an entire family's life is turned upside down. Parents wake up every morning, wondering if it was all a dream, only to realize they are living the nightmare. PANDAS / PANS Journal is a place to record the daily behaviors, changes and medications of children with this condition to better-understand how to treat them.

2. COMMUNICATION tool between you and a doctor - We found that doctor's appointments can be overwhelming. It was a struggle to remember all that had happened since the last appointment and we didn't want to miss communicating any important details. PANDAS / PANS Journal provides an organized way to share data with the care providers of your choice.

3. GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS and rating scales - As you enter data our system will help you see the subtle interplay between symptoms and treatment of your child, empowering you with the insight of what is working and what is not. 

4. CONTRIBUTION of data leading to medical breakthroughs - Researchers need data to make breakthroughs. You can choose to share your data to help with this process or keep it confidential.

Parents who have witnessed a child transform from happy and healthy to an inconsolable shell of their former self know the agony induced by this debilitating condition.

A child affected by PANDAS/PANS exhibits life-changing symptoms such as OCD, severe restrictive eating, oppositional defiance, anxiety, tics, personality changes, decline in math and handwriting abilities, sensory sensitivities, and the list goes on.

When PANDAS / PANS affected our lives personally, we found ourselves overwhelmed with feelings of isolation, helplessness, fear and grief over losing the person that our child once was. When we could muster up the energy after a long day of outbursts, oppositional defiance, and repetitive OCD questions, we tried to jot down notes for our next doctors' appointments. These dark days blended together, making it difficult to attend medical appointments with a clear and organized mind, prepared to ask the right questions and accurately recount the previous weeks and months.  

As pioneers in the App Store health arena, we made it our mission to work on this PANDAS / PANS app with the goal to improve the management and healing process for the caregivers of children with this condition. 

To support this app and the cause, we offer an optional auto-renewing subscription that removes all ads.
– Under the sponsor tab you can either select 1 month (at $9.99 / month) or 12 month (at $6.92/ month ) auto-renewing subscriptions.
– Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period
– Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase
– Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal
– Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase
– Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable"

"1479654994";"Health Diary App";"There is a fairly large body of applied social research in the health field which have used structured diaries, in which informants are invited to ‘log’ items from a list of health action they have undertaken, rather than open diaries. In particular, health diaries have been argued to present the optimum way of investigating helpseeking for episodes of illness for reasons which resonate with the discussion of the autobiographical literature above - namely the ability to capture events close to when they unfold and the potential to trace events over continuous time. The literature on both qualitative and quantitative methods has highlighted the value of diaries in recording routine or everyday processes. Therefore there is a need for prospective data to track events as closely as possible to when they occur.

Our hunting app is a personal journal that can be used year-round while hunting or scouting for any type of game. TrophyTracks can be used to track locations, observations, harvests, field notes, and pictures while hunting, scouting, or checking trail cameras. Hunters can also add past hunts, observations, or harvests to complete your hunting journal.

The TrophyTracks hunting journal provides real-time location, sunrise, sunset, weather attributes, and moon phase while also saving the temperature, wind speed, wind direction, pressure, humidity, and location for each entry you log. Over time, by logging hunting journals, a hunter can better understand how game moves depending on the time of the year and weather conditions. Hunters can use past journals and locations to understand where the most observations and harvests happened, unlocking the power of TrophyTracks to put you in the right spot, at the right time.

Use TrophyTracks to keep track of trail camera locations and add your best trail cam photos. Adding photos to TrophyTracks automatically tags the weather information and saves it to your journal. The trail cam feature will allow you to better understand when and where game are moving and how those movements relate to weather patterns.

The TrophyRoom was added so hunters can save and organize all their trail cam images and other relevant hunting images. Hunters can easily find and retrieve their best trail cam images and any other pictures or harvest records directly in the hunting app.

Our free hunting journal allows you to create journal entries for each location you hunt or scout and view basic statistics for those locations. Hunters can look back at past entries to understand how the weather and wind affected their observations while also being able to edit those past entries.

For advanced statistics and to get a complete understanding of game movement and predictions, the TrophyTracks PRO version provides hunters with the ability to see the observations made by time of day, temperature, and wind direction. Hunters can look at current conditions and forecasted weather data to align the perfect conditions to hunt your best locations. In addition, TrophyTracks PRO allows you to save more than 25 trail cam images or any hunting photos to your journals.

Pensive is a simple tool to bring more awareness and attention to your day-to-day life. 3 types of entries to manage your day:

Start your day - Take a few moments to consider your mood & pick an affirmation or intention before you start the day. This creates a good foundation to manifest your day the way you want it.


Journal entry - Keep track of what you do daily. Add photos & write about your day for a more detailed journal entry. By journaling in snippets, you bring attention to your day’s activity and take the pressure out of writing a large entry at the end of the day.


End your day - Once you’re done with the day, lay it to rest. Being grateful for the little things, or doing a guided meditation. By doing some mental housekeeping regularly, you can avoid a buildup of negativity and unexpressed feelings.



PENSIVE FEATURES
- Mood tracking
- Fun emoji stickers for each entry
- Daily affirmations
- Activity tracking
- Journal writing
- Photo journal
- Writing Prompts
- Gratitude diary
- Guided meditations
- Unique themes with color scheme
- Private journal with authentication lock
- Back up journal to Google Drive


HOW TO USE PENSIVE
For a start, every entry allows you to rate your current mood out of 10. If you’d like to, you may use Pensive as a mood tracker to simply keep track of how you’re feeling throughout the day.

If you’d like to go more in-depth with managing your day-to-day life, you can explore the full range of Pensive. You can Start your day with an affirmation or intention for the day. Setting your intention or affirmation when you start the day empowers you to choose the direction you want your day to go in.



Keep track of your moods and activities throughout the day. You may journal in small snippets or make them as elaborate as you like. You’re free to add a title, write a post, log your activities and add photos to every journal entry. Journaling in small snippets allows you to stay aware of how you use your time daily, and how it makes you feel. This is a good practice to bring more attention to your day-to-day life. It also takes the pressure off writing a large entry at the end of the day.


Once you're done with your day, you can End your day with a little bit of reflection. You may write about parts of your day for which you were grateful and parts of it you can improve upon. Use the guided meditation track to put your day behind you so that you can start the next day fresh!

By segmenting your day as such, you can slowly take charge of your life and how you experience it. Make every day work for you, by simply paying a little more attention to how you feel and what you’re up to daily.

Then when your children grown up then you’re able to send them a gift of all of the memories that were collected throughout the years.

When your child grows up then you’re even able to gift these memories to them that you’ve collected of them throughout their years of growing up in front of your eyes.

If you’re having a great day today with them because they took their first steps, or anything else, you can document the emotions and thoughts here. If you’re having a rough day with them you can also document that here. You can utilize the calendar function to be able to sort through the memories and diary entries.

*2017 Congressional App Challenge Winner*
“Highly innovative and will help users daily as they document their thoughts and emotions”
- Rep. Anna G. Eshoo, CA-18

Though we all know keeping a journal is beneficial (to your health, mindset, communication skills, etc.), most of us don't set aside the time to write lengthy paragraphs. Mere, on the other hand, takes less than 5 minutes of your day.

Most journal apps give you a blank screen and tell you to start writing. Not Mere. Mere is different. It asks three specific questions each day: the first two stay the same, while the third varies - it might ask, “What problems did you solve today?” or “What new thing did you learn today?”

Features:
* Map: Tag locations and see them appear on the map tab.
* Photos: Add photos to your daily entry, and view them later in the photos tab.
* Stats: View information such as your average mood and how many entries, photos, and locations you’ve entered.
* Calendar: Browse previous entries and feel nostalgic."

- Create any number of species/varieties, which can then be assigned to the plants. In the app are no species/varieties predefined. For each definition an Internet link and a text description can be stored.

- Create any number of own plants/trees. This can be done directly on the visual map, among other things very easy, for example, if you walk through your orchard. The place can be corrected afterwards by moving the pins with the finger. Each plant can be given an ""birthday"" and an individual name.

- Maintain a diary for each plant. For each plant as many diary entries can be created. Each entry can have a date, a photo (taken with the camera or selected from the library) and a text description. Follow the development of your trees: When was planted, when was cut, how did the cut, as they harvested when fertilized, and so on.

- To save space in the database the photo compression and resolution can be defined. All photos taken with the app can be exported later to the library.

- The database can be automatically backed up to iCloud. It can be exported/imported also to/from other storage places (for instance, DropBox). This makes it possible to use the same data on multiple devices."

- Fill the map with a lot of pins - Every memory that has attached a location will be automatically shown on the map.

- Automatically count the number of cities and countries visited - By adding the location to a memory the app will automatically keep track of how many cities and how many countries you have visited and you can see all the memories from a certain country or city. By doing this you can forget about manually counting how many countries you have visited

- Count the days since you two are a couple - The first thing that you will see after creating an account is the calendar picker that lets you select the day since you two are a couple. It is also planned that in the next version the couples will be able to create countdowns for important events from their lives. For example a countdown to see how many days are left until the next road trip;

- Personalize the app with your own avatar - Each person can upload their own profile photo for a better experience in the app and to feel more “like home”.

This app keeps all your notes on display in a large, friendly format, in chronological order.

• Elegant and simple layout of notes by date.
• Summary view for a quick overview.
• Detail view to browse all notes at once.
• Edit or delete notes quickly from any screen.

"371886793";"Chronicle - A Personal Journal / Writing Diary";"Take note of life with Chronicle, a simple journaling app that offers more than bound sheets without overcomplicating the writing experience. 

Focused writing. Multiple photos per entry that you can move, resize, rotate - your words flow around them. A recent New York Magazine article cites research showing people experienced improvement in ""physical and mental well-being. They were happier, less depressed and less anxious"" after writing about emotional or stressful events for a few days.

Start writing more, today. Reliable storage, autosave, and passcode lock protect your words; share or read them on your computer with PDF, text, and email export. You can also create backups and save them to other apps such as Dropbox, Drive, and Evernote.

Your journal will never run out of pages, but you can manage different topics or years in separate journals with the notebooks add-on.

Take a break from social networks. Write comfortably knowing you can find anything you wrote with built-in search. Search results include relevant snippets of text so you can easily find the exact entry you’re looking for.

According to a Harvard Business School paper, taking 15 minutes to reflect on your work at end of the workday can boost job performance (the study's journaling group performed 22.8% better on a test than the control group that simply continued working).

Start keeping a journal or diary. Organize chapters for a novel. Jot down notes and ideas. You can always export what you’ve written for safekeeping.

"1540292755";"Mood Connect: Self-Care Diary";"Mood Connect - Wouldn't you like to keep a micro diary in just 5 seconds without writing a single word?

Choose the date. Choose your daily mood. Then select and save quality sleep, eating healthy, hygiene, hobbies, and socializing. Keeping a micro diary is that easy! 

- Review your mood history.
- Statistics of your top moods, top emotions, top activities, activities that bring you down, and activities that cheer you up
- Identify the areas where you are open to improvement.
- Examine your diary in privacy.

Question: What are five good reasons to track your mood?

In a nutshell, the reason for tracking your mood is to learn more about yourself and achieve better health.

1. Triggers and warning signs. By using a mood diary you can monitor the patterns in your life and identify negative influences (or “triggers”) that you need to avoid, and early warning signs that your health is deteriorating.

2. Wellness strategies. A mood diary can help you to find the small things, as well as the big, that help you to stay well. It can show you the impact of the positive strategies that you adopt on your well-being.

3. Planning for health. Optimism is a case in point. It is designed for a person to bring together an understanding of their triggers, early warning signs or symptoms, and wellness strategies. It gives them a better understanding of their health and helps them to develop a plan for remaining well. That is the key. The purpose of a mood diary should be to plan for wellness, not just keep a record of illness.

4. Actively participate. Rather than be a passive recipient of treatment, or just seek treatment in reaction to a new episode, a mood diary can help you to have more involvement in your health and a sense of control. In general, people achieve better health outcomes when they educate themselves and are proactive about their health.

5. A health professional’s dream. By keeping a mood diary you can provide your health professional with a precise, detailed history. It removes the problem of memory recall and gives an accurate picture of what has been happening. It gets to the bottom of what is or isn’t working, which helps them to give more relevant, appropriate advice and treatment.

Mood Connect for you!

Mahalo is your guide to daily gratitude practice. All over the world, people who keep a gratitude journal or practice gratitude experience improved stress relief, anxiety relief, self-love, self-care, more motivation and improved mindfulness.

Mahalo is the easiest way to practice gratitude and make it a habit that you will do every single day. Each day a new gratitude practice will be available. When you open the app the first thing you will see is the newest practice for you to start. The practices are meant to take between two and ten minutes, they are meant to be short in part because practicing gratitude should impact the rest of your day outside of the time spent practicing in the app. After you have completed your daily practice the next practice will not be available until the following day. We suggest that you add reminders so it is easier to build the habit of practicing gratitude.
 
A gratitude diary is a sacred place where you can open up to yourself and explore your own thoughts and feelings. That means privacy is important: Any things that you write in a Mahalo practice is only for your eyes and is not available to anyone else.

Mahalo means thank you. Thank you for the life I live. Thank you for the good times and the bad. Thank you to myself for never giving up. Thank you.

"1441967025";"Fangstjournalen";"Hold styr på fisketurene og del data med videnskaben:

Denne applikation er et værktøj for lystfiskeren, der gerne vil have styr på og overblik over sine fangster og fisketure og samtidig gerne vil hjælpe med at passe på vores fiskebestande. Når du samler dine fisketure i Fangstjournalen, bidrager du med vigtige data til DTU Aquas forskning og arbejde med at forbedre forholdene for fiskebestandene i Danmark til glæde for alle lystfiskere. Appen er udviklet af DTU Aqua ved Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, som rådgiver blandt andet ministerier, fiskeriforeninger, kommuner og privatpersoner om fisk og fiskeri.

Med Fangstjournalen kan du nemt registrere, hvor du fisker, hvor længe du fisker, og hvad du har fanget – enten i forbindelse med fisketuren, eller når du er kommet hjem.

Fangstjournalen – en fordel for dig:

Fangstjournalen gør det nemt for dig at holde styr på dine fangster og fisketure.

• Få overblik over, hvad du har fanget, hvornår og hvor.
• Se dine rekorder og fangstgennemsnit for forskellige arter og sammenlign med andre
• Få data om vejr og vind tilknyttet dine fisketure
• Se fangststatistik for forskellige fiskevande
• Se hvor der er fredningsbælter
• Se mindstemål og fredningsperioder
• Hjælp din lystfiskerforening med at skabe endnu bedre fiskeri
• Få nem adgang til masser af viden og nyheder om fiskeri og fiskebiologi 

Fangstjournalen – en fordel for fiskebestandene:

Når du bruger Fangstjournalen, gør du en forskel for fiskebestandene. Oplysningerne fra Fangstjournalen indgår i DTU Aquas forskning, overvågning og pleje af de danske fiskebestande. Fangstjournalen kan gøre forskerne klogere på, hvordan fiskebestande bliver påvirket, f.eks. når der sker ændringer i klima, levesteder, mængden af rovdyr, fiskeriet, fiskeriregler, udbrud af fiskesygdomme, indvandring af fremmede fiskearter, forurening og meget andet.

Alle fangster og fisketure er som udgangspunkt anonymiserede, og dit navn bliver ikke nævnt. Når der bliver lavet statistik på data, sker det i sammenhæng med andre data, så man kan ikke genkende den enkelte lystfisker. Hvis man gerne vil genkendes, kan man lave sin fangst til en offentlig fangst – så kommer man på forsiden af appen. Man kan også vælge at gøre sine fangster og fisketure hemmelige. Så indgår de ikke i den statistik, som vises på Fangstjournalen, men kan stadig blive anvendt af forskerne.

Applikationen fungerer i sammenhæng med fangstjournalen.dtu.dk

"1571288163";"Dream Journal & Lucid Dreaming";"Delve into the world of lucid dreaming, track your sleep, and improve your mental health through the aid of the dream journal app.
Dreams tend to be sneaky and easy to forget; using our app to keep track of your dreams helps you recall your dreams more vividly. Through consistency, lucid dreaming would become much more attainable.

Lucid dreaming is the act of remaining self-aware during a dream; who wouldn’t want that! It allows you to create a personalized dream world; with practice, your dream state becomes a canvas for creating a magical dreamland.

BEGIN BY
- Learning about lucid dreams through the app
- Write down your dreams in the journal as soon as you wake up
- Continue to read and reread your written dreams
- Set a lucid dream goal
- Have a plan and stick to it
- Start practicing the steps to achieve lucid dreaming

Our app aids you in achieving these goals by allowing you to create an account where you can keep track of your dreams through a dream diary. Our app sends notifications to remind you to write down your dream once you wake up; that way, you’ll be able to keep track and have better chances at lucid dreaming.

With our app, you’ll be able to set goals and keep up with them through the reality check function, which helps you practice sleep awareness. The reality check function requires you to perform simple tasks throughout the day that help you differentiate between sleep and waking. These tasks may include counting your fingers, reading something, breathing through your nose, or checking the time. These simple tasks help you attain self-awareness during dreams.

We also offer practice steps to keep you on track. Our dream Journal app has a ‘connect to social network’ function that lets you store your progress. It aids and keeps track of your progress by asking a series of short questions. We also offer a safe option to lock your dream diary within the journal to keep unwanted eyes out. After getting the Dream Journal and Lucid Dreaming app and signing up, you’ll have access to step by step explanation of every category to avoid confusion.

The dream journal helps with more than lucid dreaming; it promotes a stronger dream memory, improves your mood, increases your dream brightness, and promotes a better sleep pattern. Everyone needs a dream journal, and that includes you!

"6446169590";"My diary - Secret Journal";"We all have feelings and emotions but very often it is really hard to share them with other persons. Even before smartphones many of us use to write in a real diary witch many times was just a notepad in which we were writing down everything that we felt without worrying that we will be judged. Many of us, if not all, made our diary a secret diary just to be sure that no one reads it. Either is was a love diary or just a daily diary we loved it and share every emotion and thought. First crush, fight with your parents, first heartbreak, the time when you really felt in love ... all these moments were always shared with your dear diary.

Now, in our modern times, the simple old trusty journal notepad had become a application on our mobile device which allows us to do more in less time and very often in a more secure way.
With that in mind we though to put our ideas, regarding to what WE believe a journal should be, in making a simple, intuitive and comprehensive diary application that will be your partner who listens but doesn't share anything that you think and feel.

To make it perfect for how we would like it to be we have included the following cool features:

A DIARY THAT IS SIMPLE, INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE - simplicity is the first thing in our minds

 - easy and intuitive navigation between entries
 - calendar functionality that allows to navigate and filter trough your journal
 - possibility to add images on each entry
 - image gallery - all your intimate journal moments in one place
 - PDF export functionality for when you want to print or share your entries
 - search functionality
 - multiple settings that are easy to understand and use
 - overview on all log entries
 - simple design which make it easy to use
 - FREE diary will all functionality available 

A SECRET DIARY NEEDS TO BE SAFE AND SECURED

 - password protected - what used to be a physical journal with lock you now have a diary with password
 - auto lock functionality in case someone looks at your phone when your are not expecting
 - backup and restore functionality - whenever your need to change your phone or in case you lose it
 - complete reset and delete functionality - just in case you need to erase everything

STYLE & CUSTOMISATION - Make it feel like ""MY diary""

 - emoji / emoticons stickers - share how you feel - can be used as a ""Mood Diary""
 - multiple color styles - you need to make it personal and intimate
 - multiple fonts styles and font sizes

WORD CLOUD - Visualise your life, emotions and feelings in one place

 - a place where most used words in your diary are displayed in one place in a beautiful way
 - allows you to filter your entries based on your most used words 


Sentiments and feelings are part of our life and sharing them with someone or even for ourselves in a simple diary can make our life more enjoyable and pleasant. Reading what we've wrote in the past can help us understand who we are and what moments have defined our life. In a complex and always in a hurry world, writing down your precious moments in a intimate way in a intimate journal will always help you embrace the world in a beautiful and healthy way.

We hope you will find this application useful and will grow to love to use it."

REMEMBER ALL THE PLACES YOU VISITED
Do you like to look back on your travel and see all those places you have been to? Do you like to see them on a map to get a better sense of how far you have been? This is what I love to do when traveling, this why I created Swan. And because your phone’s battery is just important as mine, it was all done using battery efficient technologies that preserve your phone and will let you take all those pictures without draining your energy.
And for those moments when the cellular network is letting you down abroad, no worries, Swan will store it locally and sync it once you’re back online.

YOUR TRAVEL JOURNAL
If you’re like me, at the end of the day, you may enjoy writing down your experiences during your travel so that you can even better remember the places and the feelings when you were there. And because there’s nothing harder than heading back home and leaving behind those new friends, those relatives living far away, being able to go back in time and read again about those moments together makes you relive the magic.

BASECAMPS
The places you love can now become your Base camps. Each time you log a new visit nearby, it will automatically associated with it. Wherever you are, your favorite places are never too far. Always see where and how far they are.

SYNC ACROSS DEVICES
Do you have different phones that you use? Swan will use the magic of iCloud and iCloud Drive to sync everything, seamlessly and automatically across them. Regardless of which one you use, you always have your companion in your pocket.
Do you like to view all of this in some other application? You can export it all in text, CSV or markdown, so you can make the most out of it.

YOUR TRIPS, YOUR LIFE, YOUR DATA.
From the very beginning and until the final stages, the development of Swan was made with the same clear goal in mind: what is generated within the app, belongs to their users. All you do in Swan, you are the only one capable of viewing it.
The experience is ad-free, there are no analytics and no third-party libraries leaking anything outside your phone or your iCloud account.

If you would like to support the app development, you can even use a built-in tip jar to show your love and help support the app moving forward.

So go out, travel the world, enjoy your time spent away while Swan remembers every step of the way."

"6446241298";"Daily Stoic Journal - 365 Days";"Journaling is one of the most essential exercises in Stoic philosophy. Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius all praised the benefits of journaling. In Stoicism the daily practice is the philosophy.

Therefore journaling is Stoicism. It’s almost impossible to have one without the other.

Each day presents a question to focus on in your morning preparations or evening review. Whether you need help with bad habits like complaining, procrastination, or a hot temper, or are looking to get stronger, wiser and braver, this journal is a tool to get you there.

This journal is a place to focus your attention (prosoche) and prac- tice (melete) as you try to remember and apply what you are learning on the path to progress (prokope). When you pursue the Stoic disci- plines presented in this journal, each morning you will ask, as the great modern Stoic Pierre Hadot put it, ""What principles will guide and inspire my actions?"" And each evening you will examine where you fell short of those principles, as well as where you have made progress. You can begin on any calendar date you choose and proceed.


The Roman Stoics focused not on words, but action. As Seneca memorably put it, ""Philosophy teaches us how to act, not how to talk."" This bias toward improving our actions on a daily basis was something Epictetus made central to his teaching, summarized in his warning ""not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training.""

We have not written a set of commandments or a step-by-step sys- tem that must be adhered to unthinkingly (if you don't want to respond to the prompts, ignore them and write about whatever you feel would be most beneficial.). As Seneca said: ""The ones who pioneered these paths aren't our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone; it hasn't been monopolized.""

Whether you purchase The Daily Stoic Journal App or not, we hope you start journaling in one form or the other. Because it will help you absorb and benefit from stoicism. Any method you prefer will do—it is the process and the practice that counts.
One cannot expect wisdom and self-mastery to simply arrive via epiphany. No, those states are acquired, little by little, practice by practice. The sooner you start, the better.

Now get journaling!"

?Specific examples of how writing has helped me to resolve my problems
1. andrew carnegie

One night. Carnegie was suffering from so many worries that he said, ""I can't help it..."". To get his suffering out, he listed all his worries.

Since I am in so much pain, if I wrote down all my troubles, there must be hundreds or even a thousand...""

With this in mind, he wrote.

When he had written down all of his problems, there were only about 70 of them. Carnegie himself thought there were hundreds or even a thousand, but in reality there were not that many. The 70 or so problems that kept popping into his head and disappearing one after another must have seemed like an infinite number of problems.

Carnegie was free from suffering and lived to be 83 years old."

"1507575828";"Punkt: Journal Private & Safe";"Punkt makes journaling secure, private, easy and fun. But the best of starting a journal now is that you become a happier person.

Here's what makes Punkt special:

* EASY TO USE *
Punkt's focus is on a simple design. Your stories are the most important part of the app, so why should we distract you with any other complicated stuff?

* SECURE AND PRIVATE *
Punkt saves your stories on your local device and in your private iCloud. No one but you can read your stories. You can also protect your stories with Face ID or Touch ID.

* NO LOGIN, NO ADS *
Punkt works without sharing any personally identifiable information. The app is focused on simplicity and privacy. There is no login, no Facebook or Google SDKs, no analytics tracking, no server connection. Everything you do in Punkt is truly private and secure.

* ACCESSIBILITY *
Punkt supports dynamic type, voice-over and voice control. It is designed to be used by everyone. I would welcome any feedback regarding accessibility as this is truly important to me.

* FAIR PRICING *
Punkt is developed just by one developer, therefore I want to make really fair and transparent pricing. If Punkt makes you just a little bit happier, you can help to contribute that the app stays independent and does not need to display ads or require personal data.

---------------

Why did I start building this app? I'm a startup founder myself and I've been through very rough but also hyper exciting and happy times. That's tough by itself, but if one of your loved ones is helpless in pain and suffers then your world stops spinning. Bad times in business and private life made me think about how I can get out of this and become more positive and happier in the end. I've researched a lot and came across the one-sentence journaling technique. Long story short, I've started tracking my days in a Google Sheet. With just a few clicks I could make myself smile again by reading stories about happy days. But also the other way round, looking at rough times makes you appreciate even more what you have in your life. Now I want to help other people with this app.

If you have any feedback you can reach out at https://punktapp.me or gregor@punktapp.me

"1515051363";"mindful - mood journal";"As adults, we're swept with responsibilities and the day to day of life. So much to the point where we often forget to think about how we're feeling.

Maybe you are going through some difficult struggles in your life. Perhaps you catch yourself in feeling a certain way but you don't know how to make sense of it.

This app is a tool in which you can use to analyze your emotions in a constructive way. A fitting analogy might be: If a set of dumbbells are a tool for working out, this would be a work out to develop the muscle you need to analyze your emotions.

Here's how it works:
	- First, select from a set of feelings that you identify with.
	- Secondly, Write about your emotions. How come you've felt this way today? What were you doing? And who were you with?
	- Thirdly, select from a list of needs that you think might help with what you are/were feeling.

Some advice for using this program:
	- Journal daily. At first, it will be hard. But like any habit forming activity, journaling will get easier with time. With time, you will become faster at analyzing your emotions.
	- Focus on just 1 or 2 emotions at a time. You can journal multiple times in the day if you'd like. 

Take a big breath. You can do this. Thank you, and be well.

Som unge fotballspillere var vi opptatt av å føre treningsdagbok, planlegge treninger/kamper, og lage målsettinger. Dette har vi gjort hele livet.

Og slik startet reisen på JUST PLAY. 

Vi håper du liker verktøyet og ønsker deg lykke til i din fotball hverdag.

""I know keeping a household account book is a good way to save money, but it doesn't last long...""
There are many household accounting apps available, but aren't they all a bit cumbersome?

- After launching the application, tap ""Input"" to open the input screen.
- Open the numeric keypad and enter the amount.
- Open the classification screen and make a selection.
- Press the ""Confirm"" button, etc.

Each one is not a big deal. But it can be time-consuming to enter them on the spot, or you may get fed up with entering them all at once later.
Especially for those who are lazy, the key to longevity may be to reduce the time and effort required to enter household accounts, even if only a little.


EASIER, EVEN EASIER, AND ABOVE ALL, EASIER

This app was created with the goal of ""very fast data entry, with little burden and no need to give up.""

The numeric keypad and the categorize & registration buttons are integrated on the initial display screen.

- How much money are you spending every day? Can you continue to spend as you are and stay within your budget?
- How much is your monthly income/expenses?


LET'S DO IT A LITTLE AT A TIME

Our recommendation is to quickly and easily input data on the spot, right after you buy the item. It is not a hassle because it is done in an instant, and there is no need to accumulate too much and get fed up.

""I'm so glad to see someone help people who does DBT. VERY VERY good app.""

Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills are a must, not just for people who have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), but for just about anyone living in this world alongside others.

Are they necessary skills? No. Could anyone benefit from them? Yes.

DBT Skills Groups are booked out weeks and often times months in advance. This means that if you want to get in one, you may be waiting for a long long time, especially if NOW is when you need help.

DBT Skills Groups focus on SKILLS. This means that practicing the skills is much more important than anything else. And luckily, once you learn the skills, you will retain them for the rest of your life!

If you are practicing DBT Skills and want a Diary Card, this app is great for you since it has the following:
• A Calendar to add a Daily Diary Card with 28 DBT skills.
• Descriptions of each skill if you forget
• Examples of each skill
• Premium Users have access to 28 Original Videos for the 28 DBT Skills.
• Statistical information based on 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, or ALL records. That way if you are in a weekly DBT class, you can easily see which skills you have been focusing on, and which you have been missing.
• A Notification reminder that you can set to remind you daily at a specific time to do your DBT Skills Diary Card.
• Beautiful photos and artwork along with a backdrop that changes based on what season we are in (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring).
• Add your own music to the DBT Skills Diary Card to make the experience more enjoyable.
• Full Version Users: You can now send PDF files with your diary card stats + notes via email, or print to your AirPrint printer straight from within the app. Email your therapist/counselor with just a few taps in an easy to read and print format!
• As part of our series of DBT apps, your progress will be saved between apps as well, so you'll have access to all your data no matter which DBT app you are in.
• Earn Messages Stickers as you progress. Send them to friends via a text!
• Unlock more than 1 type of Diary Card so you can continue doing your daily card in a format that fits your lifestyle!
• Want to track extra information? Though DBT classes don't require it, you can add custom tracking data for each Daily Diary Card entry. Of course, since this is optional, you simply need to toggle it on to start tracking right away.
    a) Track Anxiety and Depression using a modified K10 test.
    b) Track Target Behaviors and your response to them.
    c) Track Emotions to see your range and average mood over time.

This is the most enjoyable DBT Skills Diary Card in the App Store! Download it today!

* Note that this app can integrate with the Health App by adding 'Mindful Minutes' when you complete Diary Card entries. This is optional and giving permission will not affect your ability to use this app."

Basic description: The Fecal Incontinence Stool Diary Instrument (FISDI) is a list of patient-reported symptoms for the evaluation of accidental stool leakage also known as fecal Incontinence, and other bowel problems associated with this condition. Fecal incontinence affects 9% of the adult US population and at least 25% of nursing home residents. Fecal incontinence is associated with multiple bowel and stool-related symptoms. Because of the irregular and unpredictable nature of bowel habit, including accidental loss of stool and or gas, and difficulty with either remembering or recalling these symptoms, a prospective assessment of patient-reported bowel and stooling-related symptoms is important, both for use in clinical trials, and for the assessment of patients with fecal incontinence.

Authors:
Neurogut Incorporated (USA)

Objective:
To assess the presence and severity of patient-reported bowel, stool and abdominal symptoms related to accidental stool leakage (fecal incontinence), for use in clinical trials, and assessment of patients with fecal incontinence

Therapeutic Areas:
Gastrointestinal and Digestive System Diseases
Pathological conditions, Signs and Symptoms

Therapeutic indications:
Fecal Incontinence
Dyssynergic defecation
Anorectal and Colorectal diseases
Urinary incontinence
Pelvic floor problems

"1640346123";"The Peak - Intentions Journal";"We all know what it is like to ride on autopilot in life and be stuck in the same old patterns of behavior past their expiration date. Setting intentions can be a great way to exercise your free will to create real change in your day to day life and long term future trajectory. 

The Peak is a simple short form journal designed for quick access wherever you are. A maximum of 10 intentions can be inputted to the primary “front mind” space, while an additional 20 intentions can be stored in the secondary “back mind” space. 
 ? There is one optional “Why?” prompt you are encouraged to submit about each intention you set. Understanding the “why” behind a desired action in life helps you do a gut check as to what the real subconscious motivation is behind a potential future action you may take. Set a weekly reminder about an intention or pin the entry to the top of the feed if you struggle to follow through with it.
-The peak is the most private and secure journal available. All data that is generated can only be viewed by YOU. Everything is stored locally on your device and you can activate FaceID in settings to make sure only you can access your journal. The Peak can be used with no internet connection, so as long as your phone has battery, you are always able to use it. Perfect for use while waiting on lines, sitting in long car rides or flights, etc. Better to journal in the dead time you find in your day than get swept away in endless scrolling on social media."

"718270157";"EatRight - Food Diary / Journal - Simple Daily Nutrition and Fitness Checklist";"Why try it? Keeping a food diary makes you more likely to meet your goals. In one study people that kept track of what they were eating lost TWICE as much weight.

EatRight keeps you focused on what you're eating without forcing you to calculate exact portions and calories. You don't have to search for every little item on your plate. You can spend a little more time enjoying your meals. Just swipe up to start counting.

""I love your app, too many people try to count calories or points & it is too much work. I love how this app works with IOS7 with just swipes I can enter my food."" - Kimberly E.

""I am a dietician and your app is one of the first that I have found that I like. But the only thing that's missing is a 'fats' category."" - Shannon B.

? Designed for iOS 7 and 8 and ready to help you eat better.

Instead, break your meals and snacks into the basic food groups and keep track of portions. It's a simpler way to make sure you're eating a balanced diet.

Some info on common portions is included for each group, and you can also track your fluid intake and the amount of time you exercise every day.

Every day starts with a fresh checklist and a nice background image to inspire you. Scroll up to reveal the buttons for each tracked item - the custom background blurs out of focus. Your totals form a bar graph so it's easy to see how well you're doing.

Previously featured in Bon Appetit magazine!

Note: If you are NOT a parent, Jade is still an awesome app for your everyday journaling. Every user will have a private personal journal.



## WORDS FROM THE APP CREATOR.. ##

My first baby - little Kate - arrived on 13 Aug 2015.

This baby journal app holds the complete journal of Kate's life, starting from her baby years, written collectively by her mother and I.

Our journal is filled with memories such as:

- Our excitment when the pregnancy test kit showed POSITIVE!
- Documenting the big day when Kate is born.
- The warmy, fuzzy feeling when Kate pee-ed all over me..

Not only is the journal meaningful for Kate, but also for us parents. The process of writing down our feelings and thoughts is incredible. Many times, Kate's mother cried (with tears of joy) reading my heartfelt entries.

One day, we will handover the journal to Kate, and she will be able to continue writing on her own. 

And she can reminisce her childhood, forever.

I hope Jade app can provide the same for you and your children.

Have fun journaling (:

--- Words above are from the Creator of Jade ---




## HOW IT WORKS ##

1. Create a journal for your child
2. Write entries for your child
3. Invite your partner to co-write

When you see the doctor he needs information about your headaches to help you but you’re stumped by the questions that need answering.  

• How many headaches you are having?
• How disabling are they?
• What medications are you trying?
• Are your headache preventatives working?
• Are there any triggers you can identify?

When you’re enduring a headache, keeping track of which medications you have taken, foods that might have triggered an attack or charting the time you are disabled is more than you feel up to.  Yet, giving your physician the correct data about your headaches is essential to getting the best headache care.

Luckily, there’s help for you here.  iHeadache has everything you need to track your headache symptoms, disability, triggers and medications in a pain-free way.  With iHeadache, your iPhone becomes a headache diary that’s going to help you and your doctor diagnose and treat your pain.

iHeadache was developed by neurologist, researcher and headache specialist, Dr. Brian D. Loftus.  Who better than a specialist to create the most accurate and important headache tracking tool available?

One of the unique features of iHeadache is that it can tell you the type of headache you’re having by capturing and analyzing real time information.  The app uses criteria specified by the International Headache Society to classify your headache as a migraine, probable migraine, tension headache or unclassified headache.  This application is like having a doctor in your device.

What kind of information does iHeadache track, record and analyze?
• Symptoms 
• Duration and severity
• Disability and impact 
• Medication and usage
• Number of headaches
• Headache triggers

The app is flexible, allowing you to create custom triggers and medications, as well as enter notes about each headache.  iHeadache is the perfect tool for gathering everything you need to know in one convenient place.  You can even generate reports to share with your physician.  Break down the information into 7, 28 or 30 days, or by specific months to show:

• The types of headaches you have
• The number of headaches during a specified period of time
• Medications and dosages
• The length of time you are completely and partially disabled  
• Your MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment Scale) score
• The sum of your headache triggers
• Notes

The information and analysis units in iHeadache have been designed to help you and your doctor design an informed, optimized treatment plan. The report is specifically formatted so your physician can quickly analyze the data about your headaches. You can even choose to export your diary to a CSV file that can be opened in Excel, Numbers or other spreadsheet applications.

"948320402";"Simple Q&A Diary";"This is a journaling app in which instead of writing paragraphs of text, as you would do in any ordinary diary, you answer a bunch of questions on a daily basis. This will save you a lot of time. The list of questions is designed by you, and can be edited at any moment. Simple Q&A Dairy provides the ability to easily monitor any aspect of your life. Say, for instance, you want to lose weight. In this case you can set one of the questions to be ""What did I eat today?"" or ""How many miles did I run today?"" Having to answer the same questions every day will keep you focused on your goals. Entries in the diary can be grouped by question. The entire contents of the diary can be presented as plain text, which you can copy and save outside of the app.

Free app features:
- One list of questions that can consist of no more than two questions.
- You can group the answers.
- You can search through the diary.
- You can present the contents of your diary as a text, then copy that text and save it somewhere.
- You can edit the list of questions at any time. Existing entries won’t be affected by this.
- Entries can be edited and/or deleted.
- You don’t need to answer all the questions at once. Instead, you can create a new entry by answering just one question from your current list of questions and then answer other questions one by one throughout the day by editing that entry. One can easily imagine using this app, for example, in a gym for writing down the results of each exercise (number of sets and repetitions) immediately after that exercise is done.
- There are three types of questions: text answer questions, numerical answer questions and with yes/no answer questions.
- You can view numerical answers on a graph. 
- You can skip answering any question. In this case that question won’t be shown in the resulting entry. However, the entry ‘remembers’ that question, so you can answer it later.
- If you want to launch this app from a launcher, its custom URL scheme is simpleqadiary://
- You can export/import/backup/restore your entries via email.
- All the data is backed up in iCloud

Your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and body weight give a bigger picture of your health. Let’s read about each component in brief.

Blood Glucose Level: The amount of glucose present in your blood is your blood glucose level. Diabetes and high blood sugar level are becoming oversized issues nowadays. Over time, they can harm your body and lead to many unknown problems.

Blood Pressure: Your heart circulates blood in the body to supply it with appropriate oxygen and energy. This circulation of your blood pushes towards the side of the blood vessels. The pressure at which this process takes place is your blood pressure. High blood pressure results in extra stress on the arteries and heart, which can cause heart problems.

Body Weight: Today’s irregular lifestyle is leading to obesity in most people. Being overweight means excess fat, which can also lead to many diseases.

What are you waiting for? Analyze your health today with the help of our blood glucose tracker application and take your treatment to the next level.

A blood glucose tracker includes a diabetes tracker, which is free to use and keeps track of your data. It’s an important application for a person who needs to check their blood glucose, blood pressure level, and body weight regularly. You can now track and manage the data of:

• Also comes with a weight tracker, blood pressure tracker, and estimated A1C data tracker.

By giving mindful consideration to exactly when and how much food you consume every day – after writing down what’s happening in the present moment - you can not only begin healing ...

But ultimately find freedom, peace, and just being normal around food so you can be yourself, have great food moments with friends, and live your best life!

Food is a common trigger of digestive symptoms. Avoiding certain foods or keeping a low FODMAP diet can dramatically improve issues like gas, bloating, stomach pain, diarrhoea, constipation and others.

However, everyone is different and there is no one-size-fits-all IBS diet: Keeping a diary of what you eat and how you feel is vital to learning what triggers your symptoms.

Take charge of your digestion and gut health.

PERSONALISED TRACKER 
Add custom foods and symptoms that are personal to you and track them together with the others. Endive knows recipes and breaks them down into ingredients to make IBS tracking faster and more efficient.

If you have a condition you know about, but want to optimise your diet to help improve your symptoms, Endive helps you keep track of what you have eaten and how you feel, both physically and psychologically. This allows you to learn how your body reacts to different foods, or which triggers (e.g. anxiety, depression) are causing you symptoms.

WIDE RANGING TRACKER

Endive helps you manage conditions such as:

• IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome)
• IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)
• Food intolerance and sensitivities (such as Dairy, Wheat/Gluten, Lactose)
• Acid reflux
• Crohn’s disease
• Coeliac disease
• SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth)
• Ulcerative colitis
• Migraines & cluster headaches
• Skin issues (such as Eczema, Acne)
• Period / menstrual cycle related issues
• Bloating, heartburn, and many other digestive conditions

A message from the founder:

Hey there! It's George.

In 2021, I decided to try losing weight by tracking my food and weighing myself every day.

I took written notes on a piece of paper I stuck inside my closet.

This surprisingly small habit gave me insight into what habits helped me lose or gain weight.

And wow did I lose weight! I lost 35 lbs.

Nothing extreme, but it meant a lot to me.

What's crazy is that I was eating ice cream, pizza, pasta, bread. All my favorite foods were fair game.

Wouldn't you want to do the same? Well maybe you could.

That's why I decided to turn my paper notes into an app. An app that I would want to use to continue losing more weight in a sustainable way.

As I was developing this app I lost another 5lbs. Not bad eh?

Clearly, this method works for me, and maybe it will for you."

Success Journal is a ledger of your daily accomplishments. However, instead of simply keeping a list, it’s best if you analyze each accomplishment and determine what the drivers of success were. That way, whenever you’re about to start a new project or endeavor, you can refer to your success journal and see what has worked in the past. 

Motivate yourself with Success Journal
Writing down what you did well can give you a sense of achievement. Positive emotions like this release the neurotransmitter dopamine, which makes you feel good, gives you energy and motivates you to keep doing things that will trigger the release of more dopamine. In other words, once your own success gives a feeling of accomplishment, you’ll be more motivated to keep working hard to achieve more success. 

If you really want to move your life forward, don’t forget to keep Success Journal. Because when you understand how your actions led to a positive outcome, you’ll literally have your own formula for success at your fingertips!

"1511065007";"Diem | The Daily Photo Journal";"Want to change your life? Start this one habit – journal!

Diem is the best journaling app to help you remember and look back at your life, memorializing the moments and milestones that led you to where you are today. 

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, Diem helps you memorialize your life with photo entries. Diem automatically displays photos from your library to easily add to your daily journal entries.

Journaling has been proven to provide positive well-being and significant health benefits including healing from mental health issues as well as loss and grief.

Successful people and visionaries throughout history have kept journals, including Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci and many others.

RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTS 

Experts say journaling may be the most useful activity you will ever add to your personal development arsenal.

Scientific studies have shown that journaling can boost mindfulness, memory and communication skills and have also found that writing in a journal can lead to better sleep, a  stronger immune system, more self-confidence and even a higher I.Q.

Journaling may sound hokey to some. But it can be one of the most useful and effective tools we have to forge a better, more emotionally and mentally healthy life.

REASONS YOU’LL LOVE DIEM

Journaling externalizes your memories, giving your mind space to process more or work through a dramatic situation or event. Journaling has been called “the ultimate self-healing tool”.

Diem helps you reflect on your day, your experiences, and your life. You can use Diem to track your successes and analyze setbacks and failures so that you can learn from those moments as well.

Simply take a few moments each day to reflect and memorialize the day. You can add photos and emotions. Diem also uses advanced machine learning and natural language processing to analyze your journal entries and automatically pick a corresponding emotion. You can always override this of course. Over time, you’ll be able to look back through the months and years and see what you did on the same day each year.

Add the beautiful Diem iOS Home Screen widget to see journal entries from the day, throughout the years.

Diem helps you stay motivated with reminders, streaks and badges. Share them or beautifully formatted journal entries with friends and family.

Diem helps to illuminate powerful insights into your thoughts and emotions. See how you’ve been feeling over the past 7, 30, 90 days, the past year or all time. Diem also uses advanced machine learning and natural language processing to help you explore the most common words and topics from your journal entries.

Security and privacy are very important to us. Diem does not share your personal information or journal entries in any way. Your data is only backed up to your Apple iCloud account for safe keeping and syncing to all your devices.

BENEFITS OF JOURNALING

* Clarify your thoughts and feelings: get in-touch with your internal world.
* Know yourself better: get to know what makes you feel happy and confident.
* Reduce stress: writing about anger, sadness and other painful emotions helps to release the intensity of these feelings.
* Resolve disagreements with others: writing about misunderstandings rather than stewing over them will help you to understand another’s point of view.

Keeping a journal (or a diary) is one of the best things you can do for your health. It can give you clarity and help you develop your mental health and get through tough times.

We are journalers ourselves and we know how much writing a diary has helped us. There are a lot of journaling apps in the app store, but we couldn't find one that we really liked. We wanted something simple, but delightful. Something that helps us focus on writing without distracting us with a huge amount of features and popup messages.

Pocket Journal is a simple but carefully crafted little app. We hope that you will fall in love with it like we have.

Pocket Journal’s core features include:

WRITING
By removing all sorts of fancy writing features that most apps are filled with, we have crafted an experience that is calm, unobtrusive and aesthetically pleasing allowing you to focus on what you want to write instead of what the app can do.

READING
It is pleasing for the eyes to read your journal and easy to navigate to the pages that you want to read.

KEEP MULTIPLE JOURNALS
You can write in multiple journals and diaries in Pocket Journal. Create a private diary for writing down your thoughts and feelings. Or create a journal where you keep track of your house plants. It is all up to you. 

USE EMOJIES TO REGISTER YOUR MOOD
Tag entries with emojies for easy mood tracking or to visually emphasize what an entry is about. With emoji tagging, you can organise your diary the way you’d like.

BOOKMARK
You can bookmark your most important entries to make them easy to find later on.

SECURE AND PRIVATE
Lock your diary and use FaceID / TouchID to unlock your diary. Keep it private and only for you.

BACKUP TO ICLOUD
Don’t loose your diary entries. Use our backup to iCloud feature so that you can always continue on your next iPhone.

THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
We want to build the best and simplest diary and we have only just begun. As we continue to develop the app we will build new features.

With love from the Pocket Journal team, we wish you happy journaling.

&#9734; Vous pouvez également y joindre une photo illustrant vos propos, mais aussi un enregistrement audio si vous souhaitez constituer un mémo vocal du récit de l'événement.

&#9734; Enfin, vous pourrez exporter par email vos données afin de constituer plus facilement votre dossier.

Built to suit all restaurants, from the small local through to the big chains of the world. Designed to be reliable, concise, agile, scalable and uncomplicated.

The Parable removes the complications of handling a paperback diary and builds a database of customers and reservations, recording customer preferences and attendance which can be used to drive business time and time again to people you know that use and promote your business.

Key Features of The Parable:
• System works completely offline, and backs up to The Parable server when an internet connection is available, so your reservations are not only always accessible, but also secure.
• Your customer’s details, preferences and attendance history are all stored, allowing you to better serve your clientele.
• The Parable is designed to replace a paperback diary. Our daily notes and reminder feature allows you to type messages as you would write them in your paperback, ie call John regarding menu on the 25th October.
• We understand that all café and restaurants are different. You may have many small tables which are moved around or joined together to suit your reservations, others may have a set table layout and others may have function areas. The Parable easily handles all table management scenarios.
• We also know that different reservations require different levels of information, our reservation system allows you to add attachments (add photos of a table setup or attach a document with a running sheet), and even place a booking as a tentative.
• Daily bookings can be sorted by time, name, table area/ table number and group size. This feature assists you to seat your guests and setup your tables. Should you choose to print your guestlist, AirPrint is enabled.
• Waitlist feature is enabled, so even if you have a full house, you can still turnover tables.
• The Parable can receive bookings online and confirm reservations manually and automatically by way of email and sms.
• The Parable has subscription options (no contracts) which are scalable to the size of your business so even if you are just starting out you still have access to all that the Parable has to offer. The first month is free of charge.

We know what it's like to run a busy restaurant and café. We do it every day. So we know first hand the inefficiencies of the paper reservation diary. But we also know the benefits.
The Parable is designed to take the things you love about the ""old school"" reservation diary, while solving the things you hate. So you can stop trying to do a million things at once and let The Parable handle some of it for you.

Created FOR Restaurant and Café owners.
Created BY Restaurants and Café owners.

Zen was developed based on the developer's own struggles of not being able to continue any diary.

- Effortlessly Record
If you try to write perfectly, you will not know where to start.
Zen allows you to keep a diary in a simple and easy manner by recording what happened in fragments, line by line, just like a note.
Even on days when you are tired, you can keep a diary as if it were a note, making it easy to continue to keep a diary every day.
Of course, you can also record detailed information.

- Calendar Sync
Zen automatically displays your schedule for the day by connecting to your calendar.
This makes it easy to look back on the day and smoothly start writing in the diary.
Even if you forget to keep a diary for a few days, you can easily keep a diary by checking the day's schedule.

- Make Journaling a Habit
Receiving notifications at a set time every day will support in making journaling a habit.

- Minimal
We paid special attention to the design because it is an app that you use every day.
The minimal design allows you to keep track of your daily activities intuitively without getting lost in the operations.

- Wabi-sabi
Wabi-sabi is a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection.

We are not perfect.
So we don't need to write perfect sentences.
Just write what you think.

The essence is short.
That's why Zen has a limit of 280 characters.

- Security
You can set a password when you start the app to further enhance your privacy.
You can also unlock the app with fingerprint or face-ID.

- Organize with Tags
You can add keywords or categories related to your diary as tags. 
This allows you to efficiently manage and search diary entries using tags.


Don’t worry, just write.

Our Story
There are many diary apps in the world, but I couldn't master any of them because they are all too complex. So, I decided to create my own minimal diary app that only includes the bare minimum necessary features. 

The only thing this app can do is to record and look back on daily events.

I am constantly updating the app so that people who are looking for a simple diary app like me can be satisfied with it.

I would be happy if this app can be of any help in your life.
I wish for your life to be enriched.

"1525072324";"Travel Diary Tracker Lite";"Make your life a diary of places
Without any effort

Everyone knows where you were last summer ... yesterday ... the night before. Everybody knows. Google, Bing, even Apple and Amazon. Because everyone has access to your location data. The only person scratching their heads when asked where you were at 11:30 a.m. last Tuesday ... are YOU

The travel diary fills this knowledge gap. It remembers the places where you stayed, their location and the length of your stay. Then it looks for the photos you took there, looks in Wikipedia for interesting information such as castles or churches in the area and the new entry in the diary is ready. Without even opening the app. And if you feel thirsty or gnawing hunger, it even helps you to get to the nearest café or restaurant.


Over time you will receive a nice and informative travel diary. Only for you. Because the information will never leave your phone. At most on your Apple Watch. So you can always check where you've been hanging around since installing the app.

And even better: it also helps you to go back there. Have you ever been on a mountain or in the forest and found a nice place or enjoyed the view? And on the hike next year you can’t remember how to get there?

Well, Travel Diary offers you two ways to get to any place it shows you - regardless of whether it is a diary entry that was recorded for you in the background or a point of interest that you want in your area. Every location shown in the app has a button for a directional compass and for navigation.

Navigation uses the power of Apple Maps to give you the best routing experience you can have on iPhone. The wheel doesn't have to be reinvented, right? ;)

The compass determines the direction to this destination and displays a bright red arrow that points exactly to this location.

On the Apple Watch you get the most useful parts of the iPhone app, optimized for the smaller display. A list of the places you have been, with each day of the week in a clear color for better distinction. And either with the red compass arrow or with Apple Maps you will be guided there safely

Have fun with the app and I hope it is as useful for you as it is for me"

"635304706";"Risk Journals";"Risk Journals deliver academically rigorous, practitioner-focused content and resources for the rapidly evolving discipline of financial risk management.

Each quarter Risk Journals contain peer-reviewed research and technical papers, delivered to a global audience in print and online. Risk Journals serve broad and international readership communities that bridge academia and industry. The mission of Risk Journals is to equip readers with the tools to fulfill their professional potential.

Four of the nine titles in the Risk Journals portfolio are available in app format. Topics covered include computational finance, operational risk, risk management, and credit risk. 

Led by Editor-in-Chief Farid AitSahlia from the University of Florida, The Journal of Risk aims to further develop understanding of financial risk management. As the only publication devoted exclusively to theoretical and empirical studies in financial risk management, the journal promotes far-reaching research on the latest innovations in this field, with particular focus on the measurement, management and analysis of financial risk.

With the re-writing of the Basel accords in international banking and their ensuing application, interest in credit risk has never been greater. The Journal of Credit Risk is at the forefront in tackling the many issues and challenges posed by the recent financial crisis, focussing on the measurement and management of credit risk, the valuation and hedging of credit products, and the promotion of greater understanding in the area of credit risk theory and practice.

The Basel Committee's 2014 revision of its operational risk capital framework, along with the multi-billion-dollar settlements that financial institutions had to make with financial authorities, has made operational risk the key focus of risk management. The Journal of Operational Risk stimulates active discussions of practical approaches to quantify, model and manage this risk, also discussing current issues in the discipline, and is essential reading for keeping practitioners and academics informed of the latest research in operational risk theory and practice.

Led by Editor-in-Chief Cornelis (Kees) Oosterlee from the CWI - National Research Center for Mathematics and Computer Science and Delft University of Technology, this international peer-reviewed journal focuses on the advances in numerical and computational techniques in pricing, hedging and risk management of financial instruments.

"1553501165";"Family Search Journal";"I love doing family history.

I love finding information about my ancestors - where they are from, when they were born and what their lives were like.

But, I usually only have time on the weekends or a couple of times each month to sit down and really dig in to research.

Because of this - I end up searching the same records over and over....and over again because I can't remember if I had already searched a particular census record or immigration record. 

If you've done family history research, you know what I'm talking about...

You've entered your fairly common ancestors name and get hundreds of possible matches in the results.

After looking through the 5th or 6th record, you take a short break, or maybe a break for the week and when you come back and start your search again - you can't remember which records you've already searched!

I know, I could've used a notebook or some paper - but I really don't like clutter and don't want to have to lug around a notebook whenever I'm at a research library or visiting a cemetery.

I also don't want my notebook to get lost!

So I created this app - it makes it super easy to track each ancestor and more importantly the records I'm searching!

I can easily add any type of record to any piece of vital information - like their birth information.

As I'm looking through records, I can mark a record as:
 
- Currently Searching (So when I come back next week I remember where I left off)
- Has Information (Easy to reference later if anyone needs to know who I know where they were born)
- Does not have information (If a record doesn't actually have my ancestors information).

A really nice thing about this as well is that I can quickly search all the records. So if I've only searched 3 or 300, it's quick and easy to see if I've already searched a record or not for my ancestors.

I store all of this information securely in the cloud so only I have access to it.

And since it's in the cloud and on this app - it's easy to access, reference and update when I'm on the go.

The one downside of being in the cloud though, is that it costs $$. 

I wish that I could offer the app 100% free for everyone, but unfortunately things just cost money.

As I thought about it though - I realized that I already pay for things like movie subscription services and online shopping.

And while those things are nice to have - they don't compare with being able to find and connect with my ancestors.

So I'm happy to offer the app at a low monthly or annual price which is way less than what I pay for those other ""nice"" subscriptions.

And at the end of the day, you really can't put a price on connecting with family.

But to make sure that you really like the app - I've also included a 1 month free trial. 

I'm really excited to offer this app and I hope that you're able to use it to make your family search experience easy and more enjoyable.

If you have any suggestions or concerns please email me: 
familysearchjournal@gmail.com

I'd also love to hear how Family Search Journal has changed how you duo family research!

A purchase will be applied to your iTunes account at the end of your 1 month trial on confirmation.
Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

Our goal with DayNote is to help you discover something lost during the day - the moment to pause and answer some of life's most important questions.

As a guided journal, DayNote becomes a place where thoughts are recorded and collected as answers to four significant questions. 

These questions are:

What did you learn?
What did you achieve?
What were your good experiences?
What can I improve?

And that's all you have to do. Preferably daily, but if not, as often as you can, answer these questions to the best of your ability. 

Over time, as you create journal entries, a wealth of knowledge tailored to your experiences will grow and become increasingly valuable to your personal growth. 

With DayNote, remember what you learnt, be proud of your achievements and reminisce positive memories.

"1148328185";"eFlightJournal";"What started out as a “Hey, it’d be cool if my iPhone had a count down timer that spoke on intervals so I know how much longer I can fly my plane” has turned into a full featured RC model flight tracking app that I use for every flight.

eFlightJournal has that talking flight timer and as an added bonus keeps a history of your flights organized by plane, battery and location  - including a summary of total flights and duration for each.   

The timer screen allows you to quickly select the plane and battery and will automatically detect the location making getting up into the air a snap.   It can be configured to speak the time, vibrate or play a sound on various intervals allowing you to concentrate on flying.

It also maintains the current state of batteries (charged, discharged, storage) as well as can track their charge-cycles.  Batteries that require charging display the flight time on the battery (in red) since last charge.

If there is something eFlightJournal doesn't do or can do better please let me know and I'll see what I can come up with (for contact information see the eFlightJournal More > About).

"6443627476";"Accountable: Photo Habit Diary";"Capture your progress and fuel your motivation with our daily photo journal app. Based on the science of visual memory, our app encourages you to take one photo per day for your projects, holding you accountable, forming habits and keeping you motivated.

Visual memory studies have shown that the brain has a remarkable ability to remember images and visual information. By taking a daily photo of your progress, this app allows you to tap into the power of your visual memory to stay motivated and accountable. By looking back at your photos over time, you can see how far you've come and stay inspired to continue your journey.

Studies have also shown that tracking progress and maintaining a streak of consistent action can be highly effective in achieving goals. With this app's streak feature (only available in the premium version through an subscription), you can see how many consecutive days you've taken a photo and keep that streak alive, providing a sense of accomplishment and a strong motivator to keep going. It tunes in your self discipline and helps you reach the goals you set.

In addition to streaks, the app also provides detailed statistics for progress tracking (available in the Premium version only through a subscription), including how many daily photos you have taken to maximise your personal growth. It’s the ultimate self improvement tool.

The app also allows you to customise your notification times (only available with the Premium version as an in app subscription), so you can receive reminders to take your daily photo at a time that works best for you. You can also add comments and location information to your photos, making it easy to remember important details about your progress.

Whether you're working on a fitness goal, a creative project, or simply want to track your daily routine, this app is a powerful tool to help you stay motivated and accountable. With its scientifically-backed approach, streaks, and statistics, it's the perfect companion for anyone looking to achieve their goals and capture their progress and build daily habits along the way.

All photos are also stored locally so privacy is not an issue. Download now!

Personally I have used it to finish the app its self by taking a photo every step of the way. Allowing me to feel motivated to work on it daily. I couldn’t have done it without it."

"6444498195";"Elena's Journal: To Atlantis";"Elena and Nathan had barely returned from their exhilarating adventure in the City of Amazons when they decided to embark on another journey. This time, they were on a mission to find Atlantis, the lost city that had intrigued and fascinated Nathan for as long as he could remember.

As they set out on their journey, they faced a new set of challenges that tested their courage and determination. Nathan's lifelong dream of discovering the lost city drove them forward, but the journey was far from easy.

Elena, on the other hand, struggled with her own personal demons. The pressures of academia weighed heavily on her, as did the drama within her family. Moreover, conflicts with Nathan only added to her stress, making it difficult for her to remain focused on their mission.

The two found temporary relief in the form of visits from friends, but their happiness was short-lived as they soon realized that an enemy lurked in the shadows, craving revenge. The tension continued to rise as they encountered new obstacles and dangers, putting their work, passion, and very lives in jeopardy.

Despite the challenges they faced, Elena and Nathan remained determined to find Atlantis and unlock its secrets. They knew that they needed to stay strong, focused, and united if they hoped to survive the challenges ahead.

In the end, Elena and Nathan would have to make some tough choices. They would need to decide what was most important to them, and what they were willing to risk to achieve their dreams. But no matter what, they knew that they would have each other to rely on as they faced whatever lay ahead.

FEATURES:
- Grab the excavation tools again, this time to unearth the secrets of the lost land of Atlantis.
- Join Elena’s new adventures, full of plot twists and secrets of the past.
- Meet your favourite characters again, and get to know the new ones, entangled in a new intrigue.
- Visit amazing new locations in which the past and the present intertwine.
- Finish all 60 levels of the game on one of three difficulty levels.
- Find out if the next journey will have a happy ending for Elena and Nathan.

"1585708887";"Hindsight - Micro Journal";"Reflection is the best investment we can make to live a better day. It doesn’t take filling up entire pages in a journal to find insights. Short notes about the moments of life add up to a big picture of where we are and help us see more clearly where we want to go.

Hindsight is designed to help forge a new habit of reflection in the day-to-day. Customizable to your priorities but dead-simple so nothing bogs you down.

Create categories for anything you want to keep track of and set reminders to help keep yourself consistent. 

Slowing down for a few seconds to think about the moment and jot down a note can bring a surprising boost of intentionality to our lives, but occasionally read the notes from your past self to get the best perspective. 

Once you have a Hindsight habit, use that newfound perspective to choose the next habit you want to practice—and you can add a new category for it to keep track of your progress.

Customizable color schemes for each category and Dark Mode support make this habit easy on the eyes."

With its simple interface and daily prompts, Grateful is designed to make reflection and giving thanks both a joyful and easy process.  Daunted by a blank page? Not quite sure where to start? Grateful will greet you with one question, such as. 'What made you smile today'? or 'What made today a good day?'. All you have to do is answer. It can be a simple word. Or a simple paragraph. Grateful allows for both. You can also add a photo to support your thoughts.

*Easy to Browse your Past Entries*
Grateful's simple  journal feed  lets you browse your entries by TIME or by PROMPT. Want to see all the things that made you smile this year? Jump to those entries in your timeline. Want to see what your state of mind was last January? Jump to that month in your timeline.

Maybe not, BUTT, it is an important thing for you to keep track of as an indicator of your digestive health.

Tracking the transit time, color, and shape of your movements can be a helpful indicator of the overall health of your digestive system and your entire body.

You may have noticed that when you eat corn kernels, they come out the same way they went in, which makes them extremely useful for tracking transit time through your digestive system.

The Kernel Journal was designed to make it simple for you to track your transit time by starting the timer when you eat corn, and then stopping it when you see it again!
You can also use the Kernel Journal to track your non-corn related bowel movements, as well as compare your times against friends to see who’s faster!

"725299862";"Blood Pressure & Pulse Diary";"This app is a professional tool helping you to collect, track and analyze your blood pressure and pulse measurements on a daily basis. Thus, it is a fully adequate blood pressure record card.

Simply add and edit your blood pressure. As a result, you will have your records always available.

This App classifies your records to the different stages of hypertension. You can visualize your measurements in different charts and save these statistics as snapshots to your camera roll.

Moreover, you can export your records as spreadsheet files to share conveniently with your doctor.

Create reminders to help you remember when to take your blood pressure and pulse measurements.

With the new version the app provides an interface to the HealthKit. 

Full scope: The app is free of advertising. There are no In-App purchases. You get the full product.

How it works: 

* Measure your blood pressure as usual with your blood pressure monitor 
* Launch the app 
* Enter your values 
* Done!

Features:

* HealthKit Integration 
* Easy storage of your blood pressure and pulse measurements
* Calculation of your pulse pressure
* Calculation of your stage of hypertension
* Easy addition of notes to each entry
* Export records in the format of CSV, MAIL or PDF
* Wifi Print
* Reminders
* Customization of your data range
* You can rotate your device every time to have a different look
* Visualization of measurements in graphs and statistics
* Visualization of stage of hypertension
* Saving your statistics as snapshots to Photos

There is an easy and comfortable storage of your blood pressure and pulse measurements. Change values by simplified scrolling or tap on Systolic, Diastolic or Pulse to use a numeric Pad. There is also an automatic calculation of the stage of hypertension. 

This App classifies your records to the 7 different stages of hypertension (from Hypotension to Hypertension Stage 3, based on the WHO classification). The stage of hypertension is also colorized. You can have a look at the summary to see a quantity and allocation of hypertension stages within your selected time period. You can also save the summary pie chart to your camera roll.

Furthermore, the App shows your measurement history. There are two types of displaying: standard and grouped!

* Standard: 
The standard display prepares your systolic records in a chronological order.

* Grouped: 
The display will prepare your records in a timeline and groups the records by day. For each day  the chart will show the highest and lowest systolic value.

There is also the classic diary log. With the logs you will get an overview of all your records. The logs are sorted by date, the newest record at the top. With the search on the top of the logs you can limit the display by entering a systolic value. The list will display only values that have a higher systolic value. Have a look at these values. You can then interpret when these values occur - for example, only late at night or early morning after rising.

You can see a detailed view for each record from the logs. Each detailed view shows you an automatic calculated stage of hypertension. If is there something special on these measurement, add a comment for later interpretation. You can also edit your values here. If you like to delete a record, jump back to the logs and swipe from right to left to delete the selected record.

How we handle health data?
This app will not send any data from you to us. We do not collect your precise health data or any other information about you or your device. The stored records can be transferred to your HealthKit, if you use these options.

The information within this app should not be considered medical advice and is not intended to replace consultation with a qualified medical professional.

If you have any suggestions for improvement or criticism please don't hesitate to contact us."

Lumen Trails Daily Tracker lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car! Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. 

“I've been using Daily Tracker for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza

The beauty of Daily Tracker is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits, or even net worth? Daily Tracker is the app for that!

Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. You'll have all your important data stored in one convenient place, for many years to come.

Designed exclusively for the iPhone and iPad, Daily Tracker is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 12 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Drive.

So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? 

Track it and get things done!

"1560847986";"Poz Journal";"Poz is a mindful journaling app. It helps you live mindfully with the simple magic of journaling. By combining the simplicity of a real-world notebook with the flexibility of a complex note-taking app, Poz has everything you need to build a consistent mindful journaling practice – 100% free.

With dynamic prompts, daily goals, password protection, and your own self-recorded entries, Poz is the perfect way to check in with yourself and reflect on what matters most.

When you take just five minutes each day to be mindful, you will learn more about who you are and restore your connection to each moment that matters. Every day you use it gives you the opportunity to create a record of personal growth and meaningful self-discovery.


DAILY GOAL & REMINDERS
Poz uses daily reminders and a daily goal to promote consistency, encouraging you to sit down a few times per day and build a habit of mindfulness. Unlike other reflective journaling apps, Poz has no time limits or “gamification” elements – just focus on your thoughts and feelings.

Simply set reminders for yourself to write in Poz each day, and respond to the wide range of prompts. We’ll help you focus your thoughts into something beautiful and useful. 


PROMPTS
With Poz, we’re trying to change the way society looks at journaling. Instead of haphazardly jotting down a few thoughts whenever you can, our app will remind you to write just a bit in your journal each day and offer an experience that takes you through different kinds of prompts based on where you are in your day. With a wide range of prompts to choose from, you’re sure to find a topic that resonates.

At the end of the day, the most important part of a consistent and fulfilling journaling practice is your genuine reflection. Poz’s password protection and simple interface invites you to pour all your thoughts onto the page/


PASSWORD PROTECTED
Poz is YOUR personal journaling app. Use Face/Touch ID or a password to protect your prompts, and feel the freedom of a completely secure place to express your inner world. All your notes are stored on your device, so no one has any access to a single word you write, including us. 


COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE
Change the name, color, pattern, basically everything about your journal and the journaling experience so you can feel completely comfortable when reflecting on your day or pouring out your soul.


Poz encourages small moments of introspection throughout the day. Whether you’re someone who likes to write their thoughts out in full sentences or only needs a few minutes of clarity, Poz has been designed for anyone who could use a space to document and reflect on their life."

Keeping detailed records of headache episodes can help provide additional insight about triggers and how to avoid them.

This app is designed to help you understand and manage your headachesby recording information about them and any treatments used (medicine and non-medicine options).
Your doctor will want to know the overall pattern of your headaches, how they affect you, the treatments used and what the triggers may be. Doctors and people who experience frequent and persistent headaches have found that keeping a diary for one month can help you and your doctor get more from your consultation. 

Use our headache diary to:
- Track the frequency of your headaches, the treatments used and how effective they were for you
- Understand your headache experience / patterns including symptoms and triggers
- Be better prepared to discuss your headache with your health professional.

It is important to write down information about your headaches. Every time you have a headache, make notes in your diary. This information will help you and your healthcare provider learn about your headaches. This will also help you and your health provider make a plan for treating your headache. 

It is also important to make an appointment with your doctor for the specific purpose of addressing your headache history rather than discussing headaches as part of a physician visit for other reasons. We also recommend keeping a headache diary to track the characteristics of your headaches. Patterns identified from your diary may help your doctor determine which type of headache you have and the most beneficial treatments."

"1597620252";"Eating Buddy - Food Diary";"Getting to the root cause of weight gain

When it comes to losing weight, people are often looking for a quick fix:
- ""I will no longer eat sugar or refined cereals.""
- ""I will only eat 1200 calories per day.""
- ""I will only eat between 12 and 7 PM.""
- ... and so on.

Sadly, the solution to reaching and maintaining an optimal weight is more nuanced than that. Restrictive diets can be too temporary, often leaving you in a worse place than you were before starting them. 

To get fit and healthy, you must fix your eating habits and eat in response to physiological hunger.

People are not getting fat because of the occasional pizza, burger, or cookie. The real culprit is that overeating has become very easy because of the increasingly stressful environments and the rise of convenience foods. Many people have gotten disconnected from their body signals and eat for different reasons (boredom, distraction, stress, loneliness, etc. ). 

Here's where Eating Buddy enters the picture!

Eating Buddy helps you to keep track of your eating patterns, raises awareness about your food decisions, and enables you to make healthier choices in the long run.

Eating Buddy doesn't utilize restrictive methods. Instead, it follows intuitive eating principles, helping you focus on your habits to find better ways to eat that work for you in the long run.

With Eating Buddy, you will re-learn to:
- Recognize hunger cues
- Eat only when hungry
- Pick the right foods for you
- Stop when satisfied.

Give Eating Buddy a try and witness the positive changes in your eating habits!

How It Works

You can get to the bottom of your eating habits by noting how hungry you are, when, and what you eat.
From hungry to stuffed, track how your meals make you feel, quickly discovering a better balance.
Come to grips with how you feel, learning your hunger states and triggers.

The Timeline

Eating Buddy features a comprehensive timeline, showcasing your hunger states, the meals you ate, their reasons, and a symbol for your post-meal state - letting you quickly decipher when you're on track and not.

The Analysis Page

The Analysis Page helps you see your food patterns over the last seven days. You will easily find the number of meals logged, the percentage of them eaten when hungry, and at what point overeating may have occurred."

-Divide & Conquer
-Non-Zero Days
-Habit Formation

How it works? Very simple!

Step 1: Plan Your Goal Levels
Let's say your daily goal is to write 400 words. Break it down into six levels:
RED - Write next to nothing (less than 100 words)
ORANGE - Write at least something (100+ words)
YELLOW - Midway through your goal (200+ words)
GREEN - Nearly meet your goal (300+ words)
BLUE - Meet your goal (400+ words)
PURPLE - Exceed your goal (500+ words)

Step 2: Track Your Progress
When a day is finished, mark the date with the color corresponds to your goal levels.

Avoid RED days as much as possible; when you reach the next level, try your best to keep it up!"

"1471602446";"My SOAP Journal";"My SOAP Journal helps by making the Bible journaling process a bit easier. It functions as a central database to record your SOAP journals and making it easy to access on multiple devices. No more looking for pieces of paper or trying to filter through notes/emails etc. to find a specific journal entry. 

The Bible is hard to read for many people for many reasons – its length, strange vocabulary, confusing stories. In spite of that, the Bible is a beautifully designed book. It is a unified story that leads to Jesus and has profound wisdom for us in this modern world. God loves to speak to people through his word – sometimes with jaw-dropping revelations and other times simple reminders of His love for us. You’ll soon find that once you make simple bible journaling a habit, it will become an integral part of your relationship with God!

What is SOAP?

Soap is a very easy helpful tool to make reading and meditating on the Word of God a lot simpler. 
 
SOAP stands for:
S = Scripture (Read a passage of scripture)
O = Observation (Note if anything in this passage speaks to your heart and what it may have meant for the original audience)
A = Application (What do you believe this means for you and how will you apply this to your life)
P = Prayer (Write out a simple prayer asking God to help you apply it to your life)"

Die Pferdedaten werden sicher und dauerhaft in der Cloud gespeichert, es wird gewährleistet, dass nur berechtigte Personen Zugang zu diesen Daten haben.

Horse Diary ist eine Multiuser-App. Jedermann kann die App auf seinen Geräten installieren und virtuelle Ställe selber anlegen. Möchtest Du aber deine Daten mit anderen gemeinsam nutzen, also im Team arbeiten, dann vergibst Du Einladungen an deine Freunde, Mitarbeiter oder Kunden. Diese zusammen bilden das Team eines ""virtuellen"" Stalls.

Das Team besteht aus all jenen Menschen, denen Zugriff auf die Daten der App gewährt wurde. Dabei werden aber individuelle Unterschiede gemacht. Jedem Team-Mitglied wird eine Rolle zugewiesen, die seine Rechte bzgl. der Daten und Funktionen der App regelt.
Es gibt vier verschiedene Rollen:

1. Besitzer
2. Administrator
3. Teammitglied
4. Gast

Ein Gast darf
1. Die Pferde sehen und ihre Stammdaten lesen aber nicht verändern.
2. Die Kontakte sehen und ihre Stammdaten lesen aber nicht verändern.
3. Notizen lesen, eigene Notizen schreiben und auch verändern oder löschen. Notizen anderer Benutzer kann er nur lesen.

Ein Teammitglied darf zusätzlich
1. Pferde anlegen, verändern und löschen.
2. Impfungen, Wurmkuren, Beschläge und medizinische Behandlungen eines Pferdes erfassen, verändern und löschen.
3. Kontakte anlegen, verändern und löschen.

Ein Administrator darf zusätzlich
1. Benutzer anlegen und Rollen zuordnen und auch Benutzer löschen. Aber keinen Administrator benennen.

Für den Besitzer gibt es keine Einschränkungen
1. Insbesondere kann nur er Administratoren anlegen und virtuelle Ställe erzeugen.

Ein virtueller Stall ist eine Zusammenfassung von Daten über Pferde, Kontakte, Notizen, Aufgaben und Terminen. Zwischen verschiedenen Ställen gibt es keine Überschneidungen und auch keinen Datenaustausch. Sie bilden eine geschlossene Einheit. So wird ermöglicht, dass Du sowohl eigene Ställe haben als auch Mitglied im Team eines anderen Stalls sein kannst. 

Einladungen
Als Besitzer eines Stalles kannst Du Einladungen erstellen. Dafür benötigst Du die gültige email-Adresse dessen, dem Du Zugang gewähren möchtest. Du gibst weiterhin an, ob es ein Gast, ein Teammitglied oder ein Administrator sein soll. Der Eingeladene muss die Einladung annehmen.

Wozu Credit Points?

Du zahlst nur für die Nutzung von Horse Diary. Bei jedem Datenbankzugriff wie lesen, schreiben oder löschen werden Credit Points verbraucht. Zusätzlich zu diesen Transaktionskosten werden Credit Points für die Kosten der Belegung von Speicherplatz abgezogen, dies erfolgt auf Zeitbasis. 

Wenn Du einen neuen Stall anlegst, erhältst Du 1.000 Credit Points als Startguthaben geschenkt. Das ermöglicht Dir mit der App kostenlos zu starten und in Ruhe zu testen.

Die Credit Points sind an den Stall gebunden, daher kann jeder im Team Credit Points kaufen. Ebenso kann jeder im Team eines Stalles die App Horse Diary nutzen, unabhängig davon, ob er oder sie selbst die Credit Points erworben hat.

"1517094829";"Notary eJournal";"The Notary eJournal by Jurat INC is an electronic notary journal created to provide a digital replacement for the standard hard-bound notary journals that exist in the market. Designed by and for notaries in the State of California, it adheres to the most strict and up-to-date notary journal guidelines in the United States.

Before considering use of any electronic notary journal, a notary public should check their state requirements to ensure adherence to all guidelines. You can also visit our webpage for information regarding which states specifically prohibit the use of an electronic notary journal, as well as other notary journal considerations

The Notary eJournal was designed by signing agents in the State of California that work in the high-volume real estate & lending environment, often individually responsible for helping close hundreds of refinance, purchase and sale transactions per month. Given this workflow and industry insight, the Notary eJournal was created with the following priorities in mind:

Compliance - California has some of the strictest guidelines for notaries when it comes to the notary journal. As the only State to require capturing a thumbprint for certain notarizations, it is imperative for any useful electronic notary journal to provide such functionality. Our team has tested numerous bluetooth thumbprint capturing devices and has made the Notary eJournal compatible with the best bluetooth thumbprint scanner available to the public. The link this device can be found on our website.

*Note - this bluetooth thumbprint capturing device must be purchased separately

Ease of Use - The guided workflow provided by the Notary eJournal will ensure your signing appointments aren’t slowed down by the process of manually writing down all entry information and using an ink pad to capture thumbprints.

Technology - The Notary eJournal safely and securely implements features meant to truly make your job easier. Key features include using your device location to input location information, taking a picture of a signers ID and having all important information automatically input in the appropriate fields, and using bluetooth thumbprint technology to capture any necessary thumbprints.

For a list of all product features please visit our webpage."

Scribble is perfect for people who wish to record their thoughts, but don’t have the time to sit down and write a long journal entry. Use Scribble whenever you have a thought that’s worth remembering and categorize it into a relevant journal/tag to easily find it later. 

One of the benefits of microjournaling over traditional journaling methods is that by writing down your thoughts in the moment, you get a more accurate picture of your thought process throughout the day.

FEATURES:

CATEGORIZE YOUR ENTRIES INTO JOURNALS
You can assign each entry to a specific journal/topic. This will color code your entries to the journal’s corresponding color and make your entries easier to organize. (i.e. Ideas, Goals, Insights, Dreams)

ADD TAGS TO FURTHER ORGANIZE YOUR ENTRIES
You can also assign multiple tags to each entry to help further categorize each entry. This can be helpful if you wish to have subcategories in each journal. 

FAVORITE ENTRIES
Add a heart next to your most important entries to help highlight them for easy access later.

VIEW ENTRIES FROM ANY DATE
Jump to a specific date to see all your entries at different points in time.

QUICKLY FILTER YOUR ENTRIES
You can quickly filter your entries by any combination of journals, tags, and more. Tap on any label to add that filter, and only see entries matching those filters

LOCK WITH TOUCH/FACEID
Keep your entries private by locking your journal with Touch/FaceId. You are still able to create new entries while your journal is locked to help make using Scribble as quick and easy as possible.

SCHEDULE REMINDERS FOR YOUR ENTRIES
Add a reminder to any entry and schedule a push notification for a specific time. Visit the Reminders screen to see all entries with a reminder, and mark them as complete when necessary.

**Note from developer: Thanks for being one of the first users of Scribble! Your feedback is extremely valuable, and I'm constantly looking for new ways to improve the app. If you have any questions, bugs, or feature requests, please email me at scribble.microjournal@gmail.com

"1208362996";"Prompted Journal: daily diary";"A daily journal for self-compassion.

Be your own best friend, cheerleader, spiritual guru, etc. with our carefully crafted daily journal prompts. It’s an easy way to incorporate self reflection into your life, and reflect on all the things that matter. 

Your diary is not just about writing what you ate for lunch. Instead, you can befriend yourself with thought-provoking prompts from day one. Reflect on your hopes and dreams, and really listen to yourself like a compassionate friend. If you’ve ever struggled to keep up with a diary, our daily journal prompts can remove the struggle of thinking of things to say, and make this journaling habit easy to maintain.

Each journal prompt comes with “Dive Deeper” questions to help you get the most out of your self care journal:
E.g. For the writing prompt: “Love is…”, reflect on Dive Deeper questions like “How do you show love towards others? How do others show love towards you? What was your first memory of feeling loved? Does love have a spiritual dimension for you? If so, how?” 
The Dive Deeper questions help prevent writer’s block, making journaling a powerful wellness tool from day one.

A daily diary can seem daunting, even tedious — when in fact, journaling can be a powerful self care habit. Read through our reviews: you’ll find users who have used this app as a therapy journal, a self help aid, and a thought diary of everything important to them. Your daily journal can be a deeply rewarding wellness ritual that helps you write thoughts you might have otherwise ignored. We hope Prompted Journal helps you uncover more of what you’re meant be. 

This writing app can feel like traveling through time. On day one, you’ll write a letter to your future self (1st prompt: Dear Future Me). About 3-4 months later, when the prompt recycles, you’ll be able to read your letter. While we love the physical diary, writing apps make it possible to instantly find the last time you answered the same journal prompt, or view ALL the times you answered the prompt at once. Watch your self esteem improve with each new cycle: your answers to journal prompts like “My biggest fear…” might show how you have overcome anxiety. This writing app becomes a conversation between you, your past self, and your future self. Your diary becomes a memento of how much you’ve grown. Just by incorporating a simple 5 minute journal habit into your life, you can get to know your inner me.

WHAT YOU GET:
* Self care journaling for busy lives: 190+ journal prompts ready to go, recurring every 3-4 months.
* Daily reminders help you write and reflect every day.
* Create a PDF of your diary to print, email, or save.
* Daily journaling made easy.

Life is a journey, and our prompts are designed to help you reflect daily on where you’re heading. Write your thoughts on everything from mental health to love to self esteem. Make the five minute journal session you can squeeze into your mornings equate to five hours of talking with your best friend. Also, customize your guided journal by making journal prompts that only you can: e.g. “My dog Lucy and I…” With a wide range of topics you can reflect on, you can see yourself in from various angles. 

OUR MISSION:
Self help and self therapy are difficult because all the incredible books and spot-on teachings don’t force you to put them into practice. “Love yourself,” “Be grateful,” etc. sound simple, but can be surprisingly hard to do. We hope our writing apps turn apparently “simple” self help mantras like “Love yourself” into wellness habits you can practice daily.

* We specialize in writing apps that foster self care and wellness. Please don’t hesitate to contact us.

WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY:
Your daily journal is yours and yours alone. We don’t store any of your data or ask you to create an account. We built this diary journal with your privacy in mind.

"1444134992";"HomeDiary";"HomeDiary is the most robust and fun way to Dream, Manage and Do more with your home through our free homeowner management platform. Log details about home improvements and maintenance activities and tag them to a space with Timeline. Snap a photo of each room for Inventory purposes to quickly document what’s in your house for insurance purposes. Save an Idea while shopping and tag it to a space. Through our companion web-based experience, use our robust 3D Space planner to draw a floor plan of a room or your whole house quickly and easily. Use it to design, place furniture, paint walls, change flooring or even add or remove walls, then with the push of a button, you can view it in 3D on any device, plus have access to any room’s dimensions where ever you go. 

Your Home. Your Data. HomeDiary is private and secure, using 256-bit encryption and everything you do is private by default. You own the data of what’s in your home and you control how it’s shared. As you add more data, you create a digital record of the home and any home specific data (floor plans, appliance details, home repairs, home pros) can be passed to future owners, if applicable. 

The app includes these great features:

Quick Input - use the app to document the Who Did What, Where, When and for How much. Snap a photo of a receipt, the paint can color, the furnace filter size or the repair bill for the garage door spring, or whatever... and log it for warranty, insurance or improvement purposes. Attach manuals, instructions or anything you want. 

Instant Search - instantly find anything your log with our app-wide search feature.  

Timeline - The visual log of the things you do, whether it is save an idea, log an inventory item, document a repair or set a reminder. Everything you log is sync’d to a secure database and is accessible via any iOS device, a personal computer, either through the iOS app (iPhone and IPad) or our mobile responsive website experience.

3D Spaces - Use our full-featured 2D/3D space planner to create a floor plan using your computer or iPad and visualize it on your iPhone. The 3D Spaces tool is the ultimate “What If” tool. Ever wonder what an open concept might look like for your home, or how hard wood floors might look in your office. Do virtual remodeling before physical work. It's like the floor plan tool you see on those home improvement shows on TV, but for your home. You can build a floor plan in as little as 5 to 10 minutes, and even trace over a source file (appraiser’s sketch, marketing brochure, architectural plans, etc). . 

Inventory - A picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, a picture can save you in case of disaster. About 75% of people have no documentation of what is in their home for insurance purposes, so what happens if there is a wildfire, flood, tornado, or other disaster?  Don’t get caught being unprepared for our most valued asset, as the insurance claim process can be a major hassle if you have no documentation. Take 10 minutes to just snap a few photos of each room and you have a baseline of what’s in your home to build a more detailed list in case of disaster. 

Ideas - Use our Ideas app to save things to your own Pinterest-like idea board, all tied to a space. Snap a photo of the cool couch, a rug or even homes you see, and save it to a space. On our companion web experience you can even use our web clipper to save images and page links. 

Reminders - Need help remembering to change your furnace filters for optimal operation, replacing your refrigerator’s water filter, or changing the batteries in the smoke detectors?  These are just a few of the reminders the app can help you stay on top of for your home. 

Companion website experience. We’re not just an app, we are complete cloud service too. So you can quickly add items via your iPhone or iPad and do more detailed space planning using any computer with your same login credentials at www.homediary.com."

5. Write your thoughts: Write about how you feel, why you feel that way, and the series of events that lead to the experience.Not sure what to write? Let our AI provide inspiration.

This means as soon as you create a new event on the app it will appear in your CPD on the website, which will then be sent to your e-portfolio account daily.

The app has a number of useful features including the ability to:

View your diary on the go. See all past entries and even edit them directly on the app.

Complete your CPD instantly. Ideal when you are at a conference or have just listened to the latest FOAMed podcast.

Export individual or multiple items ready for CPD. You can choose between just RCEM events, External events or both, then export an activity record or summary over any date range. You then have the ability to do whatever you want with the export. Print it, email it, share it.

Adding new events is really easy. The app mirrors the website and has 10 really easy dropdown sections that you can complete in seconds

All College conferences and CPD accredited events are featured on the app and can be added with the click of a button.

Leave reflections and outcomes. You can add these to all event types and event edit them if something else springs to mind later on.

Keep a track of your progress by mapping all your content to the GMC Domains.

Handy home screen that gives you an overview of your activity over the year, the time you have completed and a breakdown of areas you have completed.

Instant access to the RCEMLearning Twitter, Facebook, and iTunes accounts"

"1549699764";"Diary Survey Manager";"What is this application's purpose?

Diary Survey Manager or DSM for briefness is a mobile application to help survey respondents get reminders about their diary surveys. The application is easy and straightforward, providing friendly reminders to the survey respondents to follow through with a survey schedule without collecting or storing their personal information like e-mails, names, usernames, or passwords.

Important. Diary Survey Manager works only with anonymized unique per survey and per customer codes related to specific diary surveys. Third-party partners conduct these surveys, and to be able to use the Diary Survey Manager, you need to be onboarded by such a partner.

This app is not for you if:
- you have come across this app accidentally and don't know what it does;
- if you don't participate in diary survey research, or;
- if you don't have a unique code and guidance from a survey company to download this app.

This application is a utility tool that helps the survey respondents track their regular progress and get timely notifications in a secure, GDPR compliant, and comfortable manner. Understand it as a secure reminder helper, used by market research companies to facilitate their users without revealing their identity.

How the Diary Survey Manager works:
- First, you shall receive a unique ID from the market research survey partner you have an agreement with, and they will send you to the app page in Apple Store;
- Second, you need to download the app and allow push notifications - this is what this app is all about - friendly reminders per respondent and survey;
- Finally, add the unique ID through the app interface. That's all. 

After completing the above, you will start getting notifications for the particular survey you are participating in and will have for each survey a card with the following information: 
- your personal link to the survey for your ease; 
- name of the survey;
- information for the survey deadline. 
When the survey is completed for the day or paused by your partner, the app will not show the study's link - just info about it.  

When the survey is over, the box with the survey info will disappear from the customer panel.

All other activities, progress, bonuses, etc., will work in the same way as they regularly do with your survey partners. Please reach out to them if you have any survey questions. There is no way we can identify you or help with survey questions, as our app uses unique anonymized IDs."

Q:
Why is self-talk important?

A:
Self-talk is important in many ways. It’s the script that we use to frame our lives. If we constantly give ourselves negative messages, then we begin to develop automatic thoughts that take us from a particular incident to a negative emotional reaction. Conversely, if we engage in positive self-talk, we begin to view the world in a more positive manner and will ultimately feel better about ourselves. We can’t always control what happens, but we can control how we react to it!

Pssst… I’m Mia & I’m a Skwibbler. Well, my Mummy & Daddy are really! Skwibblers are Mummies & Daddies who use the Skwibble Baby Journal App to record all the funny stories and milestones safely and securely. 

Did your parents ever keep a baby book for you when you were younger? I'm sure most did. You know what we mean, those books that your parents started with great intentions, that ended up tucked away unfinished in the attic...It's no secret that, even in this digital age, not much has changed. Although now, recording those memories usually ends up as just another photo on a phone. 

At Skwibble, we want to change that, one baby step at a time :)

-------------

So, what can you do on Skwibble?

RECORD BABY MILESTONES 
Record all the funny baby stories, precious photos, every milestone - no matter how small – in their ""My Story"" page of their private baby book. And better yet, invite your family and friends - or Buddies - to share in the joy of your child growing up.

SHARE WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS
Skwibble makes it very easy to share your baby photos and memories with family and friends.

INTERACTIVE PLAYPENS
Creating a Playpen gives you complete control over who sees your content whilst creating a totally interactive experience for your 'Buddies' to enjoy. Add your friends and family to different Playpens and allow them to share in the joy of seeing your child grow.

CREATE MEMORY BOOKS
We make it super easy for you to create stunning, personalised memory books of various moments you, your baby and the rest of your family have been through. 

UPDATE BABY PHOTO JOURNALS
Update your Photo Journal with pictures of your child regularly and, in years to come, look back at how your child has grown day by day (and have all the embarrassing photos you could ever need at the drop of a hat)!

PRIVATE, SAFE AND SECURE
This is something we take very seriously and is at the top of our agenda for the Skwibble Baby Journal app. You can be sure that all your baby photos will be backed up securely in the cloud.

"1091289928";"Jail Diary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh";"This note book was received on 12 Sep 1929 when the agreement was made between the hunger strikers and Special Jail committee. It was written by great Indian Martyr Bhagat Singh while being in jail. This app contains the various writings,quotes and letters from notebook written by Bhagat Singh written while imprisoned. 

Bhagat Singh (1907 – 23 March 1931) was an Indian revolutionary socialist who was influential in the Indian independence movement. He studied European revolutionary movements as a teenager and was attracted to anarchist and Marxist ideologies. He worked with several revolutionary organisations and became prominent in the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA). 

Seeking revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, Singh assassinated John Saunders, a British police officer. He eluded efforts by the police to capture him. Soon after, he and Batukeshwar Dutt threw two bombs and leaflets inside the Central Legislative Assembly, and offered themselves for arrest. He gained widespread national support when he undertook a 116-day hunger strike demanding equal rights for European prisoners, and those Indians imprisoned for what he believed were political. Shaheed Bhagat Singh was convicted and hanged for his participation in the assassination, at the age of 23. 
This app contains the source from original documents of Martyr Bhagat Singh. The young generation will be able to understand the spirit and the ideas of great Martyrs. It is only with a correct and deeper understanding that one can play his part in the transformation of society."

Whether it's your morning time in the Word or prayer, a song that brings you to tears, a timely phone call from a friend, a verse that seems to highlight itself, a dream that changes your perspective, or a message that pierces your heart, God is speaking to you. And we believe that when God speaks, it deserves to be recorded and remembered. We built GodSpeaks to help people do just that. 

GodSpeaks is your with-you-everywhere journal of the God moments you can't afford to leave behind. It is your remind-you-when-you-need-it-most friend because we are called to remember on both our best and our worst days. We built GodSpeaks with technology that is normal for today, but we pray over what we've built with a God who is beyond our understanding. Our prayer is that God would take this app that we built, a simple offering, and allow it to impact all who use it. 

Revelations 3:2 - 3
Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God. Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent.

“Best mental health app there is. It doesn’t just give the usual breath, chill, a bot who you can't relate to and loads of articles to try to read when your not feeling up to it etc. It gives practical ways to challenge your thinking. Something you can actually do for yourself. That’s honestly powerful and positive. It’s so simple and easy to use too. It’s what people most often need, something they can actually do to help themselves.” App Store Review

"1624280409";"Plant Journal & ID - Ploi";"PLANT WATER REMINDERS DONE RIGHT

Let’s be honest: an app can't tell you exactly how often to water your plants because there are too many variables. The best way to use an app is to teach it when you water your plants so it can learn the schedule for each plant. All you need to do is mark plants as watered and Ploi does the rest!

PLANT JOURNAL

If you're looking for a way to keep track of your plant's life and get tips on how to care for them, Ploi is the plant app for you! With Ploi, you can log everything from when you watered your plant to when it started to bloom. Plus, our care guides are full of information on how to keep your plants healthy and happy.

GROWTH PROGRESS

If you're like most people, you probably have a few houseplants. Maybe you have a fiddle leaf fig tree or a peace lily. Perhaps you have a snake plant or a succulent. No matter what type of plant you have, it's important to document its growth.

One way to do this is to take photos of your plant at different stages of its life. For example, you might take a photo of your houseplant when you first get it, and then again after a month, and then every few months after that.

Another way to document your plant's growth is to keep a plant journal. In your journal, you can write about how your plant is doing, what changes you've noticed, and how you're caring for it.

Documenting your plant's growth is a great way to keep track of its progress and to create a plant log that you can look back on. Plus, it's a fun way to document your plant's journey from a small seedling to a full-grown plant!

FREE PLANT IDENTIFICATION

If you come across a flower that you can't identify, take a picture of it and upload it to the app. Within seconds, you'll be given the plant's name and species. If you're ever curious about what plant is this, you know what app to use!

FREE PLANT CARE GUIDES

If you're looking to become a plant parent, Ploi has an ever-growing list of plant care guides that can help. Our guide is crafted specifically for each plant species, so you can learn everything you need to know about taking care of your plant."

Handwriting a journal entry or even typing our a journal entry takes way too much time. The 3 minute journal is here to change that.

The 3 minute journal lets you journal by using your voice. Simply tap to record, and tap again to finish recording, and then your audio journal entry is saved! The best part is that we also transcribe your audio recording into text, so you have both an audio and text version of your journal entry. The best of both worlds! It's way faster than journaling through traditional methods like handwriting or typing them out, and it's also a BETTER experience. By speaking your journal entries out loud, it almost feels like a mini therapy session, and you feel much more connected to your journaling process.

Journal every single by day with an audio recording for three categories: something annoying, something beautiful, and something you're thankful for. Simple press any of the categories and start recording your journal entry. It's that easy.

Journaling is a great practice to do every day, but handwriting or even typing journals can take way too long. With Soli Audio Journal, you can journal way faster by using your voice and creating audio recordings. You can record your thoughts and journal about your thoughts in a safe space. Simply tap one of the categories to start recording your journal entry, and tap again to stop recording your journal entry. 

Once you stop recording, your journal entries are transcribed to text, so you never have to pick between an audio journal entry or a text journal entry — you get both.

You can use this in any way that you want — at the start of the day to reflect on your previous day, during the day to record your thoughts, or at the end of the day to wind down and to use it as a diary or a journal.

Journaling is a great practice that helps promote mindfulness and healthier living, and the 3 Minute Journal is one of the best ways to journal. Try it out!

"1628586259";"Menstruation Journal";"Your menstrual cycle can say a lot about your health. Understand how to start tracking your menstrual cycle and what to do about irregularities.

Do you know when your last menstrual period began or how long it lasted? If not, it might be time to start paying attention.

Tracking your menstrual cycles can help you understand what's normal for you, time ovulation and identify important changes — such as a missed period or unpredictable menstrual bleeding. While menstrual cycle irregularities usually aren't serious, sometimes they can signal health problems.

What's the menstrual cycle?
The menstrual cycle is the monthly series of changes a woman's body goes through in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy. Each month, one of the ovaries releases an egg — a process called ovulation. At the same time, hormonal changes prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If ovulation takes place and the egg isn't fertilized, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is a menstrual period.

What's normal?
The menstrual cycle, which is counted from the first day of one period to the first day of the next, isn't the same for every woman. Menstrual flow might occur every 21 to 35 days and last two to seven days. For the first few years after menstruation begins, long cycles are common. However, menstrual cycles tend to shorten and become more regular as you age.

Your menstrual cycle might be regular — about the same length every month — or somewhat irregular, and your period might be light or heavy, painful or pain-free, long or short, and still be considered normal. Within a broad range, ""normal"" is what's normal for you.

Keep in mind that use of certain types of contraception, such as extended-cycle birth control pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs), will alter your menstrual cycle. Talk to your health care provider about what to expect.

When you get close to menopause, your cycle might become irregular again. However, because the risk of uterine cancer increases as you age, discuss any irregular bleeding around menopause with your health care provider.

How can I track my menstrual cycle?
To find out what's normal for you, start keeping a record of your menstrual cycle on a calendar. Begin by tracking your start date every month for several months in a row to identify the regularity of your periods.

If you're concerned about your periods, then also make note of the following every month:

End date. How long does your period typically last? Is it longer or shorter than usual?
Flow. Record the heaviness of your flow. Does it seem lighter or heavier than usual? How often do you need to change your sanitary protection? Have you passed any blood clots?
Abnormal bleeding. Are you bleeding in between periods?
Pain. Describe any pain associated with your period. Does the pain feel worse than usual?
Other changes. Have you experienced any changes in mood or behavior? Did anything new happen around the time of change in your periods?"

The app’s data driven approach, life analytics and the machine learning  powering it, mean that it can help you out in a pinch, when you need a quick way to get back into a good headspace. Quantifying your emotions and the causal factors behind them also makes it a great tool for longer term self improvement.

Central to our app and approach are what we call “mindtags” - basically short captures of your emotions and their underlying causes throughout the day. Adding a mindtag takes less than a minute and logging an entry with multiple mindtags takes 1-3 minutes. 

Mindtagging allows us to gain a full picture of you that gets richer and more helpful over time. As you enter more mindtags and your reflection collection grows, details and patterns emerge that would otherwise get lost in the buzz of life. 

And while we’re all about inner peace, pretty pastel colors, and helping you be the best you, we firmly believe regular effort, actionable data and understanding emotional triggers are keys to progress. 

We go beyond simply tracking and documenting you. We give you access to inspiring content that will help you along the road.

WHEN DO I NEED A MOOD DIARY AND TRACKING TOOL?

Mood diary is frequently offered by psychologists and therapists to help us discover facts about ourselves that otherwise slip our attention. You may experience a diagnosed condition like bipolar, OCD, depression, etc. Or you may want to track symptoms of PMS, IMS, PMDD, PPD, or track menstrual cycles. You may have stressful job, like manager reporting to executives or customer facing specialist, which makes you feel exhausted at the end of your long day. You may be on emotional rollercoaster as your partner is making your heart tear apart. Or you may simply be curious to know yourself better. This app may help! Bring your iMoodJournal to your therapist or discuss it with your close friend to maximize its positive impact on your life.

* To get the best out of the app, please keep regular records (preferably 2 – 3 times a day) of your mood with tags and self-portraits for at least 1 – 2 weeks. The Weekly Cycle chart requires several weeks of records to generate meaningful output. We wish you the very best experience with iMoodJournal. Please send us your feedback at support@imoodjournal.com.

"1524934375";"Pandy: Diary, Journal, Mood";"Pandy is a smart personal diary that allows you to keep good memories and neutralize bad ones. You will be able to track emotions, chat on an anonymous social network and work through borther negative situations that bother you. The app will motivate you to journal regularly and form a good habit.

We, the city dwellers, live in a constant stream of information chaos: every day we have to deal with huge volume of news, messages, random spam - and all this is overwhelming for our brains. In such conditions, it is impossible to perceive information in full, much less to properly process it. As a result, the most important things in our life sometimes go unnoticed, as the daily hustle and bustle pushes them into the background.

The Pandy Community invites you to pay attention to the most important person in your life - yourself. Try to journal every day about things that are happening to you and describe what you feel. It is scientifically proven that journaling reduces anxiety and vulnerability to stress, and in the long term, has a positive effect on mental health.

Unlike a paper notebook, Pandy app is always at hand, safely storing your notes and keeping them from prying eyes. If you have never tried keeping a personal diary, don't worry - the in app reminders and tips about what and when to write will help you. This way taking daily notes about your condition will become your daily ritual of self-care, and that's the first step towards a conscious and harmonious life.

Some situations that provoke negative emotions are repeated time and time again. For such cases, Pandy suggests you start using special psychological techniques with proven effectiveness: CBT, desensitization, and many others. Our goal is to help our users recognize and relive the grievances and fears of the past in order to free their minds for exciting new positive experiences.

No one is alone with Pandy. We have put together an active community: in our social network, our users share their joys and struggles, always supporting and helping each other to cope with life's difficulties. All communication in Pandy is completely anonymous, so that every user can share their most honest thoughts and not be afraid that their secrets will be revealed.

We were looking hard for an application that would combine all the necessary steps to maintain person's mental health, and in the end we decided to build it ourselves.

Pandy will make you: 
- keep your important memories, 
- keep a Diary of Gratitude, 
- formulate your wishes so that they come true, 
- notice repetitive patterns in your behavior, 
- work through your past negative experiences, 
- learn psychological life hacks, 
- train mindfulness, 
- get active support, 
- celebrate your achievements and progress, 
- practice positive thinking.

The protection of your personal data is our priority. Pandy is built on the principles of respect, honesty and care. Users' personal records are constantly under their full control, other applications or processes do not have access to your information, and any interaction takes place through encrypted channels.

"1496543978";"Correlate: Health Journal";"Logging your mood, sleep quality, health symptoms can be a PAIN, even with Excel spreadsheets. 

Correlate is a nifty health app that combines the simplicity of todo-lists and the power of data analysis to give you the health app you have always wanted.

// DISCOVER WHAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING FOR YOU

How do you know if your medication, product, or habit is making you feel better?

Whether they are supplements you are consuming, habits you are doing or routines that you are enforcing, this tracker helps you find out what actually works for you…and what isn't. You can now stop wasting money, time, and energy on medication, products, or habit that doesn't help you feel better.

It is a powerful app if you are dealing with:

• General symptoms: fatigue, stress, bad mood, high blood pressure, pain

• Sleep: snoring, low quality sleep, not enough sleep

• Gut Health: bloating, indigestion, acid reflux

• Allergies or intolerances: food intolerances, dust allergy, hay fever

• Mood disorders: stress, anxiety, migraine, headache


// FEATURES

1. Todo-list style
Simple and easy. Did something? Give it a check. If you didn't? Leave it blank. Think about how easy it is to log your item. No-fuss at all.

2. Pretty Bar Graphs - 
What's the point of all the numbers when you can't visualize them. We got you covered. We show you how the remedies influence you positively or negatively through an intuitive visualization.

3. Compare up to 3 Remedies/Items - 
See which supplement, habit or routine helps you the most and which ones aren't. Put up to 3 of them side-by-side and you can easily visualize their effectiveness at a glance.

Edit/Backfill Entries Feel free to create entries for previous days or edit previous entries up to 28 days past.

4. Export your data - 
Your data belongs to you. Export your data as a CSV file when you want to do intense data crunching or just to save it somewhere else.

5. Integration - 
Have an Oura Ring or Fitbit? Connect them to the app to pull your sleep data for analysis.

6. Reminder - 
For busy people.


// HOW TO USE

Think of things you suspect are causing problems or things that might help you become healthier or better (e.g. supplements, medications, activities...).

Examples of self-experiments you can try:

1. Does restricting coffee intake help me sleep better?

2. Does this mood supplement actually help me with my mood disorder/mental health?

3. Does taking my pre-workout help me perform better in the gym?

4. What food is causing me to have bloating/indigestion?



// MORE ON SLEEP

Sleep is underrated. Many of us are not prioritizing sleep enough. This app gives you the power to optimize your sleep. Use the sleep data from the sleep tracker of your choice and experiment with different bedtime routines. Make changes and log them to see what is helping you and what isn't. Connect your Oura Ring if you have one.

Who knows? You might find that using a cheap and simple eye mask can drastically improve the quality of your sleep? This health journal is going to help you find out what truly works for you.


// DISCLAIMER: 

Correlate, a health & life journal, is just one of the many medical apps in the store. It is not a substitute for your doctor visits, and it does not provide a professional diagnosis for your symptoms. However, it can help you and your doctor track your health and better understand your symptoms based on correlation."

"479013889";"DBT Diary Card & Skills Coach";"DBT Diary Card is the only DBT iPhone app designed and created by a licensed and DBT intensively trained psychologist.

Highlights of version 3.0:

+ graphing data across time
+ on device PDF viewing
+ daily reminders
+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.

Read what our actual users say:

""***** Best DBT app available!!!
Simply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!"" - iTunes US Review

""***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!"" - iTunes Sweden Review

""***** Perfect! Worth the money!"" - iTunes US Review

As an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!

A DBT app can have 3 parts: 

- A reference manual
- A behavior tracker
- A skills coach

DBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.

+ PDF generation
+ Notification Pane support
+ Password protection
+ Advanced text editing
+ Media playback

What DBT Diary Card has to offer:

- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.

- Emotions. All the ""basic"" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.

- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.

- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. 

- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.

- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. 

- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.

"1469529142";"TeleSonoUroflow Bladder Diary";"TeleSonoUroflow is available free on the iPhone for people who may have urinary voiding difficulties. One of the ways of assessing these individuals is to do a test known as uroflowmetry. This requires a visit to the clinic to urinate into the uro-flowmeter.
TeleSonoUroflow is an App to make recording at home when one feels the natural urge to
urinate. The App records the sound of the urine hitting the water in the toilet bowl and other details. Send these to your doctor who sets up a Telemedicine/Virtual care visit.
This is convenient, time-saving, more natural than institution-based testing, offers several individual data sets that may be more representative than one single test. It is very cheap and makes no mess in the doctor's office! Perhaps one of the strongest plusses is that the patient is involved in his own care."

"490507850";"Cash Journal";"The app which will keep you from losing track of your expenditures! On the go, on vacation, business trips, household expenses, we’re always spending money – large and small amounts. It’s easy to lose track, a credit card’s limit is quickly reached and when that happens, it is always at the most inconvenient time. Or you were on a business trip and find a receipt in your bag many weeks later, that you would have needed to submit long before – unfortunately, these things start adding up. Therefore, there are many reasons why it is important to keep on top of your daily expenses. And for that, this app is your perfect partner:

- enter your earnings and expenditures in a flash
- manage as many credit cards, debit cards, cash and other payment methods as you wish
- current balances are always easily accessible without complicated retrieval
- set up your own cost types or simply use the ones already included – for an immediate start without the need for further preparation 
- export data to continue working on it in a spreadsheet

This app was created with the goal of providing the best possible overview of expenditures together with a minimal amount of time spent entering data – because only then is today’s good intention to keep better track of your expenses of long-term feasibility.

On the welcome screen you will see all your entries in the main account. You can sort these by date, cost type, and payment type. You decide the order in which the cost types and payment methods are displayed. For example, if you find the cost of fuel for your car to be the most important, then simply establish that these entries are to be displayed first.

From this same screen you can make a new entry, as well as take a look at the details of already existing entries and edit them, if necessary.

When making a new entry simply enter:
- date
- cost type
- payment method
- amount
If you like, you can also enter a short or detailed text. Now you already have a solid basis for a lasting management of your expenses.

You can see the current balances of your payment methods on the second tab. Without your having to refresh or do anything after submitting a new entry, their up-to-date status will always be clearly displayed.

Under settings you can choose your cost types and payment methods. The cost types already include a standard sign, so that you don’t have to pay attention to a plus or minus when making an entry. If you would like to correct an entry, for example because you exchanged something, simply use the sign change button when making the correction. Add as many and as detailed cost types as you need.

You can also individually select your payment types. It is completely up to you which and how many payment types you would like to manage.

In addition to the constantly up-to-date balances, using the analysis function you can decide on a time frame for which you want to be shown the sums per cost type or payment method or show a comparison of earnings to expenditures. For example, on the last day of the month, the sum of your expenses from the 1st to the 31st. You can also use the export function to change entries and analyses into files that you can then make further use of or archive in a spreadsheet or other suitable program.  

You can use this app in German, English, or simplified Chinese.

With this app, unknowingly surpassed credit limits and unwelcome surprises at the end of the month due to unexpectedly high expenditures are history!"

tapdiary is focused on making it easy to keep a diary.

Above all, the ability to keep a diary with just a tap is a feature that clearly differentiates tapdiary from other diary apps.

You can keep a diary every day, so you can feel your personal growth.
Increased self-esteem
Mental stability

Writing a diary has many benefits, but the problem is that it is hard to keep up.

Yuma Uchida, the developer of the application, was also someone who could not keep a diary.

He sometimes felt self-loathing because of his inability to keep a diary.

That is why he developed tapdiary, an app that allows you to keep a diary even when you are tired.

As the name suggests, this app allows you to write a diary with just a tap.

You can choose your mood of the day and a template for your diary will appear, and you can write your diary just by selecting the template."

"1641826811";"1year Later Diary";"It's a diary application to yourself a year from now. 
Since you write with the intention of not being able to read it again for a year, you become ""subconsciously"" aware of what you wrote.
By writing down your goals, what you want to do, and who you want to be, you will be more aware of them throughout the year.
If you are strongly aware of them, your life and behavior will gradually change toward them.
In other words, it is a diary for your personal growth.

You don't have to write every day.
You won't mind if there are days you didn't write.
You would rather more interested in the days you wrote.
There is also a countdown function that displays the number of days until the next time you can read your diary.

You can only be read back one day per year.
It can be read back for exactly one day exactly one year after it was written and the same day each year thereafter.
For example, if you write a diary on July 21, 2022, it will appear only on the same day each year, such as July 21,2023, July 21,2024, and so on.
You can only read it back for that one day (24 hours).
As you read diaries you wrote one, two, or three years ago, you write to yourself one, two, or three years in the future.

Basically Free, No Ads
Some options are available for a fee, but it is free of charge as a diary.
No annoying ads will appear on the writing page. 
Ads will only appear on the calendar and the settings page.

 ""Questions for You"" assists your diary.
It can display questions that will help you look at yourself objectively and be positive on your life.
You can read the questions about twice a week.
For example, 
""What habits do you want to develop over the next year?"",
""What do you want to quit now?""
"" What do you want to improve over the next year? "".
There are more than 200 questions.
For a fee (3$), you can read the questions every day.
In such the case, more in-depth questions will appear. 
Care should be taken before bedtime so as not to overthink and lose sleep. 
Sensitive people may need to be especially careful.
You can also choose not to read the questions in the settings.

Diary data is stored in iCloud, so you can share your diary with multiple devices(iPhone and iPad).

"1186753097";"Perspective, a mindful journal";"This here, then, is a safe place for you to be honest and get in touch with yourself again, for too often we allow ourselves to be agitated by everything around us and too rarely do we pause to help our mind catch up.

It's time to slow down, spend some time thinking about our lives and try to learn from our own experiences. What better way then to simply engage in a conversation with your future and past self?

Perspective is a unique journaling experience that captures your thoughts, moods, and interests over time and prompts reflection and insight to help you make personal discoveries and learn about yourself.

We hope it'll help you make better decisions in your life, allow you to better manage your anxieties and those moments when you feel low. We hope it'll help you rediscover yourself and fall in love again with the awesome person that you are. 

We started out with this big idea that we want to help people, we want to add our small contribution to making the world just a little bit better. And for that, this app absolutely needed to be completely free. It's tricky, it makes it so much harder to find the time to improve it, but some of the feedback we've got from people telling us it's made their life better... it's worth it. We're not gonna be the #1 app in the store, we're not gonna be the best app out there, just because we don't have the resources to do so. But we're honest in our intentions and we think it's vital that not only the people who can pay should have access to a tool that could potentially improve their mental health. That being said, though, all our users have iPhones... so, that might not be the best logic. Regardless, it's free just because it's the right thing to do.

We hope you enjoy it."

It also helps me very well to connect my daily well-being with my daily actions, my sleep and my symptoms.
Using tags makes it easy for me to capture these things.

These functions are at your side:
 - Choose a suitable emoji for your personal well-being every day.
 - Likewise for your sleep
 - Personally create tags and add them to your days.
 - Keep a journal of your personal thoughts and short words.
 - Write down what was particularly good or bad for each day.
 - Add Apple Health data to your diary.
 - Complete and detailed evaluation of your sleep.
 - See in the calendar when you felt how and when you added which day.
 - See in extensive statistics how your well-being, your sleep and everything else has developed.

Moody was developed in close cooperation with a psychotherapist to give you the simplest possible yet professional diary"

"1658510054";"Teeth Whitening Diary";"I'm doing Whitening, but I need to know how effective it is...
Do you have such a thing?

You can measure the effect of Whitening and record it with this app.

About Whitening
Recently, Whitening has become popular among all people.
If you have beautiful teeth, your impression will change drastically.

Home whitening has become popular recently.
Home whitening is a method of wearing a unique mouthpiece and Whitening teeth at home for several days.

It looks easy, but there are problems.

That is, It is hard to measure the effectiveness.

It takes days for Whitening. By the time it's done, you'll forget the original color of your teeth and never know just how beautiful they become.

This app solves such problems.


 Basic usage of this app

(1) First, Take a picture. You can launch the camera directly from this app. Close up as much as possible and shoot your teeth in a bright place.
(2) Next, get the tooth color. Tap the center of your tooth. Then you can get the tooth color.
(3) Press the Analyze button, and the app compares the tooth color you have gotten with the shade guide. You can check which color is closest to one of the 15 colors.
(4) If you don't trust the app's program, tap it directly. Then, you can change the shade guide to which colors work best.



Main feature of the app 1 (daily chart)

The app has a graph-displaying function.
Using this, you can visualize how the tooth color and rank changed daily.

Tapping directly on the graph, you can also check the tooth photo for that day.

By doing this, you can see how the tooth has changed directly in the picture.



Main feature of the app 2 (Checking photos in the calendar)

A calendar function.
The calendar displays a tooth mark on the day photo was taken.
When you tap this tooth mark, the app will display a picture of the tooth at the bottom of the screen.

The function is convenient when you compare pictures of teeth by displaying them only for the date you want to look at.


Main feature of the app 3 (Adding users)

You can add users from the settings screen.

The function is convenient in such situations,
?when a dentist wants to check the teeth of multiple patients
?When you wish to record by the app each with your partner or family
?When you want to record the upper and lower teeth separately


About the shade guide
This app uses a shade guide to measure your whitening results.

A shade guide is a guide with a row of tooth models of different whiteness.
We have prepared 15 different colors.

Three is the same level as an actor.
Eight is the average for the general public.

- Added images - photos and other images can be attached to reports.
- Offline support - Sites with limited connectivity are not a problem as the app continues to perform seamlessly off-line. Data captured is saved on the device and synchronized to the cloud as soon as a connection becomes available.

This app is based on the BULLET JOURNAL (Bullet Journal), a daily activity plan that breaks down from an annual activity plan and a monthly activity plan and manages the schedule.

Every activity has an Objective / Target / Strategy / to schedule. This app starts by setting Objective / Target / Strategy / in addition to the Bullet Journal Key.

Usage is
1. Learn about Bullet Journal and set up your own keys for up to 12 items. For example, tasks and task completion. You can modify the initial registration at any time, but tap Save.
2. Next, set up to 12 items of Objective / Target / Strategy / for your activity. For example, you can always modify your initial goals, such as work goals or personal diet goals, but don't forget to save.

4. On the Log screen, enter Key settings, Objective / Target / Strategy / selection, Task, Event, Memo, Info type selection, and the content of the activity schedule.
Up to three Marks can be set by the user.
 Also, you can select whether or not to temporarily display each LogView. The default should be Display.
In addition, the entered log is migrated from the first FutureLog, that is, the level of the annual plan, to MonthlyLog's monthly plan and then to DailyLog (detailed plan and schedule).
When migrating, select the FutureLog, MonthlyLog, and DailyLog flags Y / N, and enter the year, month, and day as required, and then save.
You can select the date setting for DailyLog by tapping the calendar date at the top of the Log screen or tapping the field.
5. Each Log is managed on a case-by-case basis and can be viewed with FutureLogView, MonthlyLogView, DailyLogView and AllLogView.

"1450726202";"Epilepsy Journal";"Epilepsy Journal is an app which allows you to quickly document daily variables concerning your epilepsy, such as seizure triggers, types etc.  The information you provide is organized into easy to read graphs which allow for quick visualization of your individual epilepsy trends and patterns overtime.  This app can serve as a valuable communication aid,  by allowing you to generate a straightforward and professional report which can be shared with your physicians.

In general, we hope that this App will allow you to: 

1) track epilepsy trends and patterns over time
2) objectively determine effectiveness of your epilepsy treatments 
3) improve success of doctors appointments


Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which affects 1 in 26 people worldwide.  It can have a relapsing, remitting, and unpredictable course.  Treatment of epilepsy can be frustrating, and has been accurately referred to as being similar to the popular “whack a mole” game.  Whether your epilepsy is mild or severe, refractory or controlled, it is critical to objectively and consistently monitor certain factors such as number of seizures, seizure triggers, AED drug or ketone levels, and other vital information.    Keeping a detailed epilepsy journal will allow you to quickly notice any changes to your epilepsy, as well as provide you with impartial evidence as to whether your epilepsy treatment is truly effective or losing effectiveness over time.  

App Features:
- Easy to use
- Record seizure details (as much or as little as you like)
- Visual representation of data 
- Generate reports
- Keep track of medications with reminders
- Customizable to fit your individual epilepsy
- Full version completely FREE

 

Our Story/ Mission:

Our daughter Olivia is our inspiration for this app.  Olivia has a refractory and severe epilepsy which began at age 1. Once Olivia´s epilepsy started we were advised by our physicians to keep a written epilepsy journal, in order to track trends and treatment response overtime.    Although the journal was helpful in allowing us to objectively monitor the effectiveness of her epilepsy treatments, it was very time consuming and tended to be disorganized; As well, the hundreds of pages of notes did not help us when it became most critical to quickly and accurately summarize months worth of seizure history,  (for example during emergency  hospital  visits or follow up appointments).  During our experience navigating the neurology health care system, we found accurate and effective communication to be a key factor in successfully working with doctors and achieving ideal seizure control.   
We created this app as a free and simple way to monitor your epilepsy; track trends and patterns, objectively determine effectiveness of seizure treatment overtime, and improve success of doctors appointments.
Since epilepsy contains dozens of ever changing variables, we decided to organize data into simple visuals which demonstrate seizure trends and patterns over a time span of months to years.  
Our epilepsy journal allows you to quickly document all the important variables concerning your epilepsy, and to generate a simple and easy to read report to print out or email your doctors.  
We hope that this app enables you to grasp a better understanding of your own individual epilepsy, and that it empowers you as an effective communicator and advocate within your epilepsy health care team."

With this app you can keep a record of how much you drink and how often you pee, which will help the doctor to find the cause of incontinence.

We will regularly ask you to check if the exercises work so that you can fill in an experience report at the end of the program. The exercises are non-medicated and try to improve the symptoms in a gentle way.

Use graphs to understand the impact of your drink habitudes on the incontinence. Use weekly reports to assess the improvements.

Written journals are great, but tend to be factual. Audio journals on the other hand are more emotional and include narratives. Also, voicing our emotions and experiences is something that we rarely do, despite it helping us reduce negative emotions and building our confidence. It's a great mindfulness technique.

Days make today.

What you ate and what you drank, what kind of day it was, stack up and check out your spare time.

First, take pictures of food before eating. It doesn't have to be taken. After a pleasant meal time, tap the + button to record your meal.

You can record food photos, meal types, meal satisfaction, calories, and a comment. It's okay to select only the items you want and record them.

It is said that the daily water intake is about 2 liters. Let's record each drink of water. You can also increase or decrease your daily target amount. Once you've recorded it, you can see how much of your daily goal you've achieved.

The daily record is also displayed on the calendar. You can check at a glance when you recorded it weekly or monthly. Seeing the records displayed one by one on the calendar, you can feel proud of yourself who has been consistent.

Keeping records, by itself, makes sense. Let's make up our mind today by checking whether the past was good or bad. Even if the commitments of the past were a little bit different from what you thought, you just need to rebalance from now.

There is a space at the top of the home screen where you can write a simple message. I think it would be good if you write down a sentence that can be a reminder, such as your commitment or your usual thoughts.

Day Made wants to help you make the day you think of. If you have any comments on improvements or additional features while using Day Made, please send them to 'feedback.plum@gmail.com'. Welcome anytime.

WHY I BUILT MYTEAPAL:
As a tea enthusiast for more than four years, I always wished there were a way to record my tea journey, including all the teas I tasted, teawares I collected, brewing methods I used, and feelings I sensed.

I then found that tea journaling was the best way to do this, but after trying a few paperback tea journals and other tea apps, I was disappointed. None of them felt right to me.

I wanted to create an all-in-one tea app that made it easy for tea drinkers to catalogue their teas and teawares, find their favorite ways of brewing, record their thoughts, and share with their tea friends.

So I created MyTeaPal. I hope through this app, we can all become more mindful about what teas we have tasted, how we brewed them, and how they made us feel. Wishing you the best with your tea journey!

"1502570695";"Travel Diary: Trip Tracker";"Make your life a diary of places
Automatically while your iPhone is in your pocket

The travel diary logs the places where you stayed, their location and the duration of your stay. Then it looks for the photos you took there, checks in Wikipedia for interesting information such as castles or churches in the area and the new diary entry in ready. Without even opening the app. And if you feel thirsty or gnawing hunger, it even helps you to get to the nearest café or restaurant.


Over time you will get a nice and informative travel diary. Only for you. Because the information will never leave your phone. At most on your Apple Watch. So you can always check where you've been hanging around since installing the app.

And even better: it also helps you to go back there. Have you ever been on a mountain or in the forest and found a nice place or enjoyed the view? And on the hike next year you can’t remember how to get there?

Well, Travel Diary offers you two ways to get to any place it shows you - regardless of whether it is a diary entry that was recorded for you in the background or a point of interest that you want in your area. Every location shown in the app has a button for a directional compass and for navigation.

Navigation uses the power of Apple Maps to give you the best routing experience you can have on iPhone. The wheel doesn't have to be reinvented, right? ;)

The compass determines the direction to this destination and displays a bright red arrow that points exactly to this location.

On the Apple Watch you get the most useful parts of the iPhone app, optimized for the smaller display. A list of the places you have been, with each day of the week in a clear color for better distinction. And either with the red compass arrow or with Apple Maps you will be guided there safely

Have fun with the app and I hope it is as useful for you as it is for me"

Use Parazute on your own, or together with a network that you invite to the app.
Parazute uses scientifically validated methods, and the data can be used together with your healthcare professional.

GET PEACE OF MIND WITH A NETWORK OF PARAZUTERS

When struggling with mental illness, it’s only natural that you can find it challenging to reach out for help when you are mentally free-falling. To help you, Parazute deploys support from your network when your mental status negatively changes. Early support - even with minor changes in mental status can prevent hospitalization, self-damage, or even more unnecessary fatal tragedies.

Parazute can be used for all mental disorders where support from the social network is sometimes needed to move forward, such as ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline, dementia, depression, addiction disorders, OCD, PTSD, psychoses, self-harm, schizophrenia, eating disorders, stress, etc.

WITH PARAZUTE, RELATIVES MAY STAY CALM

As relatives, there’s a lot of stress and anxiety at stake every day, and you’re desperately trying to help your loved ones. With Parazute, you’ll be notified should a mentally ill friend or a family member need your support. 

HOW PARAZUTE WORKS

The Parazute app reports the mental health status to the network based on a few daily inputs. It is less than one minute of effort for the patient. In case of adverse development in mental status – the self-selected “Parazuters” made up of family, friends, and even caregivers that the patient already trust today, get notified that the patient need some love.

Parazute cannot diagnose mental illnesses nor assess the relative level of a given mental state, for example, severe, moderate, or mild depression.

Parazute is also not a treatment but only early detection of a change in mental state and then activation of support from the network.

In case of indication of self-harm, always seek help actively.

Parazute is developed by patients, relatives, and mental healthcare professionals in close collaboration with the Danish National Association for Mental Health.

 
OUR SOCIAL COMMITMENT IS MORE THAN JUST WORDS

Parazute has been built from the ground up in a true co-creation spirit. Every employee at Parazute has hands-on experience within the mental illness field, whether it’s being a patient, a relative, or a healthcare professional – simply put, it’s a job requirement.

We’re committed to donating 30% of our monthly basis fees directly towards scientific research to actively help the study of digital psychiatry and the emotional well-being of relatives.

We'd love to hear about your Parazute experience: Reach out to us if you have any feedback or questions: E-mail - info@parazute.com

"1453330205";"Grapefruit Journal";"Let's not lie to each other. This app ain't gonna solve all your problems.

I don't think any app is gonna do that. If you think your answers are one app away, then I have some land on the moon to sell you.

Not that this app isn't helpful. It's helped plenty of people, in fact. It all depends what you need and what you need to meet that need.

Here's what this app can do: give you a place to write a journal, track your moods, emotions, habits and anything else you can think of. It's very flexible so you can make it into whatever you need it to be.

It will also do some analysis on your data and give you some charts and graphs and data breakdowns. Those might help you spot patterns in your life. Or they might not. Who knows? Life is chaos.

We also don't use any tracking scripts, or collect your data, or show ads, or up-sell you with recurring payments or any of the other things that apps these days drive us crazy with. 

This is a place of calm, okay? Your place of calm.

Or maybe not. Maybe it's not for you. Well, we've priced it low enough that you don't have to feel guilty if you try it out and don't stick with it.

You're human, we're human, life is hard.

But, look, there is some actual reason this app does what it does. In short:

JOURNAL - one of the best things you can do for your mental health is keep a journal. They help you understand your thoughts, reduce stress, and many other benefits.

TRACK STUFF - Say you're struggling with a particular emotion (e.g. depression, or anger) and trying to identify the triggers. Wouldn't it be helpful to read back your journal for just the days when you felt that emotion? What about two emotions? What happened on days when you were sad and angry? You can look at those days as well. Though ... maybe you won't want to.

LOOK AT PRETTY CHARTS - Do you know how often you have a good day? How about days of the week? Or most common emotions? Getting some data back can help you make changes.

CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING - There are as many ways to use it as there are people! Add questions that are specific to your own unique experience. Change the emotions/feelings list to reflect how you describe your feelings, or replace it entirely with a list of different cheeses.

That's it, really. That's our terrible pitch. If it appeals to you, great! We're only in this to help people. Otherwise, good luck in whatever journey you're on!"

"1516132622";"Pencil Journal - Digital Diary";"~~~ Pencil Journal - Your Digital Handwriting Diary & Gratitude Journal ~~~
Keeping a journal has been scientifically proven to reduce stress, improve your mood and increase your overall levels of happiness, amongst a host of other benefits. And this is especially true when you handwrite your entries due to the increase in reflective thinking, making this one of the key main benefits of the Pencil Journal app.

Furthermore, to get the most out of journaling it's best to make it a habit that you can stick to - ideally every day - even if only for a short duration each time. However, we never want you to feel like you have nothing to write about, which is why the app includes 50+ journal prompts and 100+ motivational quotes to get you inspired and ready to start writing. That way, whether you have just 2 minutes - or 20 - you will always be able to put pen to pad and start reaping the benefits that journaling has to offer.

Read on to find out more about these two main benefits:

~~~ Handwriting Journal Benefits ~~~
Making a digital journal is convenient and saves on continuously buying new notebooks and pens, but handwriting your entries is said to be more therapeutic, better at improving your memory and helpful to increase reflective thinking. So which are you to choose?

It's a question we've long struggled with, and we could never find something that quite fit both camps, so we only went and built it ourselves! The result is Pencil Journal - Your Digital Handwritten Diary & Gratitude Journal.

You can use your Apple Pencil or finger to handwrite journal entries or make cute sketches. You can also type entries for when you are in a rush, or when your handwriting is having a bad hair day! Or combine them both in a single entry to add handwritten highlights and flourishes to typed text. Your choice. No rules.

~~~ The Benefits of Using Journaling Prompts ~~~
It's all well good deciding to start a journal, but what to write about? It can be hard to come up with new topics every day, and this can lead you to stop to journaling altogether, which would be a real shame given all the scientific benefits discussed above.

Luckily this is a problem we addressed too. We included over 50 journaling prompts to get you started so you never need be short on ideas again! Less time thinking about what to write = more time to write = more benefits from journaling.

Oh, and if you are already a pro and know exactly what you want to write about, then no worries! We also have a large freestyle space available to use however you want, complete with optional dotted, lined or blank backgrounds. And of course you can use your Apple Pencil to draw here, as well as typing too. Plus, you can even add photos to decorate your page or visually document your day.

Each daily page also comes with a motivational quote to further inspire you; over 100 are included in the app at launch.

~~~ Features ~~~

* Use your Apple Pencil or finger to write/draw/sketch into the journal
* Add photos to visually document your day / decorate your journal
* Import/export data to AirDrop, Files, Mail, iCloud, DropBox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc
* Use the keyboard to type entries, add emojis, etc
* 50+ journaling prompts to get you started, with more to be added in future updates.
* Add your own journaling prompts, customized entirely to you
* Freestyle journaling space for when you just want to express yourself without any constraints
* 100+ motivational quotes to inspire you
* Built-in calendar to easily navigate between journal entries; it also shows which days you have successfully added to your journal, helping you to keep the chain and sustain the habit of journaling
* 100% privacy guaranteed and no account/email sign-up required; all data is stored safely in your device

~~~ Conclusion ~~~
So what are you waiting for? Start reaping the benefits of handwritten journaling today, only with Pencil Journal - Your Digital Handwriting Diary & Gratitude Journal."
"1518906813";"Flow Journal: Writing a Diary";"Keep a journal and reflect. Writing is fundamentally system of organizing thoughts, and keeping a journal helps organize the mind. Taking time to write your thoughts will help you make sense of the world, your feelings and your motivations. How does it really work? Quite simply by freeing our mind from the job of processing that experience. As a result, it has been shown to improve our mood and leave us to sleep better.

There's no single magic moment. Building a habit to reflect every day through a journal entry, even if it is brief, yields many benefits over time. Similar to meditation, scientific studies have showed that it can boost mindfulness, communication skills, and working memory. It also helps heal wounds faster, by labeling them and acknowledging them, and ultimately making sense of difficult experiences. Think of it as ""brain drain"", a way to expel your energy buildup that muddies our subconscious.

Features:
- Daily reminders to reflect.
- Organize your day with themes.
- Track themes and notice patterns over time.
- Discover which themes are correlated, and which are not.
- Ads free.
- Complete privacy. Your data is in the safest possible place - in your hands.

The application differs from the Graphic Diary program in that you can create a PDF book from journal entries.

This is a diary-keeping software. You can enter daily activities in the diary entries. The appearance of the entries can be greatly changed. You can format a plain text - for example, the font type or font size. You can change the background of the text by changing the color of the text highlight. You can add different images to the text, and you can change the size of these shapes later.

The most important addition is that the background to the entries can be self-designed. You can draw different shapes there. You can draw lines, circles, squares, arrows, and so on. You can simply draw random lines and choose the appropriate line thickness. Or, spray paint in the background of the diary entry. Background drawing can be applied in the diary for up to four A4 pages.

Entries in the diary are stored in the application documentary folder. You can also save documents yourself in a selected location on the storage medium.

The diary has its own panel where you can use date and navigation controls. You can navigate to different days that are listed in the date control."

This app helps you control your diet and eat healthier, by making it easy to track what you eat.

"1644008112";"TwoDaysAgo Diary - for memory";"Remembering two days ago  
improves your memory
and helps you cherish your life.

This diary helps improve your memory by habit of remembering two days ago.
Remembering what happened two days ago is said to be brain activating and anti-aging.
Always aware of today, yesterday, and two days ago, you will cherish your precious daily life.

You can compare the two diaries.

There are spaces to write about today and to write about two days ago on the same screen.
And the diary written on that day and the other written two days later remembering that day are both readable and can be compared on the same screen.
For example, when you write your diary on January 1, the January 1 column and the December 30 column are on the same screen.
When you read back your diary of January 1, the column written on January 1 and the other written on January 3 remembering January 1 are on the same screen.

""Match Point""  :Score how far the two diaries match.

Match Point is also provided to determine the degree of agreement between the two diaries(written on that day and written two days later remembering that day).
If there are more matches between the two diaries, you will get higher points.
The perfect score is 100 points.

""Continue Point"" :Support to keep writing.

In order to keep you motivated to write diaries, Continue Point system is supplied.
You can earn higher points by writing a series of diaries.
Writing a lot of things in your diary will also get you more points.
If you take a break from writing, points will be deducted based on the number of days you missed.

""Quotes & Sayings"" :Support to keep writing.

When you write a diary in succession, today's quotes and sayings will be displayed.
We have selected quotes from historical figures and celebrities, as well as good sayings that can make your life more positive.
You can only read it when you write consecutively; if you miss a day, you have to write the next two days in a row to read it.
It is free for one month only. After that it will appear indefinitely for a fee of about $2.

""Three Good Things"" :Support to keep writing and for your positive attitude

We provide a template (fixed phrase) called ""Three Good Things 1. 2. 3.""
It is recommended that you use this to write down three good or positive thoughts of the day.
This is a psychological technique called ""Three Good Things,"" which has been proven to be useful for increasing happiness and improving depression.

""Questions for you"" :Support for your positive attitude

We can display questions that will help you look at yourself objectively and be positive on your life.
You can read the questions around twice a week.
For example, 
""What habits do you want to develop over the next year?"", 
""What do you want to quit now?"",
"" What do you want to improve over the next year? "".
There are more than 200 questions.
For a fee (3$), you can read those questions every day.
In such the case, more in-depth questions will appear. 
Care should be taken before bedtime so as not to overthink and lose sleep. 
Sensitive people may need to be especially careful.

You can also write about yesterday,
if it is difficult to write about two days ago.
By setting, you can also write yesterday's diary.
If you are not accustomed to writing about two days ago, it is recommended that you write yesterday's diary at the same time at first.
In that case, on the same screen, there are columns for writing diaries for today, yesterday, and two days ago.
When you read them, you can compare the diaries you wrote that day, one day later, and two days later.

Basically Free, No Ads

Some options are available for a fee, but it is free of charge as a diary.
No annoying ads will appear on the writing page. Ads will only appear on the calendar and the settings page.
Can use multiple devices
Diary data is stored in iCloud, so you can share your diary with multiple devices(iPhone and iPad).

"1601908803";"MettaDate Journal";"Are you looking for a lasting, healthy love but keep choosing the wrong people?

How are you supposed to find the right person with so many options out there? And how can you trust yourself to recognize a compatible match and ditch the duds?

The MettaDate Journal app will help you to develop the habit of checking in with yourself after a date.  It's a practical tool to help you intentionally navigate the dating process with more confidence and increased self-awareness. 

It is inspired by the book, ""The Mindful Dating Journal: Find a Healthy Love that Lasts,"" by Lauren Smith & Christy Maxey, MC.

Give yourself the time and space to make a decision you can feel good about. In time, you will start to recognize what compatibility looks like to you and what things actually aren’t as important as you thought in a partner.

Here are some other benefits of regularly journaling after a date with the MettaDate Journal:
- Become a more efficient dater & recognize red flags asap.
- Escape unhealthy dating patterns that are keeping you stuck.
- Establish and enforce your boundaries when it comes to dating.
- Tap into helpful messages from your body and emotions.
- Embrace vulnerability while building self-esteem.
- Feel confident in your ability to choose a healthy partner.

This time, dating is different. YOU are in charge of your dating success.

*How It Works*

It’s simple: Date, reflect, repeat!

Whenever you come home from a date, preferably within the next 24 hours, sit down with the MettaDate Journal App to pause. Reflect on all aspects of your experience before, during, and after the date, answering each question as consciously as possible. With the clarity gained through this process, make a balanced choice about whether or not you want to go out on another date with the person. 

Repeat the process! Use the MettaDate Journal to log each new date, including additional dates with the same person. 

It's fascinating to watch how your experience with someone can evolve over several dates. Revisit your previous Journal entries every so often, sending yourself love for the ups and downs you've grown through. When viewed relative to each other, you can start to get a sense of what a good conversation feels like, what a healthy connection looks like, and what compatibility means to you. 

Prioritize yourself while making wise decisions to find the healthy love you deserve. Think of it like dating self-care."

Documenting a patient’s time in ICU helps them and their relatives to 'make sense' of what has happened.The majority of patients have little or no memory of their time in ICU. The diary can help them to piece together events to better understand what happened and how unwell they have been. Keeping a diary helps patients to sort troubling memories from reality. This improves mental health and aids physical recovery and may also reduce the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The diary can be printed and presented to the patient at an appropriate time in their recovery. The printed version includes photos, a glossary of terms and contact information.

less stressed and better able to cope both on the mat and off."" - Dr. Richard Kent, Author at writingathletes.com
 
As athletes, our identity is tied to our sport and training, competing, and managing life with serious goals is challenging.

From day to day life, dreams, motivations, and a sense of progress is easy to lose.

At the end of the day, we only have ourselves to keep us accountable to our goals and aspirations, and we need a way to process our inner voice at every step of the way.

The Athlete’s Journal is your tool for processing the emotions and thoughts that come with dedicating yourself to be your best in a sport and life. 

It’s a place to plan, reflect, and analyze your days, competitions, workouts, wins, shortcomings, work, school, and anything else you’re going through.

By writing, you can make sense of all the emotions in your mind, plan ahead for the future, and look back on prior weeks, months, and years to be reminded of all your progress and learnings.

The app features: 
- Daily journaling throughout the day with prompts specific to athletes
- Goal setting guide to plan out your big dreams, visions, and objectives for the season(s)
- Calendar to filter, search, and look back through all your daily entries, workouts, and races
- Personal trends analysis that shows your patterns in sleep, mood, workout results, nutrition, and more

All your information is stored securely locally on your phone with no requirement of an account, email, or any data collection. This journal is simple and with one objective, to harness your inner voice and hold yourself accountable day in and day out to become the best you can be in sport and life.
 
Research has shown that writing can help any athlete:
- reduce stress and anxiety
- increase self-awareness
- sharpen mental skills
- promote genuine psychological insight
- advance creative inspiration and insight
- strengthen coping abilities

** say hi **
I created The Athlete’s Journal because I’ve experienced first hand the benefits of an athlete’s journal. As an athlete, I’ve journaled consistently for over 3 years and have seen the growth it has brought me within my sport of cycling. I want to help other dedicated athletes become the best they can so I created this app. I’m always looking forward to feedback, and working hard to improve the app so I encourage you to drop me a line at dfonyo@gmail.com
Happy training!

WHY JOURNAL?
1. Track your development
Life happens, and it can happen fast. Sometimes we don't stop to consider our surroundings and what is happening to us right now. We are unable to observe the incremental advancement we are making in our own life. So what occurs? One day, you wake up in the future with no memory of how you got there.  Writing in a daily journal enables you to track your development through time, enabling you to identify your strengths and areas for improvement. 

2. Reduce Stress
Writing down your thoughts enables you to recognize stress-inducing thoughts and beliefs that can be distortions of reality.   Journaling lets you work through your anxious feelings and obsessive worries before you descent into rumination and stress. You obtain a more realistic outlook on life when you consider how likely the worst-case situation is. 

3. Deepen your self-discovery
Imagine yourself as a puzzle where each day brings a new piece or design to light. Journaling offers a necessary pause in order to reestablish our connection to ourselves and rediscover who we are. We discover our preferences, discomforts, worries, likes, and dreams when we write. 
We are always changing. By keeping a journal, we may listen to ourselves, observe these changes, and simply learn to know ourselves much better.

4. Improve your memory
Writing in a journal is a fantastic method to keep track of important events and stages in your life.  The Reticular Activating System is a group of cells that are stimulated when you write. Your mind then prioritizes whatever it is that you are focusing on and engages in a more thorough processing of it. Writing brings information to the foreground and signals to the brain that it is important to pay attentive attention.  You communicate to your brain the importance of your words when you write.


APP FEATURES:
PHOTOS - Make your daily journal more memorable all at no cost. You can incorporate photos from your phone library.
FUN STATS - Easily track your mood over time with easy to read charts and fun highlights like streaks and happiest months.
EMOJIS & MOODS - Assign color coded emojis to your daily notes and easily gauge how you are feeling at a glance.  You can also specify which mood you are in at the moment.
SAFE & PRIVATE - You have the option of protecting all your entries with a passcode.
iCLOUD SUPPORT - No need to worry about losing your entries with automatic iCloud backups.
MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES - Specially curated quotes give you a mental boost and inspiration.
CALENDAR VIEW - Jump to any day in the past and explore your state of mind on that day.
REMINDERS - Your can set reminders to make sure you are consistently logging your thoughts."

Keep track of the results in your digital science journal. Are the toys speeding by too quickly? No problem. Record videos in slow motion! The Ramps Journal offers scaffolds for children as they document their own science experiments on force and motion.

Features
• Supports real-world experiments with ramps
• Captures slow-motion videos of objects in motion
• Charts results of experiments over time
• Aligns with research-based early science learning trajectories
• No in-app purchases
• No advertising

This app is designed for children to to strengthen their science investigation skills and explore the concepts of force and motion as they:
• Describe the speed of an object using words such as faster and slower.
• Describe how an object’s motion changed, slowed down, stopped, or changed direction after bumping into something.
• Understand that gravity is a force that pulls things down.
• Describe the incline of a pathway using words such as steep, gentle, steeper, less steep.
• Describe the surface texture of a pathway or an object using words such as smooth, slippery, bumpy. 
• Begin to understand that friction slows objects down, and that the rougher the object, the more friction it creates when it rubs against another object.
• Understand that objects generally move farther and faster on steeper or smoother pathways.
• Carry out experiments about how an object will move on different pathways and about how objects with different surface textures will move on identical pathways.
• Begin to make predictions, to record data, to compare observations to predictions, and to construct explanations of the observations.

The Ramps Journal and the entire Ramps curriculum supplement from Early Science with Nico & Nor™ was rigorously researched and developed specifically for preschool classroom use. The Ramps unit contains two apps: Coconut Star and the Ramps Journal. Children and teachers use the Ramps Journal to record videos and results from their ramp experiments.

Each Early Science with Nico & Nor curriculum supplement combines traditional classroom activities with digital learning to promote young children’s engagement with age-appropriate science practices and concepts during circle time, learning centers, read-aloud book sessions, snack time, and outdoor play!

Three Good Things, a happiness journal, enables you to do exactly that with a simple user-interface and gamification to encourage engagement.
 
In the world today, society tends to focus on the negative. Rather than remembering all of the good things in their lives, people often focus on the things which they don’t like. With Three Good Things, you can rewire your brain to focus on the positive by writing down good things that happen to you everyday. By finding positive things that happen in your daily life, you train your mind to notice the good things in life instead of allowing it to focus on the negative.
 
As Harvard Professor Shawn Achor explains in his book The Happiness Advantage, ""this exercise has staying power.... the items you write down each day don't need to be profound or complicated, only specific. You can mention the delicious take-out Thai food you had for dinner, your child's bear hug at the end of a long day, or the well-deserved acknowledgement from your boss at work.""

"1509030899";"Recorda: Journal and Reminders";"Remember everything you have done so far or what you have to do in the future. Recorda reinvents and merges your personal diary, your to-do list, your notes and reminders in a single app. It allows you to quickly, easily and intuitively write down what comes to your mind. From your day to day to what you have to do in a week, a month or a year. Use it as it suits you, maybe even as your shopping list.

Some of the things you can do with the Recorda app are:

• Create multiple lists, in case you want to organize what you write down in different topics (your personal life, business or shopping list, among others).
• Create unlimited memories of past, future or undated dates. Either something you have done or anything you have to do. It may even be something you don't know when to do.
• Attach images, voice memos and tags to your memories to see them again at any time.
• Mark your memories as favorites to highlight those events that have impacted you the most or to not forget something very important that you have to do in the future.
• Set your memories as pending and completed to know if it is something you have already done or something you have yet to do that you don’t want to forget.
• Duplicate what you have noted to facilitate the entry of those events that are repetitive.
• Visualize in a clear and intuitive way in timeline format with our own taste everything you have written down over time.

And this is just the beginning, as we're working on a ton of other mind-blowing features.

Do you remember what you did on the last month’s Saturday or what you have to do next Friday? With Recorda you will never forget again.

"1486406975";"Minimalistic Daily Diary";"Writing is one of the most effective ways to become happier, more productive, and clearer in your thinking. It could be with a pen and paper, but it could also be with Minimalistic Daily Diary. By setting words to your feelings and thoughts helps you make sense of the world and your life. And by simply writing about your day you would be much more likely to achieve what you have set out to achieve. 

Benjamin Franklin once said, “Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.” Which I believe is a great saying and gives us a great insight into why writing is so powerful.

With Minimalistic Daily Diary you are given a great and intuitive tool for writing about your day. The app is designed to help you focus on the text itself and therefore the app does not have any unnecessary features.

If you are not the writing type you could instead dictate your thoughts in an industry-leading speech-to-text recognition by Apple. You can choose between multiple languages so you can dictate in your language.

To remember your day and life even more vividly you can add images to your notes. They say an image says more than a thousand words I truly understand this saying. That is why I have enabled this function for you to use.

Minimalistic Daily Dairy is more than just a note-taking app and just as it has helped and empowered my life to use it and write down my thoughts, I truly believe it can and will help you! So, take a moment and install Minimalistic Daily Dairy and write about your day.

"441375533";"Any Day Journal";"Any Day Journal has reached the end of its development life. You may see occasional bug fixes, but if you're looking to start a journal, please look elsewhere.


""Any day is a good day to start a journal; to promise, again, to tell the truth — the whole, nothing but, etc, etc. The gaps don't matter — it’s the writing down that counts.""

The line is from one of Logan Mountstuart’s journals, in William Boyd's ""Any Human Heart"".

Maybe you’ve been meaning to keep a journal, or you wish that you had kept a journal. Today is a good day to start your journal, and Any Day Journal is a good way to start it.

Any Day runs on your iPhone. Why your iPhone? Because you’ll have it handy when you want to make a journal entry. Any Day has a clean, no-frills, intuitive interface, and leverages the iPhone’s built-in capabilities to keep track of the time and location of your journal entries, to incorporate photos, movie clips, sketches and sound clips, all without getting in your way. You can search and export your journal as well.

The key to journaling isn't features, though, it's you, writing. Any Day and your iPhone make it easy to keep that journal. All you need to do is start.

Any Day makes an ideal travel journal, birding journal (with photos and locations), project journal, whatever. It’s there when you want it.

Let’s give Logan Mountstuart the last word:

""David Gascoyne once told me that the only point of keeping a journal was to concentrate on the personal, the diurnal minutiae, and forget the great and significant events in the world at large. The newspapers cover all that, anyway, he said. We don’t want to know that 'Hitler invaded Poland'—we’re more curious about what you had for breakfast. Unless you happened to be there, of course, when Hitler invaded Poland and your breakfast was interrupted. It’s a point, I suppose, but I felt it would be worth picking up this journal again today if only because I’ve just walked out into my African garden and looked up at the moon. Looked up at the moon to marvel at the fact that there are two young American men walking around on its surface. Even Gascoyne would grant me that."""

"1488294293";"Rachel's Diary - Match 3";"Dear diary,
my life is a complete mess.
I'm 32, with a dead-end job, and haven't dated anyone in over a year.
Sometimes I wish someone else would make my choices for me.

Meet Rachel, a 30-something career woman without much of a career, and without much luck in romance.
But that's all going to change... Thanks to YOU!

Solve fun and exciting match 3 puzzles to continue through Rachel's story and help her make life choices at every turn. Should she go on a date with her boss? What should she talk to him about? What can she do to make him fall for her unconditionally? All of these choices are in your hands!
You write Rachel's story!

Let me tell you a bit about the game

Basically, you get to solve my problems
Which is great, because honestly I haven't been doing so well with that lately. You make my choices for me, decide my story, and I'll write it all down in my diary and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Just *try* not to make things even worse?

Also, it's got those match 3 puzzle games people like
I don't know what it is about matching games, but I hear people get super into them, so knock yourself out I guess? Apparently you tap some matching blocks and blast them and it's supposed to be really fun?

More importantly, you get to follow my romance story
I mean, yeah, at the moment there isn't really any romance. YET. I'm counting on you to make the right choices, okay? And then there's gonna be romance, like, everywhere. A new hunky guy every episode, you know? That's what we're going for. Every episode!

 It's all free
I don't know how they do it, but you can play all the match 3 romance puzzle games you can stomach without paying anything at all. Giving away games for free? Poor guys must be starving.

Sneak a peek at Rachel's diary, read her romance story, and solve fun match 3 matching puzzle games in the process! Help Rachel make better life choices and enjoy the resulting drama. And, most importantly: save me from spending another Christmas alone!"

Start writing dream journals every day. Start finding dream meanings and get lucidity. and It can be the start of shifting realities. Use ai art to visualize your dreams. Track your dream moods.

Groovy Notes leverages the ease of use of a diary by employing the capabilities of your iPad such as the ability to record voice notes and touch gestures to navigate between views.

It is realistic!

Be it notes, memos, anniversaries, lists, to-dos or even your personal journal - everything can be easily managed with Groovy Notes. All the notes are well organized by categories, tags and date.

Our prayer for the LifeJournal (Gospel focused) community is that God would use this tool to bring direction and order to what is very often a chaotic and scattered day. 

We are unapologetic in our belief that goal setting and productivity are not separate from or at odds with spiritual disciplines. Instead, they work hand-in-hand, and the LifeJournal app is a catalyst to facilitate that.

Our faith and our good works should live in the same space.

LifeJournal is built to be a place to go to for your quiet time, bible study, thankfulness, sermon notes, prayer, journaling and use throughout your day for simple to-do lists, and tracking your daily routines. 

The thankfulness area is just a quick place to start each day recognizing how God has blessed you or what you are grateful for that day. - Colossians 3:15

Journaling is something we all know we should do, and often just don’t find the time to include it in our quiet time or morning routine. LifeJournal makes journaling simple and provides resources to help you find easy ways to effectively journal.

The daily routines are broken into morning, daily, and evening - giving you a chance to organize your day into sections and see progress through out each and every day. 

With LifeJournal you are also able to use the audio to text dictation feature and journal or create prayer journals by speaking into the app - this can even be done (safely) while driving down the road when there just isn’t time in the morning to sit down and journal your thoughts.

The prayer section gives you the option for a long form prayer (prayer journal) or a quick prayer list to go through each day. 1 Thessalonians 5:17

The sermon notes section gives you a specific place to keep notes on sermons or podcasts so you can go back and reflect on them later. Taking notes while listening has been shown to increase retention of new themes, lessons or concepts taught. 

The LifeJournal Bible Study section allows you to select a chapter and verse to study, and then take notes while quickly flipping back and forth between LifeJournal and one of the most popular Bible apps. 


Our Free 7-Day Trial Gives You Full Access to LifeJournal: 

• Create a habit of thankfulness
• Keep a consistent journal
• Write out a prayer journal and track prayer lists
• Take sermon notes
• Simplify your to-do lists


What do people use LifeJournal for?

The Shadow Self is the side to us that we tend to repress and hide from others. It’s the side made up of the nasty tendencies, weaknesses, childhood wounds & desires that have been conditioned to be hidden throughout our upbringing. 

“Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is. At all counts, it forms an unconscious snag, thwarting our most well-meant intentions.” - Carl Jung

“Shadow-work enables us to alter our self-sabotaging behaviour so that we can achieve a more self-directed life” - Connie Zweig

Whether you are in your backyard, a meadow, a park or arboretum, the Wildflower Journal makes recording your sightings easy, fun and fast! You can e-mail, message or airdrop your sightings with friends, other naturals or experts!

You spotted a wildflower? Click “add sighting” and the App. immediately records the time, date and the exact location using GPS coordinates (including city, state and nation). Your flower will be displayed with a photo icon on a map and in a sighting table, sortable by date or common name. Start entering the name of the flower in the “search” bar and the app will pull up a list of wildflowers.

Not sure what plant you’ve seen, but know that it’s some kind of aster? Use the “family spinner” to select aster and you will be offered a list of possibilities, along with helpful photos.  

With the Wildflower Journal you can take and attach your own photos to your sighting; add comments; and tap the “count” button and scroll to quickly enter the number you have sighted.

The App works great in remote areas without internet and/or mobile connections.

There are links to the Wikipedia web sites for more information about your flower.

Chose the wrong flower? No problem, you can easily change or delete it.  Even leave place holders for unidentified plants for later identification.

You can manually enter unusual North American wildflower.   The app currently lists 1,384 plants and can be searched by color, name or family.

Export your sighting (or a subset) to another device with Wildflower Journal installed.  Ideal if you use an iPhone in the field and an iPad at home or if you're sharing lists among family and/or friends.

Wildflower is highly customizable. Set the app to display your sightings by date, location or flower. Choose to view all of your flowers, those spotted on specific dates, by specific location or display your unique birds only.

Your sightings can be shared through text, email, social media like Facebook.

Wildflower is a 21st century replacement for your dog-eared sighting journal."

The information derived from monitoring a plants life cycle has helped increase yield and potency over time. Up until now most growers have used a variety of tools to track this information, excel sheets, word documents, photo galleries, and good old pen and paper. Bud aims to put this all in one place and give growers an organized way to track grows.

Growing is often a solitary activity and for those who want to keep it this way bud allows users to keep all their journals private. But for those who like to share, get feedback, discuss strains, talk techniques, and ask advice, bud offers a way for users to easily share their journals with the community. Public journals can be seen by all, and users can follow individual grows or other users to keep up to date with their latest updates. Privacy is important to growers so all images are stripped of meta data before being stored and shared.

You can add entries to the diary, like a mindfulness session or an area to list reasons for gratitude. You may even configure the diary as a travel journal or a dreams journal! That's easy to setup too: the only limit is your imagination.


-- “I can shake off everything as I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.” -- Anne Frank


Your diary should be as private as you want. We do not upload your data anywhere, we don't track you and we value your privacy. And you get even more: we included a system to lock the app, so that no intruder can see your diary without your consent. Your diary is yours, private and secure.


-- “Whether you’re keeping a journal or writing as a meditation, it’s the same thing. What’s important is you’re having a relationship with your mind.” -- Natalie Goldberg


You are using an advanced device, so we're providing advanced and easy to use features. Like a cute mood tracking system. Or a way to import pictures in your journal. But also a calendar to navigate your memories... You can feel at ease, with a simple and familiar diary in your hands but also feel the power of the new tech you are using. We hope you will enjoy the balance.


-- “I don’t journal to ‘be productive.’ I don’t do it to find great ideas or to put down prose I can later publish. The pages aren’t intended for anyone but me. It’s the most cost-effective therapy I’ve ever found.” -- Tim Ferriss


Download and try it, you will not regret it!

Social media is too public and scrapbooking is too hard - share your memories with your partner in one place, just for the two of you. Each memory has a place for you to upload photos and each add a note about your special moment. 

Twig makes it easy to document even the smallest of sweet moments. Plus, it's completely free.

Both my fiancé Kassidy and I have gifted each other various forms of scrapbooks. While that definitely has its place, we wanted something that could be used any time something special happened. So I set out to make this app. Now we've got a rolling memory of all sorts of special moments we've shared!

"1372575227";"Gratitude Journal, Affirmation";"The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.

With a gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.

You can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations.

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. CREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. DAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

5. MINDFUL MINUTES

We define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.

"1570951174";"Justly: Habits, Goals, Journal";"Inspired by the science behind how the human mind works, this app focuses on creating systems and processes to build your dream life.

Ever wondered why you are not doing well enough?
Writing goals again and again but not achieving any?
Always waiting for the right moment?

Well, that's not the right way to look at life. ""Walk slowly, but never backward"" - they say.

Think of goals and dreams as results. Those are good but they never come real fast and that's very disappointing.

Instead, take goals, figure out what you need to do to achieve them and then forget the goals. Design a system and processes that will allow doing what's needed.

Slowly but surely, you will start seeing results, mostly more than expected. Your right processes will start giving you fruits and you will fall ahead of your goals.

Give Justly a try and as James Clear put it in the book Atomic Habits, you will see remarkable results with tiny changes.

PS - If you are looking for results within a week, this app is not for you.
PS2 - This is not just a habit tracker app.

""For over 10 years, I’ve been recording 1 second every day, so I’ll never forget another day ever again. This project had such a positive impact on my day-to-day life after a few months, that I dedicated my life to making a mobile app which would make it easy for anyone to do this too. Being able to relive every single day has provided me with a treasured perspective on life. It holds me accountable for making each day notable. When I turned 40, I had a 1-hour movie that encapsulated my 30s. If I live to see 80 years of age, I’ll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.""

"1475128511";"Bloom: CBT Therapy & Journal";"Bloom is the easiest & most affordable way to learn the ropes of therapy. Train your mind with personalized daily mental health education. We've made videos that help teach skills to manage stress and anxiety, improve sleep, build better habits, foster stronger relationships and improve one's quality of life.

We work with experts who are fluent in cognitive-behavioral-therapy (CBT). (More about why we chose CBT below). Bloom combines interactive video classes with journaling and mindfulness exercises to help you work on your mental well-being, change your mood & cultivate more joy in life.

HOW DOES BLOOM WORK?
Bloom is your personalized journey to a healthy state of mind. Bloom combines digital programs, guided journaling, and emotional analysis to give you a new hyper-personalized digital therapy experience. Through guided video classes, you will learn new self-care practices to cultivate more joy, happiness, and positivity in your life. Improve your personal well-being, manage stress & anxiety and feed your emotional health.
 
WHERE IS THE CONTENT COMING FROM?
All our classes are science-backed and bring you the latest research in mental health. Every video is designed & developed by a leading clinical therapist and best-selling author on CBT, Seth Gillihan, PhD. 
 
IS BLOOM SECURE?
Your safety & security are our #1 priorities. All journaling entries are encrypted and saved in the cloud. Nothing is seen by humans. None of your training data is shared with third-parties or outside partners. 
 
IS BLOOM EFFECTIVE?
The team at Bloom understand how helpful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be for folks who need to improve their mental well being. We focus on teaching about CBT because outside research shows, again and again, that it the most effective form of therapy to improve mental well-being for the vast majority of folks who experience symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Studies show that patients can get the benefits of learning CBT techniques without an in-person therapist. Bloom gives users the power to learn about mental health in a guided & self-directed way at their own pace. 
 
WHAT USERS SAY
Bloom is considered a cheaper and more accessible option:
“Not everybody has access or can afford a therapist. This is like a therapist in my pocket. Personalized but still private.”
“I love that I can do it at my own time and I don’t have to feel awkward talking to a stranger about my life.”
“It’s an easy and private discrete thing, no one even has to know!”

DO NOT USE BLOOM IF....
CBT and digital options like Bloom aren't a fit for everybody. If you're suffering from severe depression or anxiety, Bloom education alone may not be the right choice for you. Bloom cannot and does not diagnose, only a medical provider can do that. If you are in need of a treatment plan, please seek care under the supervision of a medical professional. We are not a clinic, nor are we a medical device. We hope that you get the treatment you need. 

WHEN SHOULD I USE CBT?
CBT can help people with depression by giving you tools to challenge the negative thoughts and override them with more realistic and positive thought processes. CBT is also used to help many more psychological problems. In some cases, other forms of therapy used at the same time may be recommended for best results.

DOES IT WORK FOR TRAUMA?
If you have been diagnosed with PTSD, your provider may have suggested CBT. But if you were diagnosed with cPTSD (complex PTSD), your medical professional may prefer you to use a DBT program. At this time, Bloom does not offer DBT.

"1532196092";"Gratitude Diary. Mindfullness";"Gratitude Diary is a new app that helps you practicing gratitude in your life.

Gratitude is defined by Psychology Today as “an emotion expressing appreciation for what one has.” According to Robert Emmons, one of the leading gratitude experts, this appreciation consists of two primary elements.
One, it reinforces the idea that there is goodness in our lives and in our world – even when things aren’t perfect.

Two, it requires us to see that this goodness often derives from sources beyond ourselves. In other words, by expressing gratitude, we realize we benefit from our interconnectedness with other people, places, and things.
We believe that this interconnection between our internal world and the external world is a key to psychological well-being.

Science confirms that daily practice of gratitude reduces stress, improves positive life attitude and relationship and counteracts depression.
Try our app and rewire your brain step by step towards more positive and healthy attitude.

• Documents the growth of multiple plants over an endless number of days
• Shows daily plant growth through photos and measurements
• Provides photo albums and graphs to review how the plants changed over time
• Aligns with research-based early science learning trajectories
• No in-app purchases
• No advertising

This app is designed to help children strengthen their science investigation skills and explore the concepts of growth and change as they:
• Identify some of the things a plant needs to grow: water, light, and time.
• Observe and describe characteristics of seeds and plants.
• Identify and describe parts of a sprouting seed and growing plant.
• Record observations and data about growing plants.
• Begin to pose questions and make predictions about how a seed or plant may change over time.

The Plants Journal and the entire Plants curriculum supplement from Early Science with Nico & Nor™ was rigorously researched and developed specifically for preschool classroom use. The Plants unit contains two apps: Wonder Farm and the Plants Journal. In Wonder Farm, children plant digital seeds and help them grow.

Each Early Science with Nico & Nor curriculum supplement combines traditional classroom activities with digital learning to promote young children’s engagement with age-appropriate science practices and concepts during circle time, learning centers, read-aloud book sessions, snack time, and outdoor play!

"1478718334";"AutoDiary+";"When did that take place?
This question comes in our minds often.

“AutoDiary+” is an app that can be used to keep track of your movements.
It records where you have been and when, and sorts the information by location.
Important details can be added in the form of pictures, short notes, and voice memos.
For each location, you will have a record of whom you were with, along with their names and photos.
In addition, the pictures you took are automatically sorted.
For example, the app searches for the places you visited at night (and their pictures) that are within 2.5 kilometers of Disneyland.
In an instant, you will find the spots you have visited – but forgotten – displayed in front of you.

There is also a function that analyzes your movements and shows the results for each day, month, and year.
How many hours did you spend at office, and what percentage of your life does that time occupy?
You will be able to monitor such details through graphs.

Moreover, the app measures mobile data usage and battery percentage.
It gives off alarm sounds to alert you if you go over the limits you have set for yourself.
By linking with the iPhone's healthcare function, it is now possible to display the number of steps.
The status of movement is listed separately from trains and cars.

All data are only kept in your iPhone (or iPad), so there will be no leakage of personal information.
The GPS is only used when you are out and about.
When you are staying at one place for a while, the GPS will automatically turn off.
The app is designed to be power efficient, consuming only about 4 percent of battery life per hour on iPhone X even when you are traveling.
Since most of us do not travel more than 4 to 5 hours each day, you should not have to worry about battery going off.
On top of that, the app automatically fixes issues with location data and obtains accurate location information, by utilizing the unique location correction technology that has been acquired through the development of GPS devices.

So, let's get started by installing the app.
It will for sure be the tool you cannot live without.

(Attention) Your movements may not be tracked right away if the Wi-Fi is turned off.
The same happens if you continue to connect to a mobile router.


All functions on the app are available for free for 4 weeks.
Once the subscription for the app expires, the location measurement function will stop running.
Please check the measurement end date in the Settings screen for ""Travel Log.""

To continue measuring locations, please purchase one of the function options below:
Automatic measurement - 1 month extension
Automatic measurement - 6 months extension
Automatic measurement - 1 year extension
You can make a purchase by clicking on the ""Measurement Extension"" button in the Settings screen for ""Travel Log.""
If a purchase is made during the free-use period, the remainder of the free-use period will be applied after the extension period is over.

When switching to a new phone, please click on the ""Purchase Restore"" button in the Settings screen for ""Travel Log.""
The app can be restored for free if you log in using the same Apple ID as when you first purchased the function option.

After the purchase is made, the function option that you have previously bought will be automatically renewed.
If you do not cancel the automatic renewal at least 24 hours prior to the end of the contract period, the contract period will be automatically renewed. 
Automatic renewal billing will take place within 24 hours after the contract period is over.

After the purchase is made, the ""Automatic Renewal Cancellation"" button will appear in the Settings screen for ""Travel Log.""
The contract can be cancelled from there.
If you have deleted the app, please cancel it from the ""Settings"" screen of your iPhone.

"6444026526";"Food Diary Bee";"Finally, a food diary app that's simple and easy to use without the extra baggage.  

You now have a photo food journaling app to help you achieve your diet and body goals.

If you look at most food journaling apps, they require you to enter so much information that by time you’re finished, your food has become cold.

That's just crazy! You only need a few taps to log a meal. With Food Diary Bee app, you’ll just “get it” immediately.  This food diary app makes tracking your daily meals super easy and effortless.

With FoodDiaryBee you’ll be able to:

Use your food diary to optimize meals in order to reach your health and fitness goals quicker
Just snap your meals and you're done. No more tedious calorie counting and barcode scanning. 
Generate a PDF report of past meals and share with friends or a nutritionist
Set your own custom daily meal reminders to help you log meals consistently
Free yourself from endless fad diets and grueling calorie counting 


WHY FOOD TRACKING WORKS

When you track your food, you are more aware of what you are eating and how much you are eating. 

You make better choices about the food you eat. You may be less likely to overeat or make unhealthy choices if you are aware of what you are eating. 

Tracking your food can also help you see how your diet affects your health. If you are tracking your food and you notice that you are not feeling well after eating certain foods, you can make changes to your diet. 


The Food Diary Bee app is designed to help you make healthy food choices. By keeping track of all the meals you have in a day, you can see at a glance what kind of choices you're making. 

Photographing your meals encourages you to be more mindful of what you're eating and may help you change your eating habits. Meal reminders help you with regular eating, and you'll feel more energetic throughout the day.
FOOD JOURNAL + MEAL REMINDERS: VERY POWERFUL WHEN COMBINED

By using meal reminders, you’re literally building a habit to eat at certain times during the day. 

Eating on time has many benefits that often go overlooked. 

It can improve your

Mood: When you’re hungry, your blood sugar drops and this can lead to irritability and crankiness. Eating on time can help keep your blood sugar levels stable and therefore help improve your mood. 

Weight: If you’re trying to lose weight, eating on time can help you. When you let yourself get too hungry, you’re more likely to make poor food choices or eat too much. But if you eat regular meals and snacks throughout the day, you’re less likely to overeat. 

Energy: Eating on time can also give you more energy. When you skip meals, your blood sugar drops and this can make you feel tired. But when you eat, your blood sugar levels rise and this gives you a boost of energy. So if you’re feeling tired, instead of reaching for a cup of coffee, try eating a healthy snack. 


A Food Diary Bee app is a very helpful tool when trying to improve your overall health. It can help you to be more mindful of what you are eating and make better choices taking closer to your health goals everyday.

"387173290";"Thought Diary Pro";"The way we think determines both how we feel and how we behave. The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behaviour. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. 

A thought diary is designed to help people record and change the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. The Thought Diary Pro is the advanced version of the Thought Diary, and allows the  identification of thinking errors (also known as 'cognitive distortions'), and the the modification of our unhelpful thoughts into more productive ways of thinking. By challenging the thoughts and beliefs that cause discontentment, dissatisfaction and other emotional and behavioural distress, we can improve our mental health and can change the destructive or adverse behaviours we may engage in as a result of our negative thoughts. 

Thought Diary Pro is designed to be the second step in changing our thinking patterns by helping individuals identify the thinking errors that they engage in, and thereby helping change these thoughts. The effect of modifying these thought can reduce the negative emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. Similar to the Thought Diary, the Pro version was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT."

"1293753685";"Jäger - jagt journal til jæger";"Jäger er jagt appen, for enhver jæger.

Appen indeholder alle de vigtigste jagt værktøjer som anvendes af jægere.
Jægerne får alle features helt gratis, så værsgo' og god jagt.

NYHED:
Integration af vildtkameraer fra Østjysk Våbenhandel. Burrel eller Huntcom
Det er nu muligt at tilknytte vildtkameraer i appen. Billederne kan ses i journalen under observationer. Herfra kan de let downloades til telefonens fotoalbum.Men det smarteste her er at du kan tilknytte dit kamera til en gruppe du enten selv har oprettet eller er blevet inviteret til. Det betyder du nu kan være en del at et konsortie eller anden jagtgruppe, hvor i hver bringer et kamera, men ser billederne fra jer alle.

Ideelt til mårhundegrupper, konsortier eller bare mellem jagtkammerater.

Nu kan du oprette grupper og dele jeres jagtoplevelser på i fællesgrupper.
Der kan chattes og aftales nærmere omkring jagten.
Godt til jagtkonsortiet, kollegaerne eller bare dine bedste jagtkammerater.

Jagt journal
Smart jagt journal som er forbundet med Miljøstyrelsen for at håndtere vildtudbytteregistrering helt automatisk.
Jäger er markedets bedste jagtjournal. Som jæger, føres man igennem et intelligent flow, som er tilpasset arten der er nedlagt som sine jagt udbytter. Geotagging hjælper med at identificere kommunes navn, ligesom tid og sted for din jagt registreres automatisk. 
Mere præcis registrering af vildtudbytte er medvirkende til at skabe rammerne for bæredygtige bestande. Som jægere er vi naturforvaltere gennem jagt. Jagt er en jægers bidrag til naturforvaltning.
Al jagt udbyttet kan ses i appen med høj detaljeringsgrad og billeder.

Afstandsmåler
På jagt er det vigtigt at være orienteret om afstandene fra sin post. En jæger er ansvarlig for at jagt udføres forsvarligt, dette indbefatter også om det er forsvarligt skud til sommerbukken. 
Jäger appens afstandsmåler er jagt værktøjet, som giver dette overblik. Når en jæger eksempelvis har afgivet skud til en hjort, kan jægeren måle afstanden, fra skydetårnet til træfstedet. Afstandsmåleren husker det målte og tilføjer det derefter i jægerens personlige jagt journal.

Schweisshunderegister
Desværre er det uundgåeligt, når man går på jagt, at en jæger anskyder et dyr, som derfor skal findes og aflives.
Derfor har vi udviklet en funktion, så du kan tilkalde den nærmeste schweisshund.
Jæger registrerer to GPS-punkter i appen. Placeringen for anskydningen og en placering for, hvor hundefører og jæger mødes. Oplysningerne sendes enkelt i SMS direkte til den nærmeste hundefører, som jagt appen henviser jægeren til ud fra afstand fra lokation til hundeførerens adresse. Eftersøgningerne har dermed et bedre udgangspunkt for at lykkedes.

Offline funktionalitet
For at kunne registrere dit jagt udbytte mest nøjagtigt, vha. GPS, er det vigtigt at jagt appen fungerer, uanset om jæger befinder sig uden for mobildækning, som jagt sagtens kan gøre.
Jäger fungerer offline på de vigtigste funktionaliteter. 
Når jæger igen er indenfor mobildækning, hentes satellitkort, jagt vejr m.m., og der uploades til jagt journalen automatisk.

Andre jagt værktøjer
- Generelle jagttider (kommer snart med GPS funktion)
- Lokale jagttider (kommer snart med GPS funktion)

- Solopgang og solnedgang samt månefaser (Almanak)
- Vejrtjeneste med grader, vindretning og vindstyrke, luftfugtighed
- Jagt vejret er både på detaljeniveau for dagen samt oversigt over ugen

Nyheder
Vi distribuerer nyheder til dig som jæger. Det er nyheder fra forskellige organisationer og myndigheder, som i mange tilfælde kan være jagt relateret, eller tæt på, så det er relevant for en jæger.

En samlet jagt platform
Vi vil i kommende tid også lancere andre features. Det vil være naturligt at samle vores virksomheds jagt aktiviteter i ét stort jagt miljø.
Det vil være jagtformidling, hvor vi driver den største platform for jagtformidling i Danmark under danskjagtformidling.dk og det samme for jagtauktioner.dk. 
Vi har en jagt portal i beta nu, som findes på jaeger-app.dk.

God jagt

"6447526716";"Blood Pressure App Diary, BPD";"Fed up with installing a thousand different apps to monitor your father's blood pressure only to find lies?

Lies in the form of apps that promise you'll be able to measure your mother's blood pressure just by placing her fingerprint on the screen, right?

Well, let me tell you something... Even if it hurts my own cause, a mobile device like the one you're holding right now, which you're using to read this, can't perform that function.

It's impossible.

Period.

But keep reading; you might be interested.

Look...

I live with someone who has high blood pressure, diabetes, and is overweight.

Every day, even if I don't do it myself, my mother has to check my grandmother's blood pressure. Test her blood sugar several times a day. Weigh her every few days.

It's a big hassle.

But a big one...

Even if she does it out of love, because in the end it's her mother, I know it's tough on her.

I mean, I completely understand how you're feeling.

And because I know, I made this app...

For you, someone with a father or mother with one of these life-limiting and frustrating illnesses due to the dependency they create.

To make your day-to-day life much easier, more comfortable, and less worrisome to manage. And to make the day-to-day life of the person who brought you into the world safer and more controlled.

Anyway, you can choose to install the app or not. That doesn't matter much to me.

But if you don't, you'll lose control and gain worries.

And now, let's see what you can do with it.

Generally speaking... Someone with a condition like hypertension or high blood sugar usually has more associated health problems.

Because of this, I decided to remove some functionality that I didn't see as necessary...

...and replace it with:

    A system to have a strong heart by regularly monitoring your heart rate.
    A journal to avoid surprises from fluctuating blood sugar levels.
    Another journal to keep the nurse from scolding you when you take your parents for a check-up, monitoring their weight.
    And a product scanner to find nutritional information for whatever you need.

And now, explore what you can do with our free blood pressure app.

Need to control low blood pressure? You can do it.

Or maybe you need to check blood pressure with a fingerprint for free, right? If so, we're here for you.

Speaking of free, did you know you can also monitor blood pressure with your finger for free? Not with us, but you can do it.

And since I already know you've decided without needing to read this far, downloading a fingerprint blood pressure monitor may be the best decision you make today.

It doesn't matter if it's this app or another; that's not important to me. What's important is your father's health.

If you suffer from high blood pressure, low blood pressure, or any of the heart-related ""pressures,"" this might be what you're looking for.

One more thing, although I think it's been more or less clear, measuring blood pressure with a finger on a mobile device is NOT POSSIBLE, unless you have a blood pressure monitor that can physically connect to the device.

So all those apps that are marketed as finger blood pressure monitors are not true. I repeat, you cannot measure blood pressure with a finger for free.

With our app, what you will be able to do is take blood pressure readings for free in Spanish and many other languages. Keep a diary of your readings, review past entries, and send your measurements to your doctor with just one button.

In short, our digital blood pressure monitor will allow you to better manage the heart health of whoever you need. No more, no less.

Finally, the app is implementing a biometric fingerprint blocker. So in future versions, you will be able to unlock the app with your finger.

One way to improve your mood or anxiety is to look at your thoughts and test whether they are realistic by looking at evidence for and against them. If you are interested in doing this, this app can help.

This app helps you track situations that make you feel sad or anxious, or other negative emotions. You can then test whether your thoughts are realistic by looking at evidence for and against them, and come up with different ways of viewing the

"385433207";"Thought Diary";"The way we think determines both how we feel and how we behave. The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behaviour. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. 

A thought diary is designed to help people record the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. By recording our unhelpful thoughts, we can learn to identify thinking errors (also known as ‘negative’, ‘automatic’ or ‘dysfunctional’ thoughts). It is a common tool used in CBT to assist individuals in identifying unhelpful thinking patterns, which will then provide the opportunity to challenge and change these thoughts and thereby reducing psychological distress.  

This Thought Diary is designed to be the first step in changing our thoughts by helping individuals identify the trigger situations for their negative thoughts and the emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. It was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT.

When the Thought Diary is emailed it takes the traditional format of a CBT thought record.

How to Use:
The Thought Diary should be used when you experience a negative emotional state or engage in unhelpful or self destructive behaviour (Consequences). 

Step one: record what you were doing and where you were at that time (date, time and situation). This can help identify whether there is a particular pattern present in the emotional distress or behaviour problem. 

Step two:  note down what you were thinking at the time (thought), and how much you believed this thought (belief rating). The belief rating is useful to determine the degree to which we believe the thoughts, and can indicate whether the conviction in these thoughts changes when we challenge these thoughts in the next step of CBT. 

Step three: record how you felt and what you did in response (consequences). It can sometimes be easier to write down the consequences as the first step as they are primary indicators of distress, and then work through the other categories. There are usually both emotional and behavioural consequences, and sometime another thinking pattern is activated which is why we have provided a category for ‘thoughts’. 

However, it may not be necessary to complete all these categories in the consequences step if only emotional and/or behavioural disturbance is obvious."

"1562084190";"Complete daily Journal: Sernal";"Sernal is a complete CBT thought dairy with daily motivation quotes, a goal board, habits, sleep & medication tracker. You could also take unlimited notes & draw your feeling in the app.

A very wise saying is, “We do not learn from experience… we learn from reflecting on experience”, so how to reflect on our experience & make the most of it, there are two ways, you remember everything and act accordingly or you could write it somewhere permanent and refer it.

If you are very good at remembering every detail of your life, you really don’t need this app, per se. any journaling app, but come on, we even forget our best buddy’s birthdays & our anniversaries, so we need something to put our thoughts on, just at least a paper.

If you choose paper, it is still a good idea, but once you accumulated months of journaling, it becomes messy and takes ages to search for what happened on a very particular day & how you reacted and overcame that situation.  Moreover, do you like to carry a paper notebook everywhere to refer to & write a daily journal, probably NO?

That’s why you need Sernal, a complete journaling experience, where you can keep track of almost anything, from once-in-a-lifetime events to everyday moments and all your journals are kept in secure storage accessible only to you. 

Sernal is like your best buddy to vent out your feeling and keep track of your mood throughout the day.

Features of the app include…

TRACK MOOD.
Of course, this is the main feature, here you could mark how you are feeling at any time of the day (or for the whole day), with deeper insights. 
 
 
TRACK HABITS.
Create a list of good & bad habits and track them daily, to know how much they affected you either positively or negatively. 

TRACK MEDICATION & SLEEP.
If you are taking medicines daily, this feature will help you note down which are the medicines you took in daily quantity and their effects.

TAKE NOTES.
Sernal also works as a note-taking app, where you could write down your creative ideas, add your personal goals, make your shopping list, etc.

In addition to the above, to further improve your journaling experience, Sernal allows you:
• Add your goal to the main screen,
• Explore exciting statistics about your life on weekly, and monthly charts to measure their impact on your day.
• To import your calendar entries & log them in a daily journal.
• Set daily journal writing reminders at the time of your preference, to make it a habit.
• To add your goals & daily motivation as home widgets. 
• Option to draw your mood, If you felt you are not in a mood to write.
• Quirky messages at the end of journal writing.

And the one option we like most is the facility to mark the day as important. You come to know how useful this feature is, once you started writing a journal.

 
OUR-PROMISE 
We are never going to share your login details, personal details, journal details, or any of your data with anyone, irrespective of your subscription status.

PRO Subscription
Sernal offers an auto-renewing annual subscription to become a PRO member, which offers.

Simplicity is at the core of Memoiri's design. The app features a single screen where you can write your entries in a linear fashion, without any distractions. Every entry is automatically grouped by day and time, making it easy to navigate through your memories and revisit past moments.

But Memoiri is more than just a simple diary app. It's a personal companion that helps you reflect on your life and track your mood over time. With its built-in mood tracker, you can easily rate your daily mood with the use of emojis, because an emoji says more than a thousand words, and see how it changes over days, weeks, or months.

And because Memoiri is designed with attention to detail, you can be sure that every aspect of the app feels intuitive and polished. Whether you're writing a new entry or browsing through your past memories, Memoiri makes the experience delightful and engaging.

With Memoiri, you can:

-Write down your daily thoughts and memories in a simple and hassle-free way
-Your entries are grouped by day and time to easily navigate through your memories
-Track your daily mood with emojis , and see how it evolves over time
-Enjoy a clean and minimalist design that puts your memories first

Download Memoiri today and start capturing your life's moments in a beautiful and meaningful way!"

CAPTURING MEMORIES MADE EASY

Do you think that it would be awesome to keep a diary, but it seems to take too much time and effort? 
Do you want to enjoy the health benefits of journaling? Do you like the idea of looking through memories when you are older?

One Minute Diary is here for everybody who does not get along too well with more traditional diaries. 
And for people who would like to try something new. It makes keeping a diary as easy, fast and enjoyable as possible.
It is developed by a psychologist from Germany who believes that keeping a diary should be fun and easy. 

So go ahead and give it a try. After all, it takes only one minute a day. 
One minute just for yourself.

FEATURES

- capture beautiful memories in 3 simple steps: choose a photo, write or speak for a minute or two and rate how you feel
- travel in time and explore and relive long-forgotten memories with smooth animations
- create memories daily or capture special moments whenever it feels right
- set a daily reminder to build a healthy journaling habit

- extra safety: export and import encrypted or unencrypted backups

THE STORY BEHIND THE APP

The app is created by me, Adrian, a psychologist (MSc) from Germany. I always wanted to keep a diary and I enjoy the idea of looking back at long-forgotten memories many years from now.

However, I discovered that traditional diaries and I are not a good match. I always struggled to take the time and to build a habit of keeping a diary. So I decided to build an app that solves that problem for me. After a while, I realized that I am not the only one with that problem. So I decided to share this app with the world. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do. If you do, please consider giving the app a 5-star rating and recommend it to your friends. That would help me out a lot.

If you have feedback, please participate in the 5 minute mini survey in the app's settings. Or you can send me an email (in the app settings: “send an email to the developer”). I would love to hear from you. The app will be updated regularly to value and incorporate your feedback.

Yours
Adrian"
"1661301401";"Diary: CBT Notes";"Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that helps individuals identify and change unhelpful or unhealthy thought patterns and behaviours. The goal of CBT is to positively influence a person’s emotions, behaviour and overall wellbeing. CBT can be used to treat a variety of issues, such as depression, anxiety, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. It helps people develop beneficial coping strategies and improve their problem-solving skills.

A CBT diary is a tool that is used to record events, thoughts, emotions, body reactions, behaviours, rational responses and cognitive distortions. It is used to track progress over time and help individuals learn more about their thought and behaviour patterns. The diary can also be used to set goals and develop strategies for improving mental health. By writing down their thoughts, emotions, and behaviours, individuals can gain greater insight into their own behaviour and gain new perspectives on the challenges they are facing.

# Design concept

The reality of the Ferris wheel is a place full of all kinds of emotions. Some people fall in love and embrace, some break up and cry, some are alone, some are in groups, there are laughter and there are tears. But no matter what mood, the Ferris wheel will use its mildest speed to respond one by one.

mooding is such a Ferris wheel that never closes, no matter positive or negative, it never stops, just like life, constantly carrying our joy, anger and sorrow.

To ride on this Ferris wheel, you need a ticket. You can combine rich elements to create a diary ticket that can match your mood at the moment.

From the moment you tear off the ticket stub and ride on the Ferris wheel, your diary will be sealed and appear on the Ferris wheel. Only through the diary to put our emotions at rest can we truly let go of the past and move forward bravely.

Did you know? At the highest point of the Ferris wheel, that is the closest place to maturity, mooding with you to witness growth.

Not even if you delete and and reinstall the app. In the Search Diary feature, enter your secret password to complete the two-factor authentication and enter the Secret Diary side of the app.
The app is used as a Standard Diary (red background) for people who know that no-one else would get access to it, but the Secret Diary (blue background) would be used by people who have other people who know the phones password. The second password prevents those people from viewing your secrets or stored information.
All data is stored in the Cloud so if you install it on multiple devices using the same Apple ID the data will be shared between all devices, but the Secret Diary feature will only be available to the person who initially set up the first device. 
There are no in-app purchases, advertisements etc. It is clean and simple to use and has no distractions. This is the first version of Lexters Secret Diary. Updates will be free in further updates.

"1572052087";"Daily Journal: CBT Self Care";"Getting to know your true, authentic self is a lifelong journey. Daily Journal is your guide to daily self-care. You can use to track your moods and jot down your feelings. And This is a App that allows you to process complex thoughts and emotions, which helps promote positive thinking and self-talk.

***WHY DO YOU NEED A DAILY JOURNAL?***

Having a consistent recording of your life can be invaluable because it allows you to track personal patterns or behaviors over time. This history can show your personal growth and give you memories of important moments in your life

***SURPRISING BENEFITS OF DAILY JOURNAL***

1. Can Reduce stress and anxiety.

Journaling about your anxieties soothes your nerves and helps you brainstorm for solutions to your problems.

You can also use the mood tracker found in Daily Journal to indicate your sentiment level. Overall, expressing yourself in a diary is a good way to free up any tension that prevents you from feeling happy.

2. Helps you learn from your experiences.

Daily Journal is a good way to help us to stop, take a step back and reflect on ourselves. We can look back at our life in a journal and think about how we've changed and what we can do to improve ourselves.

When you journal and reflect on the day, you’re more likely to draw lessons from what you’ve gone through.

3. Improves your communication skills.

When you journal, you learn to better express yourself. And this lets you better communicate your feelings with others.

The more self-aware you become, the more you can make yourself understood to others.

4. Improves your mindfulness.

Writing about your surroundings and the present moment helps you become more mindful every day – even when you’re not journaling. It teaches you to pay attention and be present. Daily Journal brings you into that state of mindfulness.

5. Boosts your self-esteem.

Positive journaling has been found to help improve feelings of well-being and self-esteem. A lack of confidence usually means an inner critic or a voice of self-doubt.

"1629419955";"Shape: Healthy Eating Journal";"You are worthy of treating yourself well, starting with what you eat.

With Shape, build awareness of what and why you eat through a lens of self-compassion. Steeped in this awareness, nourish and respect your body through the foods you choose daily. Healthy eating becomes a significant act of self-care.

But we know reshaping your life is more complex than just a simple choice. Grounded in behavior science, Shape is an app — like a coach you carry in your pocket — that teaches you ways to add more nutritious foods to your meals and helps you develop strategies to improve your eating habits. 

We guide you through making adjustments to your routines so that eating well becomes easy.

It’s not about restricting foods or counting calories to achieve a weight loss goal. Instead, explore your relationship around the food you eat so you can make informed decisions about your choices. You are constantly evolving; it’s time to open the door of possibilities with Shape.

Anchor Your Awareness
Grow your awareness about your eating patterns through simple keystone habits. Recognize how various foods make you feel with mindful eating exercises. Reconnect with the essential flavors of foods to appreciate each meal you eat. Learn ways to encourage yourself to eat more healthy, nutritious food.

Listen to Your Body
Understand your body’s cues of hunger and satiety so you can respect how much (and what!) your body needs to eat in order to feel your best. Move in ways that you love in order to support both your physical and mental well-being.

Nourish Yourself Wisely
Discover the core pillars of nutrition. Eat in ways that nurture who you truly are. Take a holistic approach to your health, starting with what you eat but also by finding ways to move every day, practicing self-compassion, improving your sleep habits, being mindful, and nurturing your connections with others.
Reach your goals — whether you want to lose weight, stay active as you age, manage emotional eating, or more — by making small, sustainable changes to your habits and routines.

Shape is from the creators of Fabulous, an award-winning app featured on Lifehacker, the New York Times, Self, Forbes, GirlBoss, and more. We’ve already helped millions of people worldwide achieve their goals through the power of habits and routines. We understand that change is made through small, repeated actions taken over time. Now we are helping people adjust how they approach their health. By using behavior science, it becomes impossible not to succeed!

Eating “perfectly” is impossible. Instead, learn to make conscious, proactive choices toward your health. We guide you on your journey toward nourishing yourself wisely with:
– Coaching series: Topics like managing stress eating, dealing with cravings, cultivating gratitude for your food, and more. Get a boost of support through difficult moments and inspiration to keep on track.
– Journeys: Step-by-step guides to establish food and health habits (and break unhelpful ones) that help you reach your goals.
– Food tracker and journal: Stay accountable for your choices and identify patterns. Explore your relationship with food and shed light on what’s supporting your well-being and what needs to change. Appreciate the variety and beauty of the foods you eat.

Go beyond healthy eating: replace judgment with curiosity and exchange comparison for compassion. You do not need to be a certain weight or have a certain body type to deserve self-kindness. You already have a body to treasure.

Eat well, but not to become worthy. Because you are already worthy, choose to eat well.

If you don't know when you want to complete a task just leave the date empty and it will go to your backlog from where you can assign it later.

Daily Me will always show you the next tasks to complete so you can organise your day easily.

THEMES represent the pillars of your day, and they can be in the form of a short sentence that motivates you or a quote that's meaningful to you and reminds you to be involved where it really matters. Set up to three themes and try to use them as a guide through the day.

JOURNALING is the act of exploring your thoughts and writing them down. You surely have things that are worth remembering, something that you are grateful for, that made you laugh or was a valuable lesson. It's easy to keep a journal with Daily Me.

"1092871281";"Passages Quote Journal";"Do you highlight your books? Are you a life-long learner? Passages stores your quotes and notes in a searchable app you can store in your pocket. Instead of leafing through piles of books and hundreds of pages, you can find your notes in seconds..

Reading should help you get ahead in your field and in life. Here's the thing: reading something once isn't the same as learning. You read piles of books, and you're still not applying the knowledge.

Are you a writer? Writers face a similar problem. You underline clever sentence structures and turns of phrase, but do you ever find them when you need them?

Have you ever re-read something and discovered a missed opportunity?

One day I needed to get my brakes fixed. When the mechanic gave me his high estimate, did I apply my negotiating skills? Did I flinch at their price? Did I ask for a better deal? No. Even though I had read a book about negotiations, I hadn't internalized the information.

Only after I had agreed to their several-hundred dollar estimate did I slap my forehead in frustration. I knew better, but the information wasn't at the top of my mind. Not only had I spent too much on brakes, but I also apparently wasted hours of my time reading about negotiations.

THE TRUTH IS...

Many people fail to absorb books. They love reading, but they miss critical opportunities to apply what they learn. Even my friends who take extensive book notes didn't read them. Only the most diligent note-takers and reviewers get a good return on the time they spent reading.

That's how I knew that I needed to build something to help readers painlessly get more from their books.

Introducing Passages, the reading journal app for nonfiction readers who want to learn and apply their knowledge faster. Download now and get
- The main app, which makes it simple to store and organize your book quotes and notes
- The passage of the day Today widget to help keep your knowledge fresh
- A share extension so you can easily capture quotes from reading apps and the browser

Do your book notes collect dust? Then Passages it a perfect fit. Passages helps you revisit what you read so you can internalize and make use of new knowledge.

Are you a lifelong learner? Do you look to the words of your mentors and role models for inspiration and guidance? You become the average of the people you spend the most time with. Passages lets you spend more time with the people you most admire.

How much does a book cost? The cover might say $19.95, but reading it takes hours. How much are four hours of your life worth? $500? $800? $1000? You can't get that time back, so you better leave with actionable new skills when you close the cover.

If you're like many readers, you quickly forget what you read and hear. For a few days, you can easily recall the contents of the book and even apply it to your life. Over time, the memory goes into long-term storage. You still have the knowledge, but you have to struggle for it.

Sometimes see the same advice over and over. But occasionally we learn something so surprising, so powerful that we know it could change our path. Even so, to internalize it, you must see it multiple times.

Just reading or hearing even the best wisdom isn't enough to get better. Learning means doing. Often, the time we get a piece of information isn't the right time to act on it.

Have you ever wasted your time on something you don't care about? It's easy to get caught up in the busyness of the day and neglect what matters to you. With notifications and a Today Widget, Passages helps you remember your principals and priorities with a daily reminder.

Keep your advisors close. Remind yourself of your most important advisors, whether they be an entrepreneur, spiritual leader, poet, scientist, or even your grandmother. There is no place closer than your iPhone or Apple Watch.

Download Passages today, add a few quotes, turn on the Today Widget, and get the most from your books."

"1239930448";"Slimming Diary";"The Slimming Diary was created for people who approached me that wanted an app which would do everything they wanted when on a diet. The app allows you to monitor the following:

- Activity Monitor - Monitor your daily exercise.
- Body Mass Index - Monitor your BMI.
- Dimension Tracker - Monitors your body dimensions.
- Food Diary - Add everything you eat and it will show you your daily calorie intake.
- Health - Add your BP, temperature and SPO2 values (Vitals).
- Meals - Store your meals for repetitive selecting.
- Recipes - Store your recipes for future use. 
- Shopping List - Automatically adds items to your shopping list when you state you have eaten a meal.
- Summary To Date - Shows weight loss from your entire body.
- Water - Monitor your water intake.
- Weight Tracker - Monitor your weight at regular intervals.
- Your Diary - Simple diary for you to store feelings, events etc for future retrieval.

When you install the app, you must first complete the Settings page together with the Dimension Tracker and then start adding your Meals and Ingredients. It seems like the app takes a lot of configuration, but it's the only way to get an accurate, or as accurate as any app can, to work out your calorie intake and calorie burning during exercise. 

The app was also created for those people who have an iPad 2. The app works on IOS 9.3 and above. It was initially designed for the iPhone 6 mobiles and above, but I since decided to have the app available on the iPad 2 also. 

Future additions:
- Store images of the meals you make for the Recipe and Meals pages.
- Store images of yourself to show the weight loss.
- iCoud integration, so when you update the app on your phone, the same information is available on your iPad.
- Weight Loss Journey - This will be detailed analysis of the calorie intake and calories burned together with other records stored on the app.

Can I assure everyone that absolutely NO information is gathered from this app and passed to anyone on the internet. The only time it contacts the internet is to show help files. This app and the information stored on it is for your eyes only.

Good luck on your weight loss. I hope this application, as it is, and future additions will help you. 

Please, please, please consult with a doctor, physiotherapist, nutritionist etc before you start your slimming regime. You may be doing more harm than good."

"1458937525";"The Daily Journaling";"Spirituality is a broad concept with many perspectives.  It includes a sense of connection to something bigger with more influence, and it involves a quest of search for meaning and sense life.  The spiritual experience is described as sacred or transcendent or simply a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness.

The definition of spiritual life varies from one to another and may change throughout your life, adapting to your own experiences and relationships.   For some, is intricately linked to their association with a church, temple, mosque, or synagogue; where they are guide to search for answers or guided practices.  And for others, it is a prayer or finds comfort in a personal relationship with God or a higher power.  HOWERVER, the overarching umbrella is to seek meaning through their connections and develop a sense of purpose.

 Journaling is, often overlooked, contemplative practice that can help you become more aware of your inner life and feel more connected to your experience and the world around you. Studies show that writing during difficult times may help you find meaning in life’s challenges and become more resilient in the face of obstacles.

Journaling has to be outside the documentation of daily events and shall be extended to deepen the understanding beyond the events.  In healthy Journaling, the daily event as the starting point then we shall deepen our understanding beyond the superficial shell of what happen. 
 
For every recorded event or action in your journal you shall ask 
•	Am I a good person?
•	What is the meaning of this event?
•	What is the connection to the world around me?
•	Does this event happen for a reason?
•	How can I live my life in the best way possible?


Pick up a pen (or keyboard) and start journaling for:

1. Personal and spiritual growth – Explore what you did and how you can do it better.

2. Healing the past -  If you are angry or sad, get out all your feelings. Just get it out and then explore the ability to learn how to do it differently and transform.

3. Set goals and affirmations - Write your goals down in the present tense: ""I am in the best shape of my life,"" and  See the difference?  This affirmation will be making the best.

4. Gratitude - Shift your vibration and feel inspired. Write down all the things as I am grateful for …. It shifts my entire mood and vibe from negative to positive.

5. Being present – No cell phones, no distractions. Open your Heart and your Self up to this moment and see what comes. No sitting in front of the TV or computer. It's not going to happen.

6. Inner guidance & connection to spirit - Explore your Higher Self and connection to spirit. Let your creativity, inspiration, and ideas flow through automatic writing, giving you real guidance about your path and higher purpose.

7. Dream recall - many people don't remember their dreams. Start writing your dreams down first thing when you wake up and this will start to build your dream recall. Dreams contain messages, signs and synchronicities and recording them is a powerful practice.

If you don't know what to write, well, ""WRITE anything.""  Write about your life, things that are bothering you, and your goals and intentions for the future. Please remember that one of the most powerful things that you can do is write about what you are grateful for."

"1453321786";"Mindful Leader Journaling App";"This app was developed to support participants on the Genos Mindful Leader Program; but it's now offered to anyone who wants to harness the power of journaling for their self-development. 

If you'd like to complete the self-paced version of the Mindful Leader program online at NO COST you can sign up here: https://genosopportunity.com/ml 

The Mindful Leader Journaling App provides a simple way to structure your daily journaling.  First select the type of journaling you want to do today: self-awareness, vision, or gratitude.  The app will then present you with a random prompt from the category you've selected and ask how long you wish to journal for. When you click 'let's go' the app times you through the journaling approach explained in the app.  Simple.  Effective.

The app will support your development in three specific areas:

Self-Awareness: The core of both mindfulness and emotional intelligence is self-awareness.  An extremely effective way to develop a deep self-awareness is through daily journaling, even for a few minutes, using prompts designed to help you dive deep into who you are.  The Mindful Leader Journal App offers you 70 carefully designed prompts that will help you build a deeper self-awareness than you've ever had before.

Vision: Do you know what you want to be in the world?  Have you a clear idea where you're heading?  Is every day of your life an intentional step in the direction of a clear life's mission?  If not, then the vision option in the Mindful Leader Journaling App is going to change your life.  40 well-designed prompts will help you explore your ideal life, your vision, who you really want to be and what you really want to do in the world.

Gratitude: The benefits of gratitude journaling are well-established in the research. According to one study, a five-minute a day gratitude journaling practice can increase your long-term well-being by more than 10 percent – which is about the same impact as income increase of 10!  Practicing development of a solid sense of gratitude for all that is right with our lives has been shown to improve health, relationships, emotions, personality, and career.  
We've assembled a set of 35 prompts that will help you explore every aspect of your life, helping you to build a strong sense of gratitude that will enhance your resilience and happiness."

"6443824276";"My Birth Journal";"A super exciting way to chronical and preserve your pregnancy journey while utilizing an innovative communication method to share your real time pregnancy announcements and updates with your family and friends through push notifications.  The App also provides a one-of-a-kind Delivery Tracker with access to contraction timers and feeding, diaper change, sleep, and tummy time logs once the baby arrives.
While sitting in a waiting room anxiously awaiting the arrival of my best friend’s first grandchild, I couldn’t help but wonder what is going on in there. I began to think there has to be an easy way for a parent to update their family and friends with ease but not distract from their beautiful moment. And that was the inspiration for the Delivery Tracker within the app.

The Delivery Tracker is comprised of 10 pre-programmed notifications while in labor. With just a few clicks and in seconds, the parent or partner can bring their village along on the journey.  Keep them up-to-date whether contractions have begun, the drive has started to the hospital or birthing center, water broke, dilated/effaced, epidural time, time to push, having a C-section and most importantly when the baby has arrived.  Your family and friends will anxiously await your play-by-play and can cheer you on as you experience one of the most memorable days of your life.

Summary: 

	•	Parents chronical and archive their pregnancy journey (entries can be marked private). 
	•	By using a unique code provided by the expectant parents, family and friends download the app to walk alongside the parent during their birth journey.
	•	Parents designate each user as Close Family, Family, or Friend.
	•	When the parent decides to provide an update, a push notification is sent to family and friends.
	•	Keeping family and friends informed and engaged during this exciting time!

How it works: 
	•	The share child code feature allows you to send the code you selected at registration with your family and friends. It gives you the opportunity to share updates with only those family and friends that use your code to download the My Birth Journal app.
	•	The define group option allows you to designate each contact that downloads the My Birth Journal app into a specified group, close family, family and friends. With this option, you choose which group(s) get notifications. As an example, for more personal or sensitive information, you may only want to share with those contacts you added to your “close family” group.
	•	Items that can be shared within the app:
	•	Gender Reveal
	•	Dr. appointment updates
	•	Baby journal updates
	•	The Delivery Tracker 
	•	Picture and videos
	•	The parent can also add their baby registries so friends and family have single click access to your registry
	•	Includes a contraction tracker that allows you to track the number, duration and frequency of your contractions. 
	•	The tracker will record the total number of contractions in a daily 24-hour period and resets at midnight. Once you have recorded multiple contractions, the number of contractions, the average duration and frequency are recorded for the past hour.  
	•	And once the baby is born, there are feeding, sleeping, diaper change and tummy time logs with 7-14-30 day reporting of the entries in the logs so you can determine any trends or patterns.
	•	Registration only requires your name, email (to verify you) and due date. We do not store passwords and we will only use the data provided for analytics. You can be assured your information will not be shared with any outside 3rd parties. Our privacy policy is included in the app on the registration page for your review.

"1126389151";"Snappylog - Quick daily diary";"SnappyLog : Allowing you to create Logs and save memories quickly.

Even when you don't have the time or there's nothing special you can just rate the day. Something is better than nothing ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever started writing diaries, but eventually stopped?

Usually, it's because it's getting harder to find things to write about, and after skipping writing for a few days, you forget about the diary altogether.

Snappylog tries to fix that.

We need logs that are quick, ""snappy"", to enter. Something that feels quicker and easier, less effortful than traditional diaries.

So when you start to enter a daily log in Snappylog, instead of being shown a blank sheet of white, forcing you to write out long, effortful essays, you are instead asked to rate your satisfaction of today, from 1-5.

Yes. And you can leave it at that, if you want.
At least that's some data, right?

If you want to add more, that's fine. We've got ""Briefs"", where you enter brief texts, mark them as good or bad, add photos* to them, or even elaborate on them into a full length description. The flexibility allows you to recall your day quicker and easier.

For maximum adherence to forming a habit, logs for a day should be entered before midnight, before the day ends.

Other not-really-a-feature features
- Search through your entries according to rating, impact, or entry details.
- Configure reminder times as you find useful. 
- Backup and Restore database via iTunes File Sharing
- Export database for safekeeping

Feel free to suggest new features.

As always, some memories are fleeting. Simple, brief, messages can help you recall some of the more whimsical things in life.

* Photos are compressed to 300x300 px to have minimal impact on storage. Snappylog emphasizes on capturing the ""feel"" of the day, thus high resolution is not required."

Moody Journal also let's you optionally write detailed notes, attach images and even audio recordings to your diary entries. Each entry will be saved with a date and a time, but you are free to change these around as you see fit. Get journaling!

Keep the streak going
The key to great journaling is consistency. Watch your streak grow every day you complete a diary entry in Moody Journal.

It's hard to put moods into words. It's especially hard to do so when looking back at a diary entry that's months, or even years, old. Journaling can be so much more. Save the moment, attach a special photo.
Or make it personal and record a message that your future self will read when looking back through your diary.

Mood Calendar
Moody Journal has an elegant calendar view that acts as a chronological mood-tracker and let's you quickly spot trends over a period of time. Tap on a day to jump to the diary entries for that day.

Mood Statistics
Insightful statistics will help you learn more about yourself, maintain your mood-tracker journaling streak, identify common mood and activity combinations, and more.

Diary Reminders
Always stay on top of your journaling with daily diary reminders. You can set up your own at any time that works for you.

Journal entries
Each diary entry you complete will be associated with a mood. You can associate each mood with a color, and the mood tracker will adjust the entries' color to match that of the mood.

Your diary, your way
Everything in Moody Journal is customizable. You can change your moods, activities, colors, icons and so much more. Change it in one place and the mood-tracker will update it everywhere.

Cloud sync
Keep your diary safe in the cloud. Back it up and restore it to any device with Moody Journal installed.

"1431522193";"MealSnap: Photo Food Diary";"This app is NOT counting calories. In MealSnap you snap your meals and add a short description, and that's it. It will take you less than 30 seconds, promise.

Most food diary apps require you to enter protein, fat, and carb content or search in the database for each meal. It just doesn't work - it's not what you want to do before family dinner.

Log food without any distraction. Just snap a photo with iPhone's camera and add it to the MealSnap later from the photo library. Setting time and date is on us. It's that easy.

Follow basic healthy eating principles. Check intervals between meals, eat fewer products from the 'red' zone: sugar, pastry, fatty food and eat more from the 'green' zone: veggies, greens, nuts, and seeds. MealSnap will help you with that - you can easily understand if the meal is healthy or not by the photo, intervals between meals are on us.

MealSnap will be very useful on your next visit to the nutritionist - it has enough data to help him make recommendations for you.

It's just the beginning, and a lot of cool features are coming, such as stats, automatic meal recognition, training tracking, and personalized recommendations from best nutrition experts.

We would love to hear your feedback - reach us via built-in chat on the Settings tab.

"919172608";"Pain Tracker & Diary";"WHY DID WE MAKE THIS?
You hurt. Your pain is chronic and complicated. You can’t remember everything. You want your doctors to understand, but you don’t know how to explain what you feel.

PAIN IS LIFE-CHANGING. HELP IS HERE.
Nanolume® developed the Pain Tracker & Diary to help you record the daily textures, intensities, and locations of what you feel, so you and your care team can better understand what you are suffering with and follow how your pain responds to medications and treatments.

TRACK IT BETTER. TREAT IT BETTER.
Pain is a complex experience. It often includes multiple pain types (layers), each with its own unique texture, intensity, location, and surface area.

By keeping a diary that integrates complex information, you can show your doctors what you are experiencing to help them make a better diagnosis, choose more appropriate medications and treatments, and monitor if your treatments are beneficial. In addition, by keeping such an integrated record, trends might emerge that would otherwise go unnoticed.  

PAIN IS DIFFERENT.
Pain is a subjective (not objective) sensation that you cannot measure. Its assessment relies on each person’s ability to communicate what they feel. Nanolume® developed this digital diary to help you record what you feel every day. 

INCLUDED FEATURES.
For each diary entry you create:
• Choose a Pain Type. Choose from a list of predefined pain types or create a customized pain type. Next, tap the icon of the pain type you feel is most intense (you can come back and add more types later).
• Select the Intensity. Select the intensity of your pain type using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).
• Draw an Outline. Use your finger to draw an “outline” of the type of pain you are experiencing on the front and back sides of a generalized map of your body.
• Calculated Surface Areas. The app displays the percent [%] of your body surface affected by each (or all) of the pain types you draw.
• Zoom. Need to see a larger image of your hand or foot? Double-tap: ""once"" to zoom x2; ""twice"" to zoom x4; ""a third time"" to restore the image to its original size.  We also offer pinch-to-zoom.
• Notes. Tap the “Notepad” icon located in the top-left corner of each opened diary entry to record any details of your medications or treatment results.
• Tap ""Add Pain."" Choose another pain type (layer) to draw.
• Save Your Diary Entry. Tap ""Done"" to create a snapshot of all the pain type layers you drew. The app attaches the date and time your entry was saved.
• Open a Saved Entry. Tap on the date and time of the entry you want to review. Look at the intensity, location, and surface area of each distinct pain type you experienced (by touching the icon of the pain type you want to see) or see all the pain types at once and see how they overlap (tap the ""All Layers"" icon). Swipe the picture left or right to check how your other saved pain entries compare over time.
• Charts. View a summary of your data in ""Charts.""
• Forget to Save an Entry? Go back and recreate a ""pain picture"" from the past; then, use the ""Calendar"" icon to backdate the recreated entry.
• Calendar Backdating. Touch the ""Calendar"" icon to backdate any pain-picture you draw to create a record of what you remember from the past.
• Copy/Edit. Copy or edit a copy of a previous entry.
• CSV Export. Email or save a numeric file of your data, then open that data in a spreadsheet.
• Interactive Summary & Animation. Play an animation of your data to see how each or all of your pain types change within any period you choose by selecting the corresponding start/stop dates.
• PDF Export. Export your charts, drawings, and notes as a PDF file.

PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT.

You can browse each entry in a journal by swiping left or right. You can delete an entry anytime by pressing the delete icon. This will remove the picture from your photo library or print an entry by pressing the share icon. 

You can also view the journal in slideshow with adjustable auto scrolling speed. (You can show the slideshow on Apple TV by connecting your phone to an Apple TV)

Unless you have been specifically asked by your clinician to use this app, we would recommend taking a look at our A&D Heart Track app, which has been designed for home blood pressure monitoring.

An ambulatory blood pressure study is considered the best way to diagnose blood pressure related issues. It is performed using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor, a special type of blood pressure monitor that automatically measures your blood pressure at a set interval for a period of time, typically 24 hours.

The A&D Heart Track Pro ABPM system provides healthcare providers with a modern, integrated, and digital-first approach to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

Unless you have been specifically asked by your clinician to use this app, we would recommend taking a look at other apps that have been designed for home blood pressure monitoring.

An ambulatory blood pressure study is considered the best way to diagnose blood pressure related issues. It is performed using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor, a special type of blood pressure monitor that automatically measures your blood pressure at a set interval for a period of time, typically 24 hours.

The Tracky Pro ABPM system provides healthcare providers with a modern, integrated, and digital-first approach to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

This Tracky Pro Diary app allows you to record your observations during an ambulatory blood pressure study, such as daily activities, sleep time, and sleep quality. These observations are transmitted securely to your clinician, allowing them to quickly and easily contextualize your blood pressure measurements and increase the accuracy of your ambulatory blood pressure study.

MEDICAL DISCLAIMER: The Tracky Pro Diary app is not intended for the diagnosis of or screening for hypertension.

Go on a Shadow Hunt and take photos of Cool Shadows. Create a Mystery Shadows matching game by photographing objects and the shadows they make. With tools for children to record their observations, the Shadows Journal playfully introduces children to the science of shadows.

Features
• Documents photos of cool shadows children create or find in photo albums
• Gives prompts for shadow scavenger hunts
• Creates a shadow matching game for friends to play
• Aligns with research-based early science learning trajectories
• No in-app purchases
• No advertising

This app is designed for children to to strengthen their science investigation skills and explore the concepts of shadows as they:
• Understand that a shadow is seen when a light shines on a surface and an object blocks some of that light.
• Identify objects that are blocking light and their shadows.
• Understand that shadows can be made using different sources of light, including natural lights (like the sun) and those made by people (like lamps and flashlights).
• Describe how the shape of a shadow changes when a light source shines on different sides of an object.
• Observe how a shadow is different when cast on one surface or multiple surfaces.
• Understand that a shadow’s size changes when the distance between the light source and an object changes.
• Understand how a shadow’s length and shape change when the position or angle of the light source changes.
• Make predictions and carry out experiments about how a shadow will change when the light source's distance, position, or angle change.

The Shadows Journal and the entire Shadows curriculum supplement from Early Science with Nico & Nor™ was rigorously researched and developed specifically for preschool classroom use. The Shadows unit contains two apps: Shadow Play and the Shadows Journal. In Shadow Play, children help put on a shadow theater show and discover how shadows change location, size, and shape.

Each Early Science with Nico & Nor curriculum supplement combines traditional classroom activities with digital learning to promote young children’s engagement with age-appropriate science practices and concepts during circle time, learning centers, read-aloud book sessions, snack time, and outdoor play!

Sometimes, when it feels like things are not going well or getting better, your own negativity can drag you down.

It shouldn’t be this way, we are only on this earth for a short time.

Recently, I went through a dark period, nothing was going right for me and I was spiralling downwards.

A self help book I was reading suggested I write down one thing I was grateful for each day.  

So, I did. No matter how small, most days. When I checked my list in the morning, I started the day on a positive note.

More positive things happened in my life, so I kept going and now I see a lot more joy - even in the small things.

If you’d like to see more of the good things in your life, attract more positive people and be happier, follow these instructions:

1. Download and Install the app.
2. Add 10 of your favourite memories from your photos and explain why they made you happy.
3. Capture one thing that makes you happy each day. Look out for them, they are there.

"1523268654";"Healthy Bladder-Voiding Diary";"If you have hard time peeing or have been seeing an increase in ""gotta go"" urgency feeling, check your bladder health through voiding diary!

** Your first step to a healthier bladder - Voiding Diary **

Having a voiding diary can be helpful because it describes your daily habits, your urinary symptoms and demonstrates how they are affecting your life.

The diary helps you track a number of things: when and how much fluid you drink, when and how much you urinate, how often you have that “gotta go” urgency feeling, and when and how much urine you may leak.

Start tracking with just your smartphone - no additional hardware necessary!

WHY YOU WILL LOVE SOUNDABLE DIARY:
1. It's easy peesy! - Stand in front of the toilet, unzip, and let nature take its course. Our app will take care of the rest.
2. It's battle-tested! - this diary uses the technology clinically validated in multiple sites. We analyzed over 35,000 cases of pee from 4,700 people. 
3. Act fast! - Understanding your urinary symptoms means that you can fear less and act fast to seek professional care. Get on with your life with SOUNDABLE DIARY

HOW TO USE
1. (Man)Stand in front of the toilet
(Woman)Sit on the toilet and spread your knees shoulder-width apart.
2. (Man) Keep your phone 3 feet away. Point the bottom of your phone toward the toilet.
(Woman) Sit back a little, hold your phone in your hand and place it on your lap
3. Press 'Start' to begin measurement 
4. Make sure to aim for the water (not the sides!)

"1643225869";"Saga: Your Heroic Diary";"Keep your thoughts organized:
A journal can be frightening at first, but it is one of the most effective ways to organize your ideas. To begin, open a new journal and concentrate on one thought. Write down what you think that notion means, why you think it's essential or not, and how you can utilize it to help you achieve your goals. With Saga Journaling Prompts, you can start to grasp what your thoughts represent and how they can help you.

Create Goals and Grow:
Many people say that writing down your goals will help you achieve them, and this couldn't be more true. You give your ideas life by writing them down and promising yourself that you will work on them. Journaling goals will help you remember what is most important to you right now. You'll notice that some of the goals you re-write become more specific, while others change or are forgotten entirely. Set ""SMART"" goals while you're at it: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.

From Confidence to Creativity:
Writing a journal is an excellent way to express yourself creatively. Everyone has the ability to be creative; most of us just haven't realized it yet. The best place to begin exploring your inner creativity is in your journal. Journaling boosts confidence on multiple levels. It makes you more at ease with yourself as you learn more about yourself and your surroundings. If you journal on a regular basis, you will noticeably improve your ability to express yourself, and expressing yourself in any medium is essential for creativity. You become more eager to create once your confidence has been boosted a little. Anything that comes to mind should be written down. Allow your imaginations to run wild and document it in Journey."

Now one of the leading literary journals published in English, it is read all over the world—and forms the nexus of a warm and active community.

We believe that the great art that has emerged from these faith traditions is dramatic, not didactic—incarnational, not abstract. And so our focus has been on works of imagination that embody a spiritual struggle, like Jacob wrestling with the angel. In our pages the larger questions of existence intersect with what the poet Albert Goldbarth calls the “greasy doorknobs and salty tearducts” of our everyday lives.

Pricing for subscriptions available:

"1450404769";"VideoDiary Application";"Video Diary makes a daily video record with a purpose, direction, and goal in mind.

How does it work, in three points!
The first point to mention is that with every video that you take, you can set a couple of questions to be asked about during the recording. These questions are called Focus Questions, you can decide whenever those questions are asked with a simple tap and answer them accordingly.
With this, you can bring some order to the recording session. Or you can ignore the questions and just record the video... but then you'll miss out on the second point.

The second point to mention is the way that you can view the video. Video Diary will keep track of when the Focus Questions are asked during the recording session and enable you to skip directly to that specific part of the video with the question and your answer to it.
The other thing is your speech will be automatically transcribed into text using speech recognition. This will give you an overview of all your answers to all the focus questions. There is no need to search and watch parts of the video recording that are of no interest. This will enhance the replay value of the video when you only want to see a specific moment in the video.
Recording a video is one goal, but learning from it should be the second goal to aim for.

The third point to mention is ordering and accessing the videos. VideoDiary organizes all the videos in a specific way which allows you to quickly access them using the default calendar mode. Which as the name implies orders all the videos by creation date.
Or you can use the search mode. At the start of the recording session you'll be asked about your mood and to choose an emoji to represent your feeling. This is the first search option, you'll always remember the happy days... or the sad days.
The second search option, with each Focus Question that you provide you can set a tag value to that specific question and with the search option, you can find all the videos where that question is asked. For example, you can choose to be asked about sport and exercise on certain days, with the search option you can quickly find those days and review the results.
In the third search option, you can always mark a video with a star status and search all videos with this status.

These are the three main points about Video Diary. Recording a video, organize the content of the video, and replay the video to learn something from it.


The last thing to mention is memory management. All the videos are stored on your iCloud account. When you record a video every day a lot of memory will be consumed on your device, as the default VideoDiary will choose to store all your videos on your iCloud account to save space on your device. After 1-2 weeks the video will be removed from your device and re-downloaded when you request it for a view.
By using your iCloud account as storage, you'll not have to deal with any external services or subscription fees.

With every recorded video you'll see the video size in MB. The recording quality is set to medium as default to provide you good quality and also reasonable video file size.

"1573920118";"CalendART Subliminal AI Diary";"Subliminal art with CalendART!

? CalendART App is a new generation artificial intelligence-supported bullet journal & mood tracker. What you have to do is very simple. First of all, you should examine the photos in different compositions, different colors, different concepts, and different objects that we have specially selected for you. Match it with just one of these photos, thinking about the day you want to set your mood. There may be a color, a composition or a detail to be associated with that day in the photographs. That's all. Then I analyze this photo for you with the support of artificial intelligence and present you the results. You create your own art with your subconscious choices. Because all our choices, decisions, and thoughts are related to our subconscious.

? In a normal mood tracker app, you enter the data. They will ask you how you are feeling today. CalendART asks which of these is your day. That’s why CalendART App is not a regular mood tracker or bullet journal. Because you don't choose outcomes. The results are shaped according to your preferences. Because we know very well that people cannot always be honest enough with themselves. But people's subconscious choices include much more honesty. Data created with an objective approach can be analyzed in a healthier way.

? What will CalendART tell you after your selected photos are analyzed?
• Mood: The photo you choose with artificial intelligence is analyzed and your mood for that day is determined.
• The photos you choose are analyzed according to the preferences of other users and it is determined how popular you are.
• The colors, objects, locations, and similar details that you unwittingly seek in a photograph are analyzed and presented to you in the form of graphics through the photographs you have chosen.
• You can create an annual bullet journal with the colors taken from the photos you choose. So you can see your favorite colors of those years.
• You can share the results of your daily choices with all the details on social media with a single click.
• In the Stats section, you can analyze the graphical outputs in 4 different time periods: weekly, monthly, yearly and all-time average.
• In the Settings section, you can make detailed settings such as changing the theme, setting the notification time, feedback section, and data management.

? The people we meet in our lives, the events and conditions we experience are the result of our thoughts. Negative or positive, every thought recorded in the subconscious will happen one day. We must be aware of the power of the subconscious in order to be free in the journey of life and draw our own route.

If you have any questions or suggestions on how we can improve the app, please feel free to contact us via our social media accounts.

"1097379123";"Life Calendar Journal";"""Journaling apps are typically about capturing moments or getting your thoughts down on paper as often as you can. Life Calendar takes a slightly different approach, and instead works as means to memorialize a week at a time."" — Lifehacker

""Life Calendar encourages you to look past your schedule and log your thoughts on the past week."" — Netted

Life Calendar helps you visualize your life by breaking it down to weeks and displaying it in a grid. Each week is symbolized by a little box, and each box can be color coded. Notes can be added to each week, and with them you can capture any thoughts, dwellings, feelings, or reflections you cherish during that time. 

Features

• Your entire life’s weeks, one by one, visualized in a grid.
• Cherish your life by adding a note to every week.
• One note every week, 52 notes every year.
• Define each week with color by choosing from a growing array.
• Take and store snapshots of your entire life, either in weeks or in years.
• Export your notes and save them anywhere by using Life Notebooks.
• Add images and moods to your weeks.
• Store your Life Calendar with accounts and keep it backed up and available across multiple devices.
• Custom reminders make sure you never forget to take a note.
• Use tags to give meanings to your colors
• Lock your app with a 4 digit code

Imagine the perspective you'd get on your life if you keep taking weekly notes for a year or two! Wouldn't that be really helpful?

******************

Pro Upgrade:

For heavy users of Life Calendar, you can optionally upgrade to a Pro account to unlock features like adding an unlimited number of cards per week or adding audio and video notes. Subscriptions are available for $1.99 monthly or $15.99 yearly (the exact price varies by region).

Payment for Pro Upgrades will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

Lumen Trails lets you take notes, make lists and keep track of other things in your life such as time, workouts, expenses, calories, food, weight, sleep or anything else you can think of, even where you've parked your car. Thousands of people use it every day, and they love it because it truly makes a difference in their lives. 

“I've been using Lumen Trails for 6 months and continue to love it. One of my most sticky and useful apps ever on my phone.” – David D'Souza

The beauty of Lumen Trails is that you can track absolutely anything. There are tons of other apps that allow you to track one or two things, for example, calories and weight. But what if you decide to track something else? Say, how many cigarettes you smoke as you try to quit, your eating habits or even net worth? Lumen Trails is the app for that! 

Instead of having one app for your to-do lists, one for tracking expenses, another one for tracking your weight, you can declutter your home screen and just have one app that does it all. 

Designed exclusively for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, Lumen Trails is incredibly powerful, easy to use, and looks beautiful on the Retina Display. It can even backup your data automatically to Google Drive, sync with iCloud, and is fully accessible with Apple VoiceOver in 8 languages. There's nothing that comes even close to it. And to top it all, your data is not locked on your iPhone. You can export it to Excel or Google Docs.

So what's truly important to you right now? Your Health? Fitness? Finances? Productivity? 

Track it and get things done!

"1617481435";"Santa Diary";"Santa Diary is a Christmas-themed app for children that helps promote journaling, reflection, and self-regulation. You and your child can do the following:

1. Work together to create daily diary entries.
2. Write and receive letters from Santa.
3. Set goals and find out if they're on the nice or naughty list.

Each day your child is asked two simple but important questions like

- Tell me about your day?
- What was one thing that made you smile today?
- What was one kind thing you did for someone today?
- What was one thing you learned today?

It's a way of processing a variety of their emotions and reactions. After the child completes a certain number of questions within a category, they will receive a letter from a Christmas Elf. This letter is customized by the parent/guardian to include specific details about that child. It's all about making the child feel heard and giving meaningful feedback.

They can also write and receive letters from Santa, complete goals set by Santa's elves, and check if they are on the nice or naughty list. All of this feedback is customized by the parent/guardian within a password-protected area of the app.

All icons on this app are created by Freepik from Flaticon. These include all Christmas, dinosaurs, animals, and sports-related icons."

----------

The inspiration behind FoodyLife is that nowadays people pay little attention to what they eat and often eat unhealthy food. Although there are many similar apps on the market (e.g. Fitness App, Calorie counter...), most of them focus mainly on “numbers”, such as how many calories the user has eaten and how long the user should exercise to get rid of those calories, or sending the user notifications when they should get up to exercise or if they have eaten too much.

FoodyLife’ is an app that helps users track their daily diet by allowing them to keep their own food diary. The app shows neither calories nor numbers; instead, users have only to take a picture, enter their diet information, then they are able their overall diet balance. It is very simple and highly effective. Users can explore their eating habits visually, improving self-consciousness about eating habits."

This version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.

Useful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.

This app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.

Created by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.

That means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.

Enough about me, back to the app!

Features:
+   iCloud Sync Support
+   Universal App
+   Highly Customizable
+   Easy to use 
+   Track unlimited conditions
+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day
+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)
+   Edit past entries

ANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY

TRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.

A common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. 

METRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.

 -- MEDICATION TRACKING --
+   Basic medication tracking.

 -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --
+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.

 -- HISTORY --
+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.
+   Fully searchable.
+   Day View

 -- GRAPHS --
+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.
+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.

 -- REPORTS --
+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.
+   Include Graph
+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions
+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar
+   Include Medication Log
+   Include Important Events

 -- TOOLS --
+   Automatic Weather Fetching
+   Pain Scale Editor
+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric

We recommend logging your mood at least once but preferably 2-3 times a day. You should at least log any drastic changes in your mood and factors which make you feel that way. 

Choose from a list of color coded moods and attach optional positive or negative emotions you might be feeling. Add activities on what you have been up to. Describe the weather if you like. You can also add photos and notes to the logs. 

MoodWell uses the recorded moods, activities and weather data to present interesting statistics on your mental health. The graphs and calendar show how your mood changes over a period of time. After logging a few times, you will get valuable insights like - which weekdays do you usually feel your best, which ones are the worst, which months of the year are your best and worst, which activities you do more often when you feel good and which ones make you feel not too good. Are you usually in a worse mood when it's cold and gloomy outside? Are you more energetic when it's sunny?

The color coded Year in Pixels chart shows you how you have felt on every single day throughout the year similar to an old school diary.

These insights will help you understand your mental health better. You can also use the search function to look for specific items - hastags can be used to make the search super powerful. For example:

#n will search for all logs with notes
#p will search for all logs with photos

"1644647667";"Practice Journal App";"The Practice Journal app is a powerful tool for individuals who want to maintain a daily practice routine and track their progress over time. With this app, users can create a journal card to document their daily practice sessions.

To get started, users can choose their areas of interest, such as mindfulness, yoga, or meditation. Then, they can add a cue, which is a reminder or trigger that prompts them to start their practice session. They can also add a craving, which is the reason they want to engage in the practice, and a reward, which is the benefit they will receive upon completing the session.

The app also includes a streaks feature, which allows users to track how many consecutive days they have completed their practice sessions. This can be a great motivator for those who want to maintain a consistent practice routine.

Users can set weekly targets for themselves, such as a certain number of practice sessions per week, and the app will provide reminders to help them stay on track.

To ensure that users stay focused during their practice sessions, the app also includes timed practice sessions. Users can set the duration of their practice session, and the app will provide a countdown timer to help them stay on track.

Finally, the app includes a timebox feature, which allows users to set a specific time period during which they will engage in their practice sessions. This can be useful for individuals who have busy schedules and want to make sure they have time for their practice every day.

Overall, the Practice Journal app is a comprehensive tool for individuals who want to maintain a daily practice routine, track their progress, and achieve their goals."

"1518014927";"Arduino Science Journal";"The Arduino Science Journal (formerly Science Journal, an initiative by Google) is free and allows you to gather data about the world around you by harnessing the sensors in your smartphone as well as sensors connected to Arduino. The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.

The Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.

About Arduino Science Journal
With the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.

•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared
•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! 
•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science
•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! 
•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science

With built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. 

Together with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.

The app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!

If you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.

Permissions notice:

• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.
• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.
• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.
• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.
• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.

Benefits of using the Arduino Science Journal
• It’s free and simple to use
• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors
• Cross-platform support
• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you
• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway 
• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board
• Google Drive integration, as well as local download

A memory book is a throwback to your day to day life. It helps to write about your special day with pictures. Our memory is a perfect world than the universe: it gives back life to those who no longer exist. Write for no one else but you, help to identify yourself. When we write things down we tend to have an easier time remembering them and recalling that day more precisely. The more things you can tie together into a narrative, the more easily you'll be able to recall those things later on. 

This moment can be positive or negative. As you think of them, note the details you recall. It may be your friend's birthday party or a date or an anniversary or anything unforgettable. The specific details make this gift personal. When you've got a few things you'd like to write, start jotting down the memories in a memory book. Also, add your photo memories. 

Those can be travel photos, group photos with your friends, or any private photos that you want to keep secure under a passcode. After a long time, these memories help us to remember those happy/sad moments.


In this hectic world, we forget most things within time. The memory book contains an event planner. It set up a reminder to alert your events such as birthdays, anniversaries, appointments, or any other events. The user receives a notification on the allocated event day. It is also possible to reschedule events if any change occurred.

"1386298462";"Climber Diary";"Climber Diary is here to help you to climb even harder! Track your sessions and training, visualize your climbing progress and identify those points that will make you climb the next level!

+ Easy climbing session capture

This is the only app that allows you to effortlessly add and track all your climbing sessions (during or after the session) including specific details such as the climbing style, date and duration of the session, location and session “mood”.

Within each session, you will be able to add the ‘grades’ of each of your climbs plus your view about the style of the climb (i.e. ‘pumpy’, ‘crimpy’ or ‘balancy’). Other cool features are that you can add the mood of the session (good session, ok one or horrible session), if your session was indoors or outdoors and if you were bouldering, leading or top roping.

Adding all these data to your session is a matter of seconds as the app has been designed to minimise the amount of time you spend logging the climb. After all is about climbing not inputting data!

+ Track your progress

Climber Diary contains a unique setting that allows you to visualise your climbing performance weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly so that you can easily visualise your evolution, identify your pinpoints and focus your training. You can also compare these climbs against the same previous period (e.g. last week with this week). 

We have built the app so that it supports all these grading standards : ‘Hueco’, ‘French’, ‘British Technical’, ‘Yosemite Decimal System’, ‘UIAA’, 'Australia', 'RSA' or ‘Font’

+ Profile

You can create and update your profile as you want even adding a photo make it more personal. 

+ Climbing gym passes

You can also add and scan your favourite climbing centre passes, either a barcode or QR code, which will help all of you who tend to forget their membership cards.

+ Grade Calculator

One last thing that we have added is a grade calculator to help you figure out what each grade means in other standards.

+ More coming soon!
We are always updating the app so please feel free to let us know your thoughts by sending an email to alex [at] climberdiary.com"

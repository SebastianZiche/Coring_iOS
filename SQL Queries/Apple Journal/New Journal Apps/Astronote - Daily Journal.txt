App Description
Astronote is a simple and comprehensive daily journal.

You can track daily emotions and activities, journal and reflect, keep daily tasks, and stay on top of life goals.


Astronote is the journal of choice for those looking for a tool to help with self-reflection, self-growth, and goal-setting.

The Journal gives you space to write about your day but also gives you prompts to help with self-reflection. Memorable entries can be marked as “Major Life Events”. You can also upload a daily photo to record meaningful moments.

The Habit Tracker allows you to track your day-to-day emotions, hobbies, activities, meals, weather, chores, and more. Giving you the ability to look back and reflect on the days you felt the happiest at a glance.

There's also To-Do List functionality built into the app, which can also be turned off and removed from the user experience. The task list can be set to refresh daily or carry incomplete tasks to the next day.

Within the Life Goals section, users are able to keep track of their life goals. The idea was to bring project management to goal setting, allowing users to mark Target Completion Dates, Goal Status, and Steps to reach the goal.

Patterns and statistics functionality is coming soon to Astronote. Meaning that users will be able to view frequent hobbies within the last week, month, and year.

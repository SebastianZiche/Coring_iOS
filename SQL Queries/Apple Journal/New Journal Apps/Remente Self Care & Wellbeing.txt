    We have also added Siri! You can create shortcuts to your goals, so if you just did something awesome but also your hands are really tired, you can open up a goal without using them! (You still have to use your hands to actually add anything to your goal, but still, cool stuff right?)

    A few bugs have been zapped into oblivion and to celebrate we gave our owl-icon a brand new color scheme.

    Finally, we have added a reason to get up in the morning!
    We added a morning-screen that gently reminds you to make a kickass plan for the day. On top of the little nudge nudge, you get little life-hacky insight each morning that you can apply to your planning or to your day (or life in general, we donât discriminate).

    ----------------
    New Features!

    A new design.
    The Remente app has a completely new design created to further increase your experience.

    Improved Offline mode.
    You are now able to use the Remente app offline. Certain features still require internet connection to function properly and content require internet connection to be accessed, such as courses and boosts. However, If you have visited a course recently, it may be available offline as well, depending on how much memory you have on your phone.

    Goal Creation
    The new goal system is designed to help you maximise the chance of you succeeding with your goals. You can add images to the goals and to your progress as you develop.
    The new Autoplan function allows you to create a recurring task and then choose when you want it to appear in your day plan. You can plan to have a task appear any number of weekdays in between two specific dates, so you can plan your goals weeks in advance and not forget to take action when the time comes.
    Alongside the Autoplanner you can also set independent reminders for each task. You can add as many reminders as you like to a single or a recurring task. So if you have planned to do a task twice a week for a month, you can set 1, 2, 3 or even 10 reminders each week if you want to.
    Each goal has an individual journal in which your progress is automatically kept track of. You have the option to add notes and images to each post so you can reflect, learn and get motivated as you progress.

    The Day Planner
    Located in the me tab, the Day Planner is a smart and dynamic To-Do List that helps you keep your day-to-day focus. You can add tasks and to-doâs on the day and also add tasks you planned inside your goals. The Autoplan function mentioned above helps you automate the planning process significantly.
    You can also postpone a task by dragging it into the âdo somedayâ column, where it remains until you add it to your day plan or delete it.

    Goal Gallery
    A simple and nice way to browse our expertly crafted goal templates is possible in the new goal gallery view. Tap a goal to see what it contains and accept it by tapping the âaccept goalâ button.
    You can determine beforehand when you want the goal to start if you want to keep your goals spaced out during a longer period of time.

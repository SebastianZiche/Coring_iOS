App Description
Simple Log is a journal, diary, and log service that lets you track and record moments, habits, and routines throughout your day — quickly and easily.

=============

Use it to build habits, document reflections, as a work or business log, or a hobby journal. Anytime you want to document something for later reference, Simple Log is the right tool!

New Entries: Adding a new entry is a snap with the template feature. Create templates for common entry types and add them with just a few taps. For example, keeping track of exercise days or appointments. A set template helps you to create a new entry using a set form so that each entry is consistent.

Images and Audio: Attach images or record audio and attach to entries with ease. Each entry is automatically stamped with the date, time, and location.

Search and Filter: Filters allow you to configure fast searches, so you can recall specific entries quickly and easily. The entries can be charted and exported as CSV.

Mobile and web connection: Share and access data quickly between a website or mobile app. Everything backed up safely to the cloud. You can lose your phone, but not your data!

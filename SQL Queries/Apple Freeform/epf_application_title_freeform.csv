"311715910";"Basketball WhiteBoard";"Now updated for iOS 7 and 64-bit support!

Basketball WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase basketball coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the court!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the court you'd like (or leave it at a full-court display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the ice at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" letters OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in the summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of its kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  
Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Basketball WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Basketball WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the court (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the court (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the court, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Basketball WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Basketball WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the court? Use Basketball WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

Field Hockey WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase field hockey coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Based on Hockey WhiteBoard (originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009),  it is one of the original applications of it's kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Field Hockey WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Field Hockey WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Field Hockey WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Field Hockey WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Field Hockey WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

"314066510";"Soccer WhiteBoard";"Now updated for iOS 7 and 64-bit support!

Soccer WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase soccer coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of it's kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Soccer WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Soccer WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Soccer WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Soccer WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Soccer WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

"308950002";"Hockey WhiteBoard";"Now built for iOS 7 and later with 64-bit support!

Hockey WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and puck positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase hockey coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and puck around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the ice!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the ice you'd like (or leave it at a full-ice display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the ice at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" letters OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in March of 2009, it is one of the original applications of its kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  
Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Hockey WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Hockey WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the ice (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the ice surface (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the ice, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Hockey WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Hockey WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the ice? Use Hockey WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

- Drawing shows up everywhere instantly. Never any conflicts.

Design your website on your iPad, and then look up to see the same design on your Mac. It’s perfect. You glance at your second monitor and start coding. But this button should be here, not there. No worries, you select it on your iPad, and watch as the position updates in realtime on both screens.

- Collaborate with others over the internet, or P2P. Sync between devices when offline.

Create a board with your friend before going out into nature. Work on your sketches alongside each other, and watch them sync even without an internet connection. Their art is almost as beautiful as they are.

- AirPlay full document to Apple TV and Mac Client. Edit smaller parts on iPad.

Start a whiteboard for your team’s brainstorming, and see their pen strokes in milliseconds, even from across the globe. Airplay to the Apple TV in the boardroom to get the big picture. Everyone works on their part of the plan, and the boss marks up what she thinks could be better. It’s coming together perfectly.

- Data is fully encrypted in transit. Documents are stored on Apple’s servers only. No account necessary.

The data for your secret plans or corporate takeover is safe on Apple’s servers, and is only sent, encrypted, over the net while you’re actively drawing.

No document conflicts. No outside accounts. A simple interface. Whiteboarding joy."

- Drawing shows up everywhere instantly. Never any conflicts.

Design your website on your iPad, and then look up to see the same design on your Mac. It’s perfect. You glance at your second monitor and start coding. But this button should be here, not there. No worries, you select it on your iPad, and watch as the position updates in realtime on both screens.

- Collaborate with others over the internet, or P2P. Sync between devices when offline.

Create a board with your friend before going out into nature. Work on your sketches alongside each other, and watch them sync even without an internet connection. Their art is almost as beautiful as they are.

- AirPlay full document to Apple TV (from iOS app) and Mac Client. Edit smaller parts on iPad.

Start a whiteboard for your team’s brainstorming, and see their pen strokes in milliseconds, even from across the globe. Airplay to the Apple TV in the boardroom to get the big picture. Everyone works on their part of the plan, and the boss marks up what she thinks could be better. It’s coming together perfectly.

- Data is fully encrypted in transit. Documents are stored on Apple’s servers only. No account necessary.

The data for your secret plans or corporate takeover is safe on Apple’s servers, and is only sent, encrypted, over the net while you’re actively drawing.

No document conflicts. No outside accounts. A simple interface. Whiteboarding joy."

LIKE REAL NOTES, ONLY BETTER

Nothing beats a whiteboard and sticky-notes for capturing lots of loose information and seeing the big picture. Stickyboard 2 takes that flexibility and adds the convenience and power of your iPad. Don't worry about losing notes after a meeting again. It's much easier to carry around, and a lot friendlier for the environment.

NEATLY ARRANGE NOTES WITH A FLICK OF YOUR FINGERS

The most exciting feature of Stickyboard 2 is something we call Magic Arrange. One of the biggest pains of working with lots of sticky notes is having to arrange and rearrange them. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just wave your hands and have them neatly arrange themselves? Well, with the magic of the iPad and Stickyboard 2, now you can!

Just select a bunch of notes, then swipe with 3 fingers to instantly arrange them into neat piles, or fan them out into a grid, columns, or rows.

Try it out for yourself.

"412443803";"Doceri Interactive Whiteboard";"Combining screencasting, desktop control, and an interactive whiteboard in one app, you’ll never have to turn your back to the class or audience again. Create a lesson or presentation, insert images, save and edit your project and record a screencast video you can easily save or share. Doceri does it all!

Control your lesson or presentation live with Airplay or through your Mac or PC. Annotate a Keynote or PowerPoint, or present your original Doceri project. Great for student projects, too.

CREATE hand-written or hand-drawn Doceri projects on your iPad, using sophisticated drawing tools and the innovative Doceri Timeline. Unlike other drawing and screencast apps, Doceri uses timeline-based editing so original lessons are always saved, even after a screencast recording is created. All drawing strokes, photos or hand-drawn objects can be cut, pasted or resized at any point in the timeline. This enables easy creation and reuse of engaging presentations and high-quality, flipped classroom screencasts. 

CONTROL a computer through your iPad. When connected wirelessly to a classroom computer via our Doceri Desktop software, you can access and control any program or file on your desktop. Access all of your pedagogical materials through your tablet – even play flash video through your iPad. Download Doceri Desktop software at www.Doceri.com. You can also control your classroom AV system from the iPad with SP Controls’ AV Control Systems. 

PRESENT anything from your Mac or PC connected to a projector, using Doceri Desktop software. Present without a computer through Doceri’s special support for Apple TV. Your audience sees only the presentation area of your Doceri screen - not the tool bars or rotations.  

SHARE images, PDFs and videos any way you’d like. Rather than requiring login to a proprietary web site, Doceri lessons can be saved to your Camera Roll or shared via other apps you have installed on your iPad, so you can upload to your Web site, LMS or other platform of your choice. Share your images and video screencasts directly to YouTube, Twitter or Facebook from within the app. 

TRY BEFORE YOU BUY with this fully-featured free app. We’ve created Doceri  with a watermark that will be added to the images, PDFs and screencast videos that you share. You can remove or customize this watermark with an in app purchase - we believe that you should be able to try all of Doceri's features before you decide to purchase and support our work via the watermark removal.

What Teachers are saying About Doceri

Doceri has consistently received an average of 4½ stars on the iTunes App Store. 94% of Doceri teachers surveyed in May 2013 saw an improvement in classroom management since beginning to use Doceri, because they can teach while moving around among their students to keep them on task.

“Doceri allows me to present a lesson from anywhere in the classroom; a big plus when trying to manage 32+ middle school students. To actually see what I am writing and replay it while facing my students with my back to the board is amazing! I can work out equations ahead of time, or live in front of the students.”
- Anne Whitman, 7th grade math teacher at Oakdale Jr. High in California

“I love that I am not stuck behind my computer to use my computer. With Doceri, I can teach and circulate to help with classroom management. The students like that they can write on the screen from their desks. They also like that I can sit or stand by them and still teach and write on the screen.”
- Kristine Marsden, Ocoee Middle School in Ocoee, Florida"

"548963674";"Lacrosse WhiteBoard";"Now, updated for 64-bit systems and iOS 7 and newer!

Lacrosse WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase lacrosse coach's white board. It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field! You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display). Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number. You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the player's name) underneath the circle. Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall. You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards. Based on Soccer WhiteBoard which was originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of it's kind! It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years! Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Lacrosse WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback. 

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board. By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen. To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette. iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Lacrosse WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Lacrosse WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud! Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices. The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision. Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported. 

Lacrosse WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Lacrosse WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

Canvas Dx harnesses clinically validated artificial intelligence (AI) technology to aid physicians in diagnosing ASD in children between the ages 18-72 months who are at risk of developmental delay.

Canvas Dx incorporates 3 separate, user-friendly inputs:

1. A parent/caregiver questionnaire that asks about the child’s behavior and development collected via a parent/caregiver facing app

2. A questionnaire completed by video analysts who review two videos of the child recorded by the parents/caregivers

3. An HCP questionnaire completed by a physician who meets with the child and a parent/caregiver, collected via a healthcare provider portal

The Canvas Dx algorithm evaluates all 3 inputs, generating a device output for the prescribing physician to utilize in combination with their clinical judgement.

Canvas Dx is not intended for use as a stand-alone diagnostic device but as an adjunct to the diagnostic process.

Canvas Dx is for prescription use only.

CONTACT: 
Email: connect@cognoa.com
Phone: 1.866.4COGNOA (1.866.426.4662)

Indications for Use

Canvas Dx is intended for use by healthcare providers as an aid in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for patients ages 18 months through 72 months who are at risk for developmental delay based on concerns of a parent, caregiver, or healthcare provider. 

The device is not intended for use as a stand-alone diagnostic device but as an adjunct to the diagnostic process. The device is for prescription use only (Rx only).

Contraindications

There are no contraindications to using Canvas Dx.

Precautions, Warnings

The Device is intended for use by healthcare professionals trained and qualified to interpret the results of a behavioral assessment examination and to diagnose ASD.

The Device is intended for use in conjunction with patient history, clinical observations, and other clinical evidence the HCP determines are necessary before making clinical decisions. For instance, additional standardized testing may be sought to confirm the Device output, especially when the Device result is not Positive or Negative for ASD. 

Canvas Dx is intended for patients with caregivers who have functional English capability (8th grade reading level or above) and have access to a compatible smartphone with an internet connection in the home environment.

The Device may give unreliable results if used in patients with other conditions that would have excluded them from the clinical study. 

Among those conditions are the following:
• Suspected auditory or visual hallucinations or with prior diagnosis of childhood onset schizophrenia
• Known deafness or blindness
• Known physical impairment affecting their ability to use their hands
• Major dysmorphic features or prenatal exposure to teratogens such as fetal alcohol syndrome
• History or diagnosis of genetic conditions (such as Rett syndrome or Fragile X)
• Microcephaly
• History or prior diagnosis of epilepsy or seizures
• History of or suspected neglect
• History of brain defect injury or insult requiring interventions such as surgery or chronic medication

The Device evaluation should be completed within 60 days of the time it is prescribed because neurodevelopmental milestones change rapidly in the indicated age group."

I made this app as a prototype for a larger app I was working on, to my delight my kids LOVED it. They use this whenever they want to draw instead of the other drawing apps we already had.

I think they love it so much because there's no extra stuff to get in the way, they can just be totally immersed in drawing.

So I decided to release it to the App Store and let others try it out too. I appreciate your support.

Features:
* Draw anything you want with the colors of the rainbow.
* Draw together with friends and family using the Messages app. Just send a drawing to a friend and they can open it and draw on it too and then send it back.
* 6 convenient preconfigured marker sizes
* Undo, Redo, and Clear drawing actions
* Special ""Rainbow"" marker lets you draw with a rainbow!!! you gotta try it!
* Change the background color by long pressing on one of the colors

* Import photos to trace, annotate, and have fun with
* Shake to erase
* Save your drawings to your Photos library
* Print your drawings to AirPrint enabled printers
* Share your drawings with Messages, Mail, and many more
* Tip Jar allows you to provide financial support to further development of Whiteboard.

Whiteboard Labs Features (early stage features you can opt-in to try)

* Screen Recording - record the screen and audio as you draw, save or send the recording to friends and family.
* Infinite Canvas - add more pages to your canvas as you draw
* Draw with Motion - tilt your device to draw a picture

My goal is to make the funnest and easiest to use drawing app for kids. I improve Whiteboard with your reviews, feedback, and financial support. If you or someone you know, enjoys using Whiteboard:

"1266088066";"Scribble Together Whiteboard";"Draw to­geth­er in real time, from any­where! In seconds, any­one can follow along with your drawing or draw with you from the app or on the web. Use Scrib­ble along­side a call; talk with Face­Time or any other app you like.

DRAW ON ANY­THING
Draw over pdfs and im­ages. Snap a pic­ture of home­work and draw on it, or re­view a pdf to­geth­er. Once you are fin­ished, you can save out a new pdf with your an­no­ta­tions.

WEB OR APP
Work with any­one, even your guests who don’t have an iPad or iPhone. The web app can be used to draw us­ing a tablet, touch screen com­put­er, or sty­lus. Display your live drawing on a big screen in a classroom or conference room using any browser and a convenient link.

SET UP IN A SNAP
Get­ on the same white­board to­geth­er in seconds. No reg­is­ter­ing for an ac­count or adding con­tacts in yet an­oth­er app. Once you’ve con­nect­ed in Face­Time or by phone you can tell your guests to join you using a link or a code, for free, with no messy sign ups.

IN­FI­NITE SPACE, UN­LIM­IT­ED BOARDS
Control scrolling of the infinite drawing space so that everyone sees the same area at the same time. Whiteboards are unlimited, so you can start fresh for each topic. Unlike a real whiteboard, many people can draw in the same space at the same time!

POINT AND GES­TURE
Point­ things out as you’re speaking with Scribble’s vir­tu­al laser point­er. No more clumsy describing of which part of a pic­ture you're re­fer­ring to – just use the mag­i­cal dis­ap­pear­ing laser ink. Designate different colors if you and your guests both need to point.

PEN­CIL SUP­PORT
If you’ve got an iPad Pro and Apple Pen­cil, drawing feels especially great in Scrib­ble. It’s like us­ing pa­per, but you can draw with any­one, any­where in the world. You can also use Settings to decide what you’d like your finger to do while you have the Pencil in hand. 

NEAT SHAPES, STRAIGHT LINES
Can’t draw in a straight line? Neither can we! Scribble helps you draw perfect lines and shapes. Draw and pause without lifting your marker: you’ll see your shape pop magically into a rectangle, circle, ellipse, parallelogram, trapezoid, triangle or straight line. 

FREE FOR GUESTS
Invit­ing peo­ple re­quires Scribble membership, but your guests join you for free. The membership subscription comes free for 2 weeks per monthly subscription, or 1 month per annual subscription. Drawing on your own is also free, and you can keep your whiteboards if you decide you don’t want to invite others anymore.

Pay­ment will be charged to your iTunes ac­count at con­fir­ma­tion of pur­chase. The sub­scrip­tion auto-re­news at the same price un­less dis­abled in iTunes Ac­count Set­tings 24 hours be­fore the end of the pe­ri­od each month. You can go to scribble.cool/cancel for instructions to cancel your subscription and turn auto-renew off.

THE BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS REIMAGINED FOR MOBILE:

The Business Model Canvas is becoming a de facto standard for  brainstorming new business ideas. But, once you need to start validating them,  a large canvas on paper isn’t the most practical  tool to carry with you. Also, there is no clear path to go from a Business Model to a Financial plan.

So, we adapted it to fit mobile devices and added new layers to help you go beyond design:

> Financials: For helping you access your business model viability.

> Goals: For keeping track of your ambitions.

> Next Steps: For tracking what you need to do to reach your goals

The app provides a practical way to organize your goals and tasks in each business model block. This will help you to keep focus on specific areas when working on a task or experiment. Also, it will be easier to see which parts of your business you are moving forward and what it's being left behind.  

DESIGN A BETTER BUSINESS MODEL:

Add your ""sticky notes"" to the business model canvas and benefit from automatic charts that will provide better visuals for showcasing your business ideas to others.

EVALUATE KEY METRICS:

The built-in Customer Lifetime Value Simulator helps to understand the value of your customers and how much you can spend on customer acquisition to be sustainable. 

You can also generate Profit & Loss projections painlessly from you business model data to make a long term analysis of your margins.

GET READY FOR ACTION:

Achieve you most Important goals with the powerful OKR - Objectives and Key Results methodology, used by fast growing startups and companies.

"317282434";"Baseball WhiteBoard";"Now updated for 64-bit devices and iOS7 (and newer)!

Baseball WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase baseball coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of its kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Baseball WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Baseball WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Baseball WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Baseball WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Baseball WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

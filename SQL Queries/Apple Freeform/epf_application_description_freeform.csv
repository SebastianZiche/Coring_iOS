STEMboard gives educators the opportunity to build students’ mastery of prerequisite skills and close learning gaps they are demonstrating prior to a lesson. The STEMboard app is available for the cell phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop. With STEMboard, support student learning from the comfort of your couch, on the beach, or on your train ride home.

STEMboard is one of very few apps integrated with Google, allowing teachers to easily access their classes through Google classroom and upload assignments with a simple click. Students have the opportunity to practice prerequisite skills by completing assignments provided by their teachers, outside of the classroom. Utilizing our easy-to-use whiteboard, students show detailed work on their assignments from their phones, tablets, or desktops, and submit completed assignments to their teachers for corrections. Teachers then provide detailed feedback on student work to correct their assignments and support their learning. 

STEMboard features

• Assignment upload - Create assignments that will support student learning before they enter the classroom and easily upload from Google Drive, a cell phone, or personal PC to Google Classroom.  
• Whiteboard - Students use their finger, stylus, or text tools to complete and submit assignments on the whiteboard. Teachers receive the assignments and provide detailed feedback on student work, by directly marking up student work with corrections and next steps for improvement. Students access and implement the feedback to make changes to and correct their assignment.  
• Replay - Teachers are able to do and undo student work to see the order in which students wrote on the assignment, giving teachers a play-by-play of the process students used to complete each problem. Teachers can see students’ work from step 1 and students can see the exact process teachers used to correct their work and accurately complete each problem.
• Digital Folder - Students and teachers FOREVER have access to student work stored in the STEMboard app!

Help your students grow inside and outside the classroom with STEMboard."

Simply setup as many iOS devices from various vantage points for an event as you’d like…our platform will record and upload to the cloud WHILE RECORDING, syncing all views automatically, and making the video available for streaming. 

MULTI-VIEW RECORDING
Just set the game/event name, then join as many recording devices as you’d like. SnipBack AI will take care of the rest. When watching recorded footage, you’ll easily be able to switch vantage points as all views are automatically synced. 

TEAM SHARING
Associate a game/event with a team (or group), and then once uploaded, all team members will automatically have that game ready for streaming in their accounts. 

PINNED WHITEBOARDS 
Coaches, directors, or event organizers can easily record and pin a whiteboard session to a game/event. Just start a session, then speak, draw, and navigate through the video. Once done just stop the session, and then all team members will automatically see that pinned whiteboard in their accounts. Takes on demand learning to the next level. 

REAL-TIME BOOKMARKS
Coaches, directors, and event organizers can easily set digital bookmarks real-time, either from a recording device or from any mobile phones. Simple tap the bookmark button, and then when playing the video easily jump to and review bookmarked footage. If recording via multiple devices, these bookmarks automatically synced across all vantage points. 

ADVANCED STREAMING PLATFORM
All recordings are uploaded while recording (not afterwards), and as such footage is available to stream almost immediately (within 60 seconds).

BASKETBALL AI AND CV FEATURES
Utilize AI and CV for basketball, where all basketball footage is processed and made searchable. Users can easily create and view custom SnipReels, which are virtual videos broken down into play blocks. These blocks can be generated automatically by AI/CV or manually by coaches. Examples of some AI/CV blocks would be made shots, missed shots, made 3-pointers, assists, and turnovers just to name a few. Users scan share, link, or export any such block; they can even pin a custom whiteboard to a block. 

AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION 
Never before has it been so simple and secure for event participants to tap into any setup event cameras to get desired photos and videos for themselves. Once logged into an event with a special event code, they can simply tap their own bookmark button each time something they want footage for occurs (e.g. their kid just made a nice play). After that the desired footage from all vantage points automatically gets downloaded into their gallery….it’s that simple!

The Power of the SnipBack Recorder!

Introducing our exclusive patent pending SnipBack feature, which integrates DVR-like functionality within the record button. Just like with DVR’s, SnipBack allows you to go back in time to see what you’ve missed, and include that past video in your final clip!

"964565026";"Shoot Pro Webcam & Telestrator";"Shoot gives you a rock-solid connection to your iOS device’s camera for meetings and live streams. It's easy to connect and you get full manual camera controls when you need them. With Shoot's telestrator you can draw and add text (using your voice) on top of your video feed to quickly illustrate a point on-camera, or annotate whatever your camera is pointed at. You can pause the video to make this easier.

Connect to your computer over USB*, HDMI or AirPlay and stream live from Ecamm, OBS, Zoom or other streaming or meeting apps, for a professional-looking live stream.

Shoot is used thousands of times every month for everything from live music, DJ sets, podcasts, gaming and webinars, to church services, in classrooms, for sports, art, crafting, and even bingo, magic shows, puppet shows and drag shows.

WHY IS SHOOT’S CONNECTION SO RELIABLE?
Streaming high-definition video is a resource-intensive activity and apps that don’t use native Screen Mirroring have the odds stacked against them.

This is why apps that create their own USB connection to an OBS plugin, or broadcast over NDI are inherently prone to instability, high latency, freezes, crashes, lost connections and other random problems.

"1069141657";"Pastel Planner";"Annie gets up in the morning and looks at her phone. Before even catching up on Facebook, she runs up Pastel Planner to see what the day has in store for her. First thing she sees is a quote saying  “Never lose your sense of wonder"", and a list of the upcoming school events. Maths lesson, English, oh no some Physics homework is due today! Oh phew, the progress carrot tells her that she is 95% done - that can be finished on the bus.
 
Once at school, Annie checks Pastel Planner and sees that Maths is next, in room B12. She goes to B12, and listens intently to the teacher. At the end of the lesson, Ms Calculus says “your homework for next week is to solve these equations here”, pointing at the whiteboard. On the way out, Annie adds a new Homework task in Pastel Planner, points her phone at the white board and takes a photo. This automatically gets linked to the homework task. As she walks to her next lesson she adds some notes to the home work as a reminder, and sets the due date.
 
At the next break, her friend Chloe says “Hmm…no details on sports this afternoon, I wonder what is happening”. Annie says “Let me check”, flashes up Pastel Planner and select the school website’s Notices page, scrolls down and says “Awesome! Ma’a Nonu is coming in to coach us!”."

With Limnu, you can draw, plan, and think at the same time with other people. Make as many boards as you want, as big as you want, see your boards from anywhere, and all your work is automatically archived. Never again will you have to write ""DO NOT ERASE"" on your whiteboard. Its as fast and simple as a real whiteboard, and it even looks like a real whiteboard."
"576215025";"Fraction Wall";"Little Monkey Apps Fraction wall is designed for students to use in a small group or independent learning. It can be used to enhance use of using paper (or laminated) poster style fraction walls or Cuisenaire rods. The app can be used to answer traditional pen and paper style questions and caters to visual and kinesthetic learners as well as individual and partner games.

Little Monkey Apps never want to replace tried and true pedagogy. Hands on activities should never be replaced by virtual activities... but once you have constructed a fraction wall using paper strips or cuisinaire rods and are tired of picking up rods, or want to present the problem in a different manner, use Little Monkey Apps fraction wall!  

=Teacher Tool=
The teacher module is designed for use with a teacher, tutor or partner or for independent use to answer equivalent fraction problems. There are no right or wrong answers here only teachable moments and discoveries! Utilise the slide ruler across the bottom. When a ruler is positioned carefully, the app will display the equivalent fractions across the top of the wall. We say careful because 6/7ths is almost the same as 13/15ths... but its not! What a great classroom discussion could ensue!

Students can click on each 'brick' of the fraction wall to shade bricks, allowing the wall to be used for addition and subtractions of fractions, or to demonstrate equivalent bricks.  

This section contains a camera tool for students to take a screen shot and send to photo gallery or email which is useful for Portfolios 

The settings section also allows show or hide of fractions from halves up to fifteenths (thirteenths aren't very useful are they?)


=Complete the Wall=

The student is presented with an unshaded (blank) fraction wall with divisions marked. The forklift delivers the fraction pieces in a box. Click on the brick pile to get a fraction 'piece' or brick to build the wall. Students place the brick in the corresponding position. Students can place an equivalent fraction for example one quarter can take the place of two eighth bricks. 

-Level 1 halves and quarters
-Level 2 halves, thirds, quarters and sixths
-Level 3 halves, thirds, quarters fifths, sixths, tenths
-Level 4, halves up to tenths


=Two player game=
Turning the fraction wall into a game is something easily done by printing off a couple of copies of an unshaded fraction wall and labelling a die with the correct fractions... but guess what, we've put it in an App! No die to locate or not enough printed (I used to laminate mine and not have enough whiteboard markers!) 


The aim of this game is to fill your wall before your partner. The “show me” bar flips face the 'current' player. The player then taps the bricks to match, then presses answer. Students can place the pieces on equivalent fractions. If a player answers incorrectly, then the bricks just placed disappear and it is the other player's turn. 



=Addition=
Students are given a blank wall and given an addition problem. They can use the wall to assist, or they can simply answer the multiple choice problem. 
-Level 1 halves and quarters
-Level 2 halves, thirds, quarters and sixths
-Level 3 halves, thirds, quarters fifths, sixths, tenths
-Level 4, halves up to tenths"

"311715910";"Basketball WhiteBoard";"Now updated for iOS 7 and 64-bit support!

Basketball WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase basketball coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the court!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the court you'd like (or leave it at a full-court display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the ice at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" letters OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in the summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of its kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  
Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Basketball WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Basketball WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the court (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the court (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the court, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Basketball WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Basketball WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the court? Use Basketball WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

"583546023";"4 Dice a Fractions Game";"Multiplayer Fraction Game! Use two devices and play competitively or cooperatively with your classmates or parents.

4 Dice: Fraction Games hones the many concepts of fractions that include adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing through a series of game mode options. The game also enhances analytical thinking by providing the answer and requiring students to determine the appropriate equation. 

KEY FEATURES:
- Multiplayer Math Game!
- High order thinking game to challenge students in a fun way
- A built-in whiteboard to give students a place to work through problems

4 Dice: Fraction Games is a math app for middle school and upper elementary students. 

Common Core Mathematical Standard
4.NF Extend understanding of fractional equivalence and ordering.
5.NF Use equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions.
6 NF Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to divide fractions by fractions.

""This is a fantastic app for 4th grade students and up. It reviews the procedures for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions in the instructions and gives the users challenges. The best part is probably the ability for users to challenge their friends and connect using different devices close by!"" - 
Challenging App by M.L.I.S - Version 1.4 - Apr 14, 2013

Many classrooms don't have the resources for every student to have an iPad. Fortunately, there are ways to solve this problem and still get the most out of the 4 Dice game.

1. One Device with Multiple Players

This is usually a situation where there is one device, which is probably owned by the teacher. Write the problem out on the board. Have each student get out a piece of paper and a pencil or use the printable version of the game. Set a time limit - one minute is recommended - to have each student try to solve the problem on the board.

2. A Few Devices with Multiple Players

This is usually a situation where there are a few devices, but not enough for everyone to have their own. Let students work in small groups with one device. A blank piece of paper or the printable board can be used to record work. To do this:

    Create a multiplayer username (ex. Group 1)
    Use the numbers rolled on the device and solve the problem
    Input the information from the answer into the device to check it

3. Multiple Devices with Multiple Players

If there are enough devices for everyone, there are four basic options: let students work individually, break students into small groups of two or three, split off into groups of two and compete as partners, or play as a classroom."

Works not only with documents, receipts, business cards, notebooks, catalogs and other paper-based media, but also with the likes of whiteboards, posters, and train schedules. Use this application to obtain high-quality images.

Upon importing images contained in your iPhone's Photo Album or those taken with your device's camera, this application automatically recognizes the frame (outline) in the pictures, renders them so that they appear to be viewed from the front, and even enhances their attractiveness through applying color correction. This enables a level of image quality reminiscent of something taken with a scanner.

* Price may change without prior notice.

?Features?

The following represent a sample of the features offered by this application.

Additionally, the application captures multiple candidate frames, thereby offering enhanced work efficiency relative to cases in which only one frame can be obtained.

(2) Front-facing adjustment
Photos taken at a diagonal are adjusted to make them appear to have been taken from the front. Distortion correction can also be carried out using the degree of distortion obtained through the frame recognition feature mentioned in (1) above.

(3) Color correction
This feature enables fine images to be taken in color as well as in black-and-white. Images are processed to ensure that even small characters are vividly reproduced. Furthermore, should shadows be present in the background of a photo, the application uses a background color modification function to eliminate only the shadows while preserving any characters or graphics.

?Main Functions?

-Function that takes multiple continuous shots and chooses the sharpest image (BSS:Best-Shot Selection function)
-“Takes photo when shaking stops” function

SnapSuite is an all-in-one construction management solution, which allows field service companies to easily dispatch technicians, manage projects and generate quotes in half the time.

Designed for construction and skilled trade industries, SnapSuite enables contractors to improve scheduling, manage project costs, and eliminate the stress of handling paperwork. It helps companies schedule and administer business management systems, increasing overall efficiency. 

SnapSuite comes with a scheduling system for real field workers and tools to track project costs. Additionally, it allows users to send invoices and get paid faster through an integration with QuickBooks application.

Many small business owners manually keep track of projects as well as clients by using whiteboards, Excel spreadsheets, and emails or several disconnected tools. Sales staff use Word files for quotation templates, crunch the numbers in Excel, send everything to the client and use calendars for follow-ups. After client’s agreement to quotes, the service or project managers track tasks manually, gather reports and pictures, print hard copies and transfer digital copies to customers’ files.

SnapSuite helps eliminate manual steps from day-to-day operations and streamline the entire lifecycle through automation. Additionally, it allows business owners to easily analyze real-time reports, ensuring smarter decisions and overall business growth."

With one simple philosophy - everything you need and nothing more - this app helps you with day-to-day running of the class. Take the register, track progress, record comments, set homework, all from a few simple screens.

FOCUSED ON EASE OF USE
You probably have an MIS or other system for tracking students formally. Those systems are often slow and cumbersome. Working Class keeps things simple so you can use it quickly and easily during a class; it won't slow you down or distract you from your primary focus, your students.

TEACHER-DESIGNED
Designed by a teacher so we know what's important. We use this in the classroom so we want it to work and we want it to work well. If something is awkward or slow, we care about improving it because we need our app to get out of our way.

HOMEWORK
Set homework in the app then either type details or take a photo of your whiteboard. You can then choose to email the task to your students and set yourself a reminder for the due date. Once complete, you can send individual emails to the students with their scores.

REPORTING
Keeping track of students is important so I have included a basic markbook for tracking progress, along with a chart to see how students are doing compared to their target.

COMPUTER FRIENDLY
Import data from your computer to help populate the classes quickly. Chances are an exported class from your MIS will be read straight away. Folders of images can also be sent to the app to provide photos, simply name each file with student's code. And marksheets can be exported for completion on a computer then sent back to Working Class to update.

NO TRACKING
With no adverts or other services, you can rest assured that data about your students is never uploaded; information only leaves your phone if you choose to export it.

"403214226";"Field Hockey WhiteBoard";"Now built for 64-bit devices and iOS 7 (and newer)!

Field Hockey WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase field hockey coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Based on Hockey WhiteBoard (originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009),  it is one of the original applications of it's kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Field Hockey WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Field Hockey WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Field Hockey WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Field Hockey WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Field Hockey WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

Whole photo, Documents, posters, arts such as paintings and calligraphy, exhibits, screens, blackboards, whiteboards, signs, screens, timetables, etc.
You may want to leave a photo as a memo by taking photos with your smartphone camera or tablet camera.
The problem is that the image of the picture is distorted by the influence of the camera lens.

Even if the subject is at a right angle, it will not be a right angle photo.
If the subject is rectangular, it will be a quadrangle with perspective.

You can convert such perspective distorted quadrangle to the original subject rectangle.

Cut out a free-form quadrangle from the photo and convert it to a rectangle.
The cropping quadrangle does not have to be a right angle, and it is OK to use a trapezoid, a rhombus, a parallelogram, or a freeform quadrangle.

If you can not shoot the subject directly in front of you, the photos will have perspective.
To be precise, even if taken straight ahead, some distortion is inevitable.

However, with this app, even photos taken from an oblique direction can be converted to rectangular images viewed from the front.

You can edit the position of the corner mark for clipping while checking the clipping image on the preview screen in real time.

"1606002181";"""Talking About"" Series";"Children and young people are required to respond to a wide range of challenging social situations that occur in their daily lives. Successful management of these situations is dependent on the young person’s social skills, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal problem-solving capacity, as well as the response of others and the context of the event. Many children and young people can find management of everyday situations difficult, particularly if they are on the autistic spectrum or have a learning difficulty.

Black Sheep Press 'Talking About' App gives children the opportunity to discuss with a relevant adult, common situations and difficulties they may face.

Topics are suitable for a wide age range (4 -11+ years). Purchase each topic as you need it or buy multiple topics for the age group you are working with.

Each topic shows different scenarios. Response pictures illustrate ways of behaving which will encourage discussion about the ‘right’ thing to do and prompt children and young people to make their own suggestions.

For children or young people who have not learnt to read or who have reading difficulties, there is optional audio. The background to the text can also be changed to yellow which may help some children read the text.

The app can record the child’s responses and discussions. This makes it ideal for role play and ‘rehearsal’ of social conversations. The adult using the app can make notes and email these together with the recordings.

The app is perfect for one-to one or small group work. By linking the device to a whiteboard the app can be used for whole class work.

The app covers a range of topics:

Talking About Classroom Behaviour: depicts challenging classroom behaviour and communication breakdown and suggests alternative ways of dealing with them. Aimed at a primary school age group, it includes many real life situations encountered in classrooms  - for example taking turns, feeling anxious and playing together.

Talking About Friends: concerns relationships with friends. Scenarios include feeling left out, negotiation, saying sorry, bullying (4 years. – 7 years.)

Talking About School: depicts a range of challenging social and educational situations for the younger, or less mature, age group (4 years. – 7 years). Scenarios include a child who has no-one to play with; older children ask a child to do something 'naughty'.

Talking About Social and Emotional Skills: challenging scenarios, leading to a variety of positive and negative emotions and/or personal qualities such as jealousy, loneliness, ambition and courage. Prompt questions to be used by teaching staff or speech and language therapists are included. Suitable for developmental age 11-13 years.

Talking About Conversation: designed to develop social skills, verbal reasoning skills, situational understanding & inferencing skills in children (11 years. – 16 years). To help teach the skills required to be a good conversational partner, scenarios include identifying the appropriate moment to start a conversation, selecting appropriate topics for conversation, asking to join in.

Talking About Community: to help teach young people (ages 11 years. – 16 years.) social skills, specifically aimed at supporting the transfer of these skills into everyday settings in the local community. Scenarios are almost entirely based on the experiences and difficulties of a group of Year 9 students and include waiting in a queue, travelling on a bus and what to do in an emergency.

Talking About Secondary School: Designed for children who are about to move to Secondary School, or who have transferred and are struggling with the transition. Children discuss 14 large pictures which shows a situation relevant to their experiences at school. Each scenario has four associated pictures which provide appropriate – and some inappropriate -  solutions. For example, mixing with older children at the bus stop and forgetting your homework."

"1562815167";"Bärenstark! Training";"Die Bärenstark!-App bietet dir umfangreiche Funktionen rund um die moderne Trainingsplanung und deinem Trainingstagebuch.

Trainingsplanung 2.0
Stelle dir deinen kompletten Trainingsplan selbst zusammen - bestimme dein Ziel, die Anzahl deiner Trainingstage pro Woche und die Übungen, den Rest erledigen wir für dich. Unser Algorithmus berechnet dir dein optimales Trainingsgewicht und die Wiederholungsanzahl je nach Ziel - damit du es auch 100% erreichst.

Wähle aus verschiedenen Vorlagen und lasse dir deinen Trainingsplan zuschneiden. Anhand deiner Leistungen und gespeicherten Gewichte berechnen wir dir immer das perfekte Gewicht. 

Bei der Trainingsplan-Generierung werden alle 7 Trainingsprinzipien berücksichtigt:

1. Prinzip des trainingswirksamen Reizes
Wir berechnen die Satz- und Wiederholungszahl so, dass dein Training einen Reiz erzielt!

2. Prinzip der progressiven Belastungssteigerung
Wir erhöhen von Zeit zu Zeit die Intensität deines Trainingsplans, damit dein Training nicht stagniert.

3. Prinzip der variierenden Belastung
Durch eine Vielzahl an Übungen und Zielen kannst du dein Training abwechslungsreich gestalten. 

4. Optimale Relation zwischen Belastung und Regeneration
Die Trainingspläne sind so gestaltet, dass du auf deinem Trainingslevel ausreichend Regenerationszeit hast, damit deine Muskeln wachsen können.

5. Prinzip der Dauerhaftigkeit und Kontinuität
Jeder Trainingsplan dauert mindestens 6 Wochen. Durch das Trainingstagebuch bleibst du dran und wirst motiviert, deinen Trainingsplan einzuhalten.

6. Prinzip der Periodisierung und Zyklisierung
Zu jedem Ziel lässt sich ein anderer Trainingsplan generieren. Dadurch hast du immer den perfekten Trainingsplan für Muskelaufbau, Kraftaufbau und Kraftausdauer. 

7. Prinzip der Individualität und Altersgemäßheit
Wir geben kein Trainingsgewicht vor, ohne deine Leistung zu kennen. Solltest du noch kein Gewicht gespeichert haben, geben wir dir Prozentangaben und berechnen dir nach und nach dein optimales Gewicht.

Trainingstagebuch

Neben der Speicherung deines Trainingsplans ist es möglich, Workouts mit einem Foto und Text abzuspeichern. Hierfür kannst du formlos dein Training in ein Textfeld eintragen und musst keine Formulare ausfüllen oder in deinem Notizheft suchen. Das ist optimal für HIIT-Workouts, welche du in deinem Functional-Fitness-Studio an deinem Whiteboard findest.

* Automatische Texterkennung
Mach ein Foto deines Workouts auf dem Whiteboard - die App erkennt automatisch den Text und du kannst diesen in wenigen Sekunden abspeichern. So kannst du dich auf das Wichtige konzentrieren: das Training.

* Detaillierte Trainingsstatistiken
Bring dein Training auf das nächste Level, indem du dir deine Trainingsstatistiken ansiehst und so deine Planung verbesserst. Du kannst dein Trainingsvolumen, deine Maximalkraft und weitere Metriken ansehen und so deine Erfolge direkt sehen.

Highlights von Jetzt Bärenstark!:

Trainingsplanung:
* Erstelle dir deinen individuellen Trainingsplan - nutze eine Vorlage oder bestimme selber die Übungen.
* Lass dir das optimale Gewicht für dein Ziel anhand deiner bisherigen Leistungen berechnen und profitiere vom optimalen Trainingsreiz

Trainingstagebuch
* Tracke deine Workouts als Text oder Foto
* Speichere dein Körpergewicht und habe so immer deinen Fortschritt und dein Ziel vor Augen.

AnswerGarden Ad-free allows your classroom or conference audience to instantly connect to AnswerGardens shared via local WiFi networks and easily participate in an AnswerGarden-session without any distractions!

AnswerGarden is a social response app for classrooms, creatives and conferences. AnswerGarden allows you to pose a question or a topic for your audience to answer or comment on. The unique twist of AnswerGarden is that it cleverly combines the expression of the respondents’ own answers with a Twitter-like confinement of 20 characters and a representation in the form of a growing word cloud. The instant result provides an overview of all answers, ranked in popularity, which can then be used for further analysis or group discussion.

Since its launch users have found numerous applications for AnswerGarden. Creative designers use it for brainstorming while conference speakers employ AnswerGarden for breaking the ice with their audience. Educators use it with their students for formative assessments and therapists apply AnswerGarden to personal mind mapping exercises.

Please visit http://AnswerGarden.ch to start a new brainstorm.

AnswerGarden is made by Creative Heroes, a two-person design team in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

* Critical Acclaim *

""AnswerGarden is the answer to great polls and brainstorming"" - ICT For Educators

""When I first read about AnswerGarden on Twitter (...) I admit I was skeptical. It seemed as though it was almost too simplistic...but that's the beauty of it!"" - Teaching with Technology

""A kind of Wordle for responses"" - Tim Rylands, ludodidactic

""I recently came across a Web 2.0 tool that is new to me and I’m already hooked. (...) It appears to be a great tool for encouraging higher order thinking and building vocabulary because unlike Twitter that lets you type the exorbitant amount of 140 characters, AnswerGarden only allows you 20 characters."" - Discovery Education

""AnswerGarden – quick, simple brainstorming""- Whiteboardblog.co.uk

""With AnswerGarden, creative brainstorming and collecting feedback has never been easier! In addition to surveys and polls, this ""cool tool"" can be used to establish the knowledge level of a class regarding a certain concept. It also can be used as a fun and interactive assessment, icebreaker, parking lot and/or exit ticket."" - Edutech for Teachers

""AnswerGarden can also be embedded in your own blog,website, or a wiki. It is a very practical way for teachers to establish the knowledge level of a class on a certain subject."" - Educators Technology

""You don’t need to sign up to use it and creating an AnswerGarden literally takes seconds. (...) For short answers that are collected with absolute minimum fuss, AnswerGarden trumps anything else."" - Inquiry + elearning

""At first, I didn’t appreciate its depth so don’t be surprised that on the surface it looks quite drab. (...) The key piece is the collaboration (and) in its Twitter-like confinement to a limited number of characters. AnswerGarden’s is only 20 characters."" - Tuesdays with Karen

“Processing feedback manually can take an eternity. This takes care of the tricky bits.” - KillerStartups.com

""Answergarden is a great tool for canvassing your class for their ideas and understanding (...) for taking quick snapshots or for citizenship work."" - David Kinane, eLearning Innovator

""And the final verdict? AnswerGarden had the best export features – I loved the fact that it just worked seamlessly with Wordle."" - athrawes.com

""It's a nice way to see how the class as a whole feels about their knowledge and weaknesses."" - Matthew Gillispie, From Notepad to IPad

""AnswerGarden is a fun way for students to brainstorm, plan, and work together. (...) The possibilities are endless!"" - ilearntechnology.com

""AnswerGarden is an easy way to get feedback from the children. You could use this to get scientific predictions before an experiment."" - talkPrimaryICT"

"1435221449";"Birch - Organized Photo Notes";"Birch is a different kind of Notes app, built for photos. It's Notes, for visual individuals!

Organized photo notes:
Are you the type of person who's always super busy, and takes quick reminder photos of things you need to remember later? Is your photo album filled with pictures of product labels, mail, receipts, household projects, whiteboards, recipes, etc? Many of us have turned our photo album into a visual notes app, but Birch can make this ""Photo Notes"" part of your life much simpler and more organized! Just snap a photo, add a hashtag in a note, and that's it! Create photo notes in seconds and find them lighting fast when you need them later.

Hashtags are simpler and way more convenient than creating albums and folders to organize your photos, especially these reminder note photos! Think of it like a document scanner mixed with an organized file cabinet, except it's not limited to only documents or PDFs and can be used to document and reference anything that can be captured by a photo! Multiple hashtags can be added to any photo note, so you can find these organized pics in multiple places. And the organization is managed automatically for you by simply adding hashtags to your notes!

Just a few examples of where Birch really shines:
• Snapping a quick photo note of something you see in the wild and want to buy later.
• Labels & product numbers of household supplies you need to find at the store later.
• Receipts and mail you don't want to keep physical copies of.
• Organizing and saving whiteboard notes, so you can safely erase but never lose.
• Or even just organizing your favorite photos from an occasion (it's built for notes... but it's still way easier than managing personal photo albums)

Free with a paid Pro option:
I'm a small indie developer, but I don’t think it’s right to make money unless you’re actually getting value. So you get a good amount of features and functionality for free, then have an upgrade option to access more “power user” features. If Birch is helping to make your life a bit easier, upgrading costs less than 5 coffees per year… only 3 if you drink the good stuff!

Organize your life, with beautiful photo notes! A clean, simple and intuitive design that looks great in Light or Dark mode!




In-App purchase disclaimer:
Should you decide to upgrade to Birch Pro, a purchase will be applied to your iTunes account at the time of upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

"1514943618";"Turn Tracker";"Turn Tracker (the successor to the popular app InitiativeBoard) is a slick and easy to use initiative tracking aid for combat in pen-and-paper role playing games like D&D (5e or any other edition), Pathfinder (1e or 2e), Starfinder, Shadowrun and many other systems. Initiative rules are configurable to your game's rules: choose dice (d20, d10, 1d6 to 5d6), ascending/descending order, range of values and more. Also choose from one of the built-in color schemes, or design your own.

No more messy whiteboards, magnetic boards or pencil and paper! Quickly and easily create draggable tiles for PCs and NPCs, and arrange them in initiative order on the board, or let the app take over the dice-rolling for you.

Determining initiative, changing the turn order and starting new encounters is all a matter of seconds.

Turn Tracker fully supports landscape and portrait orientation as well as slide-over and multitasking - no more app switching just because you need to look something up in a PDF or on the web. 

The free version of Turn Tracker supports one campaign with up to 10 tiles on the board (5 PCs/NPCs each). Upgrading to Premium lifts these restrictions and you can run multiple campaigns in parallel, with unlimited PCs/NPCs per campaign."
"314066510";"Soccer WhiteBoard";"Now updated for iOS 7 and 64-bit support!

Soccer WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase soccer coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of it's kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Soccer WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Soccer WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Soccer WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Soccer WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Soccer WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

IMPRESSIVE STORY FROM USER
""When my family began trying to share old family letters in the 1980’s, photocopying was the best option. Later, saving scans to CD’s was considered, as was scanning on a printer’s flatbed. Then a few years ago I learned of AI Scan and have never looked back! AI Scan does an excellent job of scanning these many hundreds of letters quickly and efficiently—in any setting! Its portability (on my phone) is high on my list of recommendations. Over the few years I have used it, AI Scan has continued to improve its features and make scanning even more convenient. It has made my job of scanning and saving to Google Drive infinitely easier, and for that I much appreciate it.""

Spyware can be used to remotely activate your smartphone’s cameras and microphones to capture valuable information shared through conversations and visuals. Privoro’s SafeCase can help prevent your smartphone from becoming a spying device turned against you.

Key benefits:

• Reduce your overall risk exposure

• Rendering meaningless any captured audio means that information shared in free-ranging and unfiltered discussions, including information not available to hackers in any other format, can’t be exploited.



TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES

Rather than trusting your smartphone’s operating system or third-party security software to keep bad actors from accessing your cameras and microphones, you have physical control over these components.



GO WITH CONFIDENCE

Whether whiteboarding with a colleague or having a sensitive conversation with a family member, feel confident that you’re not inadvertently feeding valuable information to an adversary, that could, in turn, be used against you or your organization.



SAFECASE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL USE

SafeCase is a smartphone-coupled security device providing unprecedented defense against illicit camera and microphone usage while allowing full use of the phone. These features include:



AUDIO MASKING

To protect both the content and context of conversations, the SafeCase device employs random, independent sound transmissions to each of the smartphone’s microphones.



CAMERA BLOCKING

A physical barrier over each of the smartphone’s cameras prevents intruders from observing or recording any visual data in the device’s vicinity.



GOVERNANCE

In an organizational setting, administrators can define policies around camera and microphone exposure and set alerts and user notifications to ensure you’re maximizing SafeCase protections.



The Privoro App is the companion application that enables communication between SafeCase and the cloud. The app sends telemetry data and log information to Privoro’s cloud-based policy engine to ensure users remain in compliance with established policy around smartphone use across environments and situations.



PRIVORO APP FEATURES

• A dashboard for SafeCase status, including battery level and cloud connectivity.

• A tool to verify that your SafeCase’s audio masking feature is working as intended, providing peace of mind that conversations in the vicinity of your phone are safe from eavesdropping through your phone’s microphones.

• A help section that provides: Setup and use instructions, including, how to install and pair your phone with SafeCase, charging, adjusting settings, and troubleshooting.

• Tools and tips on utilizing and maximizing the use of SafeCase, including those steps that may be required by your organization to stay in compliance with set policies (e.g., Check in/Check out)



SafeCase is currently available for use with iPhone 7, 8, SE (2nd generation), and iPhone 12."

Brilliant!! ***** by Kasia_London - Version 1.3
I've been looking for an app like this. It's got a cursive font which is used in schools in the UK and offers a complete writing programme from the beginners until KS2. It's fantastic!!

excellent ***** by SusieMla - Version 1.0
The app is very impressive, comprehensive, and heavily customizable. I've found it to be a great tool for helping my child learn. I can only recommend it!

A must have for every parent and teacher ***** by mrsnic123 - Version 1.5
Students just love this app. They love the different colour choices and the replay button. Definitely seen positive results with students with fine motor difficulties. Congratulations on a great app.

Must-Have for all schools ***** by Aunty_Vegemite - Version 1.5
Brilliant App that is more than just a hand writing App. It can also be used in just about any curriculum area. Incredibly easy to make my own word lists with pictures and sounds. 

School Writing is a fully-customizable and feature-packed app that provides students with plenty of practice to perfect their writing of letters, words and numbers using their correct UK school font (and lines) on the iPad.

Students intuitively trace pre-handwriting shapes, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, words or whiteboard images that you import with the touch of a finger. Hear and see letters, words and numbers with customised associated images and sounds.

School Writing allows the teacher or parent to create lessons using written instructions, unique images and audio instructions, to which the student can respond using written and audio recordings. This 'open scaffold' enables the lessons to be words, numbers or symbols and extends the use of School Writing far beyond early education. Completed lessons can be automatically emailed to the teacher or parent with the student’s tracings and recordings included.

With tracing accuracy turned to infants, easy, medium or hard, the students are rewarded with a half or full star depending on their accuracy. They are given three attempts before automatically advancing to the next letter or number. The default teacher tracings or your customisations of the teacher tracings are used as the basis for checking the students tracing accuracy. This allows for complete flexibility over stroke direction for left hand writers. 

The ‘Whiteboard’ section allows a teacher to draw or import images, with unique audio instructions for tracing or interacting with. Students can trace and record audio answers. ‘Whiteboard’ is the pre handwriting activities.  Each student can have a unique profile.

"308950002";"Hockey WhiteBoard";"Now built for iOS 7 and later with 64-bit support!

Hockey WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and puck positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase hockey coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and puck around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the ice!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the ice you'd like (or leave it at a full-ice display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the ice at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" letters OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in March of 2009, it is one of the original applications of its kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  
Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Hockey WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Hockey WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the ice (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the ice surface (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the ice, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Hockey WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Hockey WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the ice? Use Hockey WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

"1477991808";"THINKERS App - Notes and Ideas";"The THINKERS App helps you do more with your best ideas through easier capture, better organization, and collaborative sharing. 

Combined with our THINKERS Notebook, this groundbreaking combo will help you unlock your creativity and ideas - from paper to the cloud. 

TESTIMONIALS

""I've looked around at a lot of different apps, and they all do the job of note-taking. But when you're talking about a system that captures and then helps you clarify your notes, I feel like this app might be the wave of the future."" -- Patrick G.

""I love the simplicity and flexibility of the app for capturing thoughts and ideas. The ability to simply tag, geotag, share, organize, and then re-locate things that are important to me in a meaningful and customizable way is awesome. I haven't found anything like it in any other application!"" -- Jeffrey K.

Let’s break down the key features ...

ONE-CLICK CAPTURE

Capture any type of idea the moment inspiration hits -- no keyboard required.

Just a tap allows you to capture a handwritten idea, an image, a document, an audio recording, a video recording, or even a whiteboard. And you’ll have searchable text and tags all without needing to type.

BETTER ORGANIZATION

You don’t need to fit your style to our app; the app conforms to you. Create your own intuitive folder structure using custom colors and images. 

And when you’re looking for that one particular note, search with confidence. Our powerful Smart Search feature will be able to identify your ideas and notes by searchable text and tags you didn’t even have to enter yourself.

HANDWRITING RECOGNITION

Our unique machine learning technology automatically recognizes handwriting so words on a notebook page or whiteboards can be searched in the app. Plus, audio and video notes are automatically transcribed so you can find what was said. 

INSTANT TAGGING

Tags are a great way to organize your ideas. And with our built-in ML, hashtags in your notebook are appended to your notes in the app, along with auto-tagging of images. Quickly connect your ideas using our built-in tagging system.

ONE-TAP SHARING

Share individual ideas or entire folders with just a tap. The best part? The person you’re sharing with can access your idea(s) from any device using our custom-built, web-based collaboration interface -- no THINKERS App account required.

And if they want to leave you a comment, it’s right there in the interface. Turn your notifications on and you’ll get notified when comments come in.

But that’s not all …

The THINKERS App also features all of the following:

** Widgets for your phone including Quick Capture, Recent Comments, and Last Note Taken.

** Secure cloud storage you can count on.

** Optional cloud sync with your favorite third-party provider (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) (Requires Subscription)

** Location awareness (once you enable) that appends location info to your notes.

** An interactive “My Nearby Notes” map so you can have a spatial view of your ideas.

SUBSCRIPTION OVERVIEW & TERMS

No subscription is required to capture pages from your THINKERS Notebook.

If you would like to unlock the advanced features of the app - including capturing photos, documents, audio/video, whiteboards, text, and advanced data sync - then you will need a subscription.

Start your subscription with a free 7-day trial. 

Once the trial is over, you’ll be charged a subscription fee based on the duration and price you select at the time of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Settings > iTunes Account & App Store > Apple ID > Subscriptions to manage your membership and turn auto-renew off. Your iTunes Account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed.

"1509098773";"Tutori! Write on shared docs";"Two people, working remotely, can now work on the same sheet of paper from anywhere, at the same time, and see what each other is writing as they work. 

Tutori! relieves the headaches with remote tutoring and recreates the in-person experience that is ideal for many subjects, like math and test prep. Fortunately, video conferencing applications such as FaceTime help to bridge the physical distance, but that only takes remote tutoring part of the way. In order for a truly interactive two-way experience, tutors and students need to be working together, on the same document, seeing what each other writes as it is written. Tutori! gives people, regardless of their location, the ability to work together in real time as if they were in-person with both sets of eyes and pens on the same sheet of paper.


START TODAY - NO ACCOUNT REQUIRED
Best of all, our perpetual free-trial let’s you start 2 sessions each and every month. Download Tutori! and start working now. No account, no login, and no commitment is needed. 

WORK ON DOCUMENTS 
Whiteboards are great for sharing ideas, but what if you have a worksheet, practice test, or a textbook? That’s why we built Tutori! It’s like a document-based whiteboard. You can import and share documents and photos, then work on them together, in real-time. We even include blank sheets and graph paper. You can choose your favorite pen and highlighter colors and work the way that makes sense to you. Print, email, or share your work as a PDF whenever you want.

UNLIMITED STUDY ROOMS
Each student has their own Study Room so you can keep your work with each student separate from the others. Study Rooms makes it easy to share documents and quickly see what you’ve already worked on. This also helps each student create their own digital notebooks of work as time goes on since there is no limit to the number of documents you can share.

DESIGNED FOR ONLINE TUTORING
Tutori! Is built for remote tutoring and is the perfect complement to working with someone via a video conference or on the phone. Set up the call, start a session and you can immediately see what each other writes, in real-time, as it happens. It’s like you’re sitting right there with them. And any work you do offline is automatically synchronized and shared when your next session starts. 

PENCIL SUPPORT
Writing in Tutori! with an Apple Pencil is like writing on real paper. It’s smooth and efficient, and you can easily switch between different colors and line widths. Don’t have an Apple Pencil? That’s OK, you can use your finger or stylus. 

YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT
You don’t need to log into an account or provide an email to use Tutori!. And we don’t keep copies of your documents on our servers. You and your business belong to you and we respect that. You can see our complete privacy policy at: https://www.tutori.io/privacy.html

"498416451";"School Writing - learn the abc";"An education created app that contains the education approved fonts for your school, including individual plain and cursive letters, used in the United States of America schools – Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian. Available on the Apple 50% Discount Education Volume Purchase Program.

Wonderful ***** by K Tchr
As a kindergarten teacher, and parent of a kindergarten and preschool child, I love this app! It teaches D'Nealian, which is an introduction to learning cursive. I love that there are thoroughly thought through lessons to break writing into chunks for students. Leaves that student in the exact place they left off, awards the student stars for job well done on each part of the lesson, and gives immediate feedback if a student needs improvement. Brought this to my Assistant Principal to use school wide.

A must have for every parent and teacher ***** by mrsnic123
Students just love this app. They love the different colour choices and the replay button. Definitely seen positive results with students with fine motor difficulties. Congratulations on a great app.

Must-Have for all schools ***** by Aunty_Vegemite
Brilliant App that is more than just a hand writing App. It can also be used in just about any curriculum area. Incredibly easy to make my own word lists with pictures and sounds.

Students intuitively trace pre-handwriting shapes, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, words or whiteboard images with the touch of a finger or using the Apple Pencil. Hear and see letters, words and numbers with optional customized associated images and sounds.

With tracing accuracy turned on to easy, medium or hard the students are rewarded with a half or full star depending on their accuracy. They are given three attempts before automatically advancing to the next letter or number. The default teacher tracings or your customisations of the teacher tracings are used as the basis for checking the students tracing accuracy. This allows for complete flexibility over stroke direction for left hand writers. Teacher tracing also offers the ability to record audio for letter sounds and tracing instructions.

School Writing allows the teacher or parent to create lessons, with written instructions, unique images and audio instructions, to which the student can respond using written and audio recordings. This 'open scaffold' enables the lessons to be words, numbers or symbols and extends the use of School Writing far beyond early education. Completed lessons can be automatically emailed to the teacher or parent with the student’s tracings and recordings included.

The ‘Whiteboard’ section allows a teacher to draw or import images, with unique audio instructions for tracing or interacting with. Students can trace and record audio answers. It is also the pre handwriting activities in conjunction with the EduColouring activity within the app.

Create, save and share your own ‘Word’ lessons, profiles and customisations to suit your curriculum, with complete control over the management of the lessons, the app and the student profiles. Full import and export functions are included for iPad classrooms including Airdrop file transfer, email, iTunes, dropbox or sending the lessons to the demografix website for public access.

Lock the app into a restricted student mode. In student mode, word lessons cannot be created or deleted and profiles cannot be changed. Students have no access to the app settings when a teacher PIN is set.
Each student can have a unique profile.

"1533113327";"MiHealTeam - Patient";"MiHealTeam: manage patient care from your smartphone as a patient. MiHealTeam app replaces the traditional whiteboard in a hospital setting, allows call bells to be sent to nursing staff from your smartphone, collects ratings/feedback from patients, and provides updates about patient care to healthcare staff and patients. 

MiHealTeam can be used as a way to communicate in the hospital without face to face interaction to inform patients and/or patient advocates about patients. Patients can use the app to send call bells to nurses, receive announcements from physicians, and share their status with advocates of their choice. MiHealTeam improves communication speed and consistency between healthcare staff and patients. Designed to raise the quality of the hospital patient’s experience by keeping them engaged in their care through the app. Patient engagement is achieved in the MiHealTeam app by giving documentation of vitals in real-time, ability to access their care plan, requesting assistance from nursing staff, viewing messages from physicians, an interactive discharge checklist, and prompts for daily hospital and staff ratings. The patient has the option to share viewing privileges with family, health care proxy, or friends by texting a link with an invite to create an advocate profile. Ratings are collected from patients on staff performance and the overall patient experience. MyHealTeam patient ratings are more granular and comprehensive than traditional HCAHPS scoring techniques.  

MiHealTeam replaces the traditional whiteboard. The healthcare professionals assigned to the patient are viewable in the “My Care Team” tile which is on the main dashboard of the app. In the “My Care Team” portion of the app, the patient's care team is shown with the staff members' name, title, and high-resolution photo. 

The medical updates from the healthcare team are logged in the patient app. Patient profiles can be easily shared with a family member by sending them a link via text message which designates them as a healthcare advocate.

MiHealTeam improves the quality of the patient’s hospital experience by storing medical updates and informing the patient and nursing staff of physician rounds through a broadcast function within the dashboard. 

Patient ratings are collected and generated in a comprehensive approach. This gives a report that is generated daily and more granular than conventional HCAHPS scoring methods. These scores and ratings help hospitals to maintain excellent quality of patient experiences to maintain and improve satisfaction among hospital patients. 

If the patient chooses to share their profile by texting a link to a family member, designated proxy, or friend the new user will be prompted to create an advocate profile. From the advocate profile, the patient’s documentation of care can be viewed and monitored. Monitoring patient care as an advocate can be used to help manage patients' precautions, or because of geographical or financial restraints that prevent physical presence by the advocate.

Nursing staff can communicate with patients through the MiHealTeam app. Virtual communication allows nurses to respond to patients, immediately, appropriately, and without unnecessary personnel disturbing the patient during convalescence.

Founded by physicians, for physicians in an effort to increase the quality of patient care, healthcare teamwork, and patient satisfaction. Backed by CEOs that strive for innovation, and excellence."

1. Download Friction on both your Mac and iPad
2. Plug your iPad into your Mac
3. Open Friction
4. Start drawing on your iPad!

**BLACK/WHITEBOARD**
Sometimes, you might need to draw diagrams on your Mac while screen sharing. Wouldn't it be nice to just turn your Mac's screen black or white? That's pretty much what the black/whiteboard feature does. Turn it on using View > Blackboard/Whiteboard.

**DOWNLOAD DRAWINGS**
Nice diagram, but how to save it? Well, you could screenshot it but that's not as fun as going up to File -> Download Drawing and the drawing will be saved to your Photos.

**REUSING DRAWINGS**
Maybe you're a teacher drawing a diagram. Drawing the same diagram over and over again is annoying and time consuming. Just draw it once, go to File -> Save to Sketches and it'll be in the Sketches folder. From your Sketches folder, just tap on a drawing and you can use them as many times as you want. You can also hold down on them to delete them."

"923798127";"Classroom Pencil Box";"Ideal for bigger screened devices and use of a stylus for pin point accuracy drawing. Pencil Box is an easy to use drawing application that enables you to take advantage of a pencil, pen, highlighter, pair of compasses, ruler and protractor. It also offers you some preset backgrounds in the form of a pie chart, square paper, a grid axes, isometric paper, square dot paper and a blue tint background. If any of these don't take your fancy, you can import your own background from your camera roll or camera and edit the pictures like an overlay.

The app also benefits from 8 different screens that students can draw on and now share with teaching staff and vice versa. The exciting new sharing platform allows students to send their workspace to the teacher, who can then review, edit and then share back with every learner with the same class/group code.

How could you use Pencil Box?
Snap shot classic mistakes and ask students to highlight them, give all students an exam question, ask students to mark a snapshot of work, set homework tasks, or simply use the app to easily display what students have been doing. Any more ideas or examples of good practise, send them to mrwslab@gmail.com.

Other quick lesson ideas:
1) Take a picture of an exam question, provide the model answer, save it to your camera roll and upload it to your website for students to see. Alternatively if you are a student, answer the question and send it to the teacher.
2) Similar shapes - if a partner stands 10m away from the base of a building, take a picture, draw on the picture a right angled triangle formed by the base of the building, the tip and your partner. Use the ruler to measure the dimensions of your triangle and can you use similar triangles to calculate the height of the building?
3) Trigonometry lesson - using the protractor to measure real life angles and use appropriate measurements to calculate heights or lengths.
4) Take a picture of a students work and ask a partner to peer assess.
5) Take examples of students work using the 8 different screens and share the positive features.
6) Import an image to the stage. Using the tools available, sketch over the imported picture to trace it. Remove the imported picture from the stage and your sketch will remain.

Idea 4 and 5 require a projector connector or wireless connection to display on a whiteboard. Hopefully the lesson ideas would be applicable to any Maths, Science, Design and Technology or Arts lesson. I am a Maths teacher so this list isn't exhaustive. If you have any ideas about how you might use it in Maths or another subject, please email them to mrwslab@gmail.com and I will add them to the app description.

As a teacher I wanted to create a powerful resource for the classroom. The following tools are invaluable and a freely built into the app:

Tools:
1) Pen, pencil, highlighter and eraser
2) Protractor
3) Pair of compasses
4) Ruler
5) Preset paper - pie chart, square paper, grid axes, isometric, square dot, lined, blue background and lesson plan template
6) Insert text
7) Import from camera roll or take a picture
8) Save to camera roll

I hope you like it.

"466102928";"Stickyboard 2";"Imagine a giant whiteboard with a never-ending stack of sticky notes, now with Magic Arrange!

LIKE REAL NOTES, ONLY BETTER

Nothing beats a whiteboard and sticky-notes for capturing lots of loose information and seeing the big picture. Stickyboard takes that flexibility and adds the convenience and power of your iPad. Don't worry about losing notes after a meeting again. It's much easier to carry around, and a lot friendlier for the environment.

Use any color coding system you like. Effortlessly move and group your notes - unlike paper sticky notes, they don't fall off after too may moves.

Think in the way that works best for you, and for the problem at hand.


NEATLY ARRANGE NOTES WITH A FLICK OF YOUR FINGERS

The most exciting feature of Stickyboard 2 is something we call Magic Arrange. One of the biggest pains of working with lots of sticky notes is having to arrange and rearrange them. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just wave your hands and have them neatly arrange themselves? Well, with the magic of the iPad and Stickyboard 2, now you can!

Just select a bunch of notes, then swipe with 3 fingers to instantly arrange them into neat piles, or fan them out into a grid, columns, or rows.

This is going to change the way you work with sticky notes, and you are never going to look at paper notes the same way again!

Try it out for yourself.


FULL FEATURED NOTES AND DRAWING

Thank you for all the great feedback! Stickyboard 2 is a major new release completely rebuilt from the ground up. Key features include:

- The Board Gallery: Easily manage multiple boards and quickly switch between them with the gallery view.

- Smoother Ink: The ink system in Stickyboard 2 is much improved over its predecessor. It supports multiple colors with stutter-free drawing.

- Unlimited undo/redo and Copy/Paste: Undo/redo works with notes and ink, just as you would expect. Tap on selected notes to copy/cut them, even to other boards. Working with large amounts of information is easy with Stickyboard 2.

- Email boards as PDF or just text: Whole boards can be easily emailed as PDF files, or opt to just send the text contents instead - very handy for using Stickyboard 2 as an outlining tool.

- Lasso Select: Simply run your finger around or through a group of notes to select them. This allows for much more precision than rectangular selection methods, and feels more intuitive on a multi-touch display.


SIMPLE YET POWERFUL

? Stickyboard 2 sports an elegant and intuitive interface. Double-tap to add a note. Select and drag notes around with your finger.

? You have a large, zoomable board to capture all your ideas. Zoom by pinching, and pan with 2 fingers.

? It's easy to rearrange ideas, capture their relationships, and discover important patterns.

? Use four standard colors (yellow, blue, pink, and green), plus 2 special ones (lavender and sunrise).

? Draw free-form with the marker tool. Write, outline, and sketch around your notes.

? Stickyboard 2 is infinitely flexible. Use your favorite real-world sticky-note and whiteboarding techniques.


Best regards from the Stickyboard team at Qrayon."

"963870901";"AlphaTopics - AAC";"Sometimes just giving a hint or context is all your listener needs to understand you. The first letter or two. The general topic. AlphaTopics is the perfect AAC app for people whose natural speech is not always clear. 

Stop wasting time navigating to the right word or typing it out. Get your point across faster by touching just the first few letters of the words you say. Give your listener context by starting the conversation with the topic. Write it out with your finger or draw a picture. Don’t let overly complicated apps slow you down. 

Tactus Therapy, a trusted name in speech therapy apps, brings you a new take on a classic communication tool.  AlphaTopics includes 3 AAC communication boards loaded with features:

1) Letter Board
- 26 letters in alphabetical order or 2 variations of frequency order
- 10 single digits allow you to express any number 
- Vowels highlighted and aligned for faster navigation
- Natural or automated speech reads out the name of each letter or number
- Yes, no, question, smiley, space, and backspace buttons for prosody and function

2) Topic Board 
- Fully customizable text you can re-order 
- Voice output with adjustable speech rate
- Two sizes of grid to display 12 or 24 topics
- Pre-filled with functional topics for adults

3) Whiteboard
- Write or draw on the screen
- 6 colors and 4 widths
- Export to Photos or e-mail

When used together, alphabet and topic boards have been scientifically shown to make the speech of people with motor speech disorders far more understandable. Combined with the whiteboard, these tools help people with aphasia express themselves more clearly with self-cueing and strategy use.

Stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and motor neuron disease are all conditions that can impair speech production.

Pointing to the first letter in each word not only gives the listener more information about the word, it also encourages the speaker to slow down and separate words, actually making the words clearer! Using alphabet supplementation, studies show intelligibility of sentences improves 25% on average.

Pointing to the topic before speaking narrows the range of possibilities for the listener, giving context. Studies show using a topic cue improves word understanding by an average of 28%. Topics can also be used by people with aphasia, a language disorder, to help pinpoint the intended message.

Additional Features:
*Adjustable settings for visual, physical, language, and cognitive impairments
*Works with built-in scanning and guided access
*4 color schemes
*Pick which board comes up when you start the app
*Export any board you've customized to print or share

""People whose speech is hard to understand often just want to provide extra clues to their listener and don’t require all the features of a comprehensive AAC app.  It’s terrific that we now have an app that provides this level of support on a mobile platform.” - Lois Turner, SLP & AAC specialist

Visit tactustherapy.com for more information on how to use this app, the evidence to support this form of AAC, and a day-by-day account of how this app was made."

~~ THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND MUSE ~~

Muse is your creative sanctuary for thinking work. Use it to push yourself mentally and emotionally as far as you can go to find a pure, original, fresh result that is yours and yours alone. Here are some principles we used in designing Muse as a tool purpose-built for thinking.

-> Thinking is messy. Embrace the non-linear chaos of creativity. Don’t force labels, organization, or structure too early.

-> Ideas come from other ideas. Breakthroughs come from discovering new connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information.

-> Ideas love a sanctuary. Creativity is an act of vulnerability. Deep thinking needs a dedicated space that gives you confidence to express half-formed ideas, without fear of mistakes or judgement.

-> Tap the information firehose, but keep it at a distance. A thinking tool should help you take advantage of social media, email, and the web — without drowning out your own voice and original ideas.

-> People think best away from their desks. Reading in a relaxed posture in your armchair, sketching in a notebook in your favorite cafe, taking a long walk in the park — these are where some of our best ideas and freshest thinking emerge.

"1487762709";"Sphere";"Central Hub. Sphere helps you manage and grow your real estate business. Sphere was designed by top agents. It gets rid of the post-it notes, whiteboards and spreadsheets and tracks of everything in one place - every aspect of all transactions, To Do lists, contacts, deadlines, doc archive, and much more. It is easily accessible to anyone with a Sphere account from any device (laptop, phone, tablet).

20% More Sales. The average Sphere user sales increased by over 20% in the first 12 months. Top users exceed 100%. A solid system for managing your business results in higher closure rates and creates more time to pursue new sales (as well as more free time).

Business Plan. In just a couple of minutes, Sphere creates an annual business plan tailored to your business. It then generates a daily dashboard and monthly reports to keep you up to date on your progress. To help hit sales targets it creates a daily lead generation contact list and makes it easy to see whether you are hitting your referral goals.

Gmail & Outlook. Sphere syncs with Google and Outlook calendars so every date and deadline from open houses to house anniversaries are always with you. It also syncs and organizes Gmail and Outlook emails so you always have a searchable list of all conversations with each client.

Coaching. Sphere highlights important action steps each day for sales growth. It provides monthly ideas for ways to engage your sphere. It creates birthday and housiversary notifications, as well as detailed monthly and annual business reports with metrics on progress toward goals, opportunities for growth, and best practice tips.

Teams. Sphere recently rolled out functionality for teams. Different roles have different privileges and access to different data and functionality. Team leaders have access to a dashboard with performance metrics on each team member as well as the team as a whole. Organization is even more important for teams and a collaborative platform is essential.

TCs. Sphere will shortly roll out Transaction Coordinator functionality we believe will be the best TC software on the market and will allows TCs to easily be included in any agents transaction.

Full CRM. Including functionality that automatically finds and integrates your contacts’ social media accounts so you always have current details and easy insight into what’s new in their lives (e.g. “Wow, Jessica Lee just had twins. I wonder if they need a new place.”)

Email Marketing. Sphere makes it easy to send email blast or newsletters to clients (similar to MailChimp).

External Services. Sphere already integrates a service that provides realtor supplies (branded signs, hats, shoe covers) for which we receive a percentage of sales. We plan to add additional services in the future.

Sticky. Most agents who try it even very briefly feel it's a really valuable tool. Our conversion and retention rates have been far higher than we’d thought was possible. More than 90% of agents enter a goal or a single transaction convert from trial to premium users.

Free for New Agents. Sphere is free for any new agent (licensed in the last 12 months) until they hit $2M in transactions. We hope by providing Sphere we’ll meaningfully increase new agents chances of becoming successful and they stick with us once they are.

Präsentationen und Konferenzen: Treffen Sie Ihre Kommunikationspartner im sicheren virtuellen Meeting-Raum (Zugang per Teilnehmer-Link).

Screen-Sharing: Teilen Sie einen zweiten Bildschirm mit Teilnehmern, z. B. mit Materialien. Diese Funktion lässt sich auf alle Teilnehmer erweitern.

Datei-Austausch: Komfortable Up- und Download-Funktion – stellen Sie den Teilnehmern Ihrer Videokonferenz direkt im Tool begleitendes Material zur Verfügung.

Gruppenräume: Verteilen Sie die Teilnehmer Ihres Meetings in Kleingruppen auf verschiedene virtuelle Räume, um so noch interaktiver und effizienter arbeiten zu können.

Wortbeiträge managen: Sobald ein Teilnehmer den Button „Hand heben“ anklickt, erhält der Moderator eine Meldung und kann darauf reagieren.

Whiteboard: Erarbeiten Sie als Moderator zusammen mit Ihren Teilnehmern Inhalte, ohne den Bildschirm teilen zu müssen – auf der „digitalen Tafel“ oder in bestehenden Dokumenten.

Live-Chat: Bleiben Sie im Dialog, beantworten Sie Fragen der Teilnehmer. Ganz einfach über Chat-Beiträge, die Sie als Moderator bzw. Dozent verwalten.

Einladungsmanagement: Verwaltung der Teilnehmer, sodass nur ein geschlossener Personenkreis an einer Veranstaltung teilnehmen kann.

Mehrere Moderatoren: Eine Veranstaltung kann von mehreren Moderatoren betreut werden – der Dozent kann sich auf seine Rolle als Präsentator konzentrieren.

Anwesenheits-Check: Mit der automatisierten Abfrage behalten Sie den Überblick, ob alle Teilnehmer anwesend sind bzw. in welchen Zeitfenstern sie abwesend waren (außerdem Excel-Report).

Aufzeichnen: Mit einem Klick werden Webcam und Mikrofon des Moderators aufgezeichnet, lokales Speichern der aufgezeichneten Videokonferenz ist im Anschluss möglich.

Mobiltauglich: Auch eine Teilnahme mit einem Smartphone oder Tablet ist möglich; ggf. gibt es Einschränkungen wegen der Bildschirmgröße.

Push-to-talk: Ideal bei mehreren Teilnehmern – das Mikrofon bleibt aus und lässt sich per Tastendruck bei Bedarf kurzzeitig aktivieren. Dies gewährleistet eine geregelte Kommunikation.

Telefon-Einwahl: Ein Teilnehmer ist unterwegs oder hat kein Mikrofon und/oder keinen Lautsprecher am PC? Dann kann er sich mit dem Telefon einwählen und so an der Unterhaltung teilnehmen.

Warteraum: Mit dem Warteraum kann ein Moderator steuern, wer wann der Videokonferenz beitritt – ausgewählte Teilnehmer oder alle. Ist der Warteraum aktiviert, führt der Teilnehmer-Link zunächst in diesen Raum.

Abstimmung: Sie möchten eine Abstimmung während einer Videokonferenz durchführen? Visavid ermöglicht dem Moderator Schnellumfragen, die sich individuell erstellen und auswerten lassen.

Branding: Organisieren Sie eine Videokonferenz mit Ihrem Firmen- oder Markennamen. Laden Sie einfach Ihr Logo hoch, dann wird es bei der Anmeldung in einem Raum angezeigt.

Passwortschutz: Mehr Sicherheit durch zusätzlichen Passwort-Schutz. Ein optionaler Einwahl-Code verhindert das unerwünschte und störende Eindringen in Ihre Videokonferenz.

Untertitel: Der Moderator kann in einer Videokonferenz automatische oder manuelle Untertitel für Teilnehmer mit Hörschwäche anzeigen lassen."

"1294105620";"Endless Paper";"** Please note that Endless Paper requires an Apple Pencil or Logitech Crayon, other styluses are not supported. **

Introducing Endless Paper, an all-new kind of App featuring an infinite canvas which lets you take handwritten notes, sketch diagrams, explore and grow ideas visually, brainstorm with your team, organize your thoughts spatially, and so much more…
Deliberately simple yet powerful, incredibly fast, Endless Paper is as natural to use as pen & paper without the limitations of physical medium.

Whether you're an engineer needing to visualize a problem, a designer wireframing your next UI, a student taking notes, a teacher giving captivating lectures, a manager brainstorming on the next big thing with your team, a scientist working on long formulas, Endless Paper is the ideal tool to help you think and communicate visually.

Highlights:
• Infinite canvas
• Spatial organization
• Broadcast your whiteboard on the web
• Designed & optimized for iPad & Apple Pencil
• Powered by Fractile: Metal-accelerated, 64-bit vector rendering engine
• Drag & Drop of images
• Color wheel with nearly 120 hand-picked colors & Advanced HSB Chooser
• Bookmarks to quickly retrieve your content
• Toolbar optimized for two hands operations
• Presentation mode with support for Bluetooth remote/clickers
• Unlimited undo and redo
• Continuous auto-save

The Best Whiteboard
Have you ever started to sketch an idea on paper only to find out you won't have enough room to finish? With Endless Paper, you will never have to re-start from scratch on a blank page, to erase your whiteboard to make room, or, more importantly, to limit yourself because of the lack of space.
Every big idea starts small, and we know how fragile nascent ideas can be, so we deliberately designed a malleable tool that encourages exploration when you need it the most, when your ideas are the most vulnerable.

Organize your Content Spatially
Spatial organization is prevalent in our daily life: your kitchen, your desk, the city you live in, are all organized spatially. A calendar is time turned into space.
Yet most of our digital tools deprive us of this profoundly humane organization method.
Thanks to its unique infinite canvas, Endless Paper lets you organize your content spatially.
You can focus on the minute details of your project and quickly step back to see the big picture. 
It gives a sense of place to your work without artificial separation between document management and the documents themselves. 
Everything you can do on the document level can be done at any level. It all just works in a surprisingly consistent way.

Worth a Thousand Words
Import images directly onto your canvas.
Make your notes come alive. Collect ideas in mood boards. Take pictures and pin them.
Import study material, stickies, or that paper template you rely on.
Endless Paper supports drag & drop from Photos, Files, Safari...just about any app really.

Deceptively Simple, Incredibly Powerful
Endless Paper is designed to be natural to use. But this is no purposeless minimalism.
Interactions are as simple as possible in order to minimize errors & cognitive load.
This lets you dedicate 100% of your brain to the task at hand.
Interactions feel second nature, especially important in stressful situations or when you hand over your iPad to someone who has never used the App before.
And in case you made a mistake, you have unlimited undo & redo and everything saves automatically.

Designed for iPad & Apple Pencil
The tailor-made Fractile vector rendering engine delivers unparalleled level of performance: Whenever you are panning, zooming or writing, you always get ultra-crisp, retina quality, vector rendering at a silky smooth 120fps, even with millions of strokes simultaneously on screen.
Canvases accumulating years’ worth of notes will open instantly. No sweat.
It all participates in an almost unreal, magical experience."

"412443803";"Doceri Interactive Whiteboard";"Combining screencasting, desktop control, and an interactive whiteboard in one app, you’ll never have to turn your back to the class or audience again. Create a lesson or presentation, insert images, save and edit your project and record a screencast video you can easily save or share. Doceri does it all!

Control your lesson or presentation live with Airplay or through your Mac or PC. Annotate a Keynote or PowerPoint, or present your original Doceri project. Great for student projects, too.

CREATE hand-written or hand-drawn Doceri projects on your iPad, using sophisticated drawing tools and the innovative Doceri Timeline. Unlike other drawing and screencast apps, Doceri uses timeline-based editing so original lessons are always saved, even after a screencast recording is created. All drawing strokes, photos or hand-drawn objects can be cut, pasted or resized at any point in the timeline. This enables easy creation and reuse of engaging presentations and high-quality, flipped classroom screencasts. 

CONTROL a computer through your iPad. When connected wirelessly to a classroom computer via our Doceri Desktop software, you can access and control any program or file on your desktop. Access all of your pedagogical materials through your tablet – even play flash video through your iPad. Download Doceri Desktop software at www.Doceri.com. You can also control your classroom AV system from the iPad with SP Controls’ AV Control Systems. 

PRESENT anything from your Mac or PC connected to a projector, using Doceri Desktop software. Present without a computer through Doceri’s special support for Apple TV. Your audience sees only the presentation area of your Doceri screen - not the tool bars or rotations.  

SHARE images, PDFs and videos any way you’d like. Rather than requiring login to a proprietary web site, Doceri lessons can be saved to your Camera Roll or shared via other apps you have installed on your iPad, so you can upload to your Web site, LMS or other platform of your choice. Share your images and video screencasts directly to YouTube, Twitter or Facebook from within the app. 

TRY BEFORE YOU BUY with this fully-featured free app. We’ve created Doceri  with a watermark that will be added to the images, PDFs and screencast videos that you share. You can remove or customize this watermark with an in app purchase - we believe that you should be able to try all of Doceri's features before you decide to purchase and support our work via the watermark removal.

What Teachers are saying About Doceri

Doceri has consistently received an average of 4½ stars on the iTunes App Store. 94% of Doceri teachers surveyed in May 2013 saw an improvement in classroom management since beginning to use Doceri, because they can teach while moving around among their students to keep them on task.

“Doceri allows me to present a lesson from anywhere in the classroom; a big plus when trying to manage 32+ middle school students. To actually see what I am writing and replay it while facing my students with my back to the board is amazing! I can work out equations ahead of time, or live in front of the students.”
- Anne Whitman, 7th grade math teacher at Oakdale Jr. High in California

“I love that I am not stuck behind my computer to use my computer. With Doceri, I can teach and circulate to help with classroom management. The students like that they can write on the screen from their desks. They also like that I can sit or stand by them and still teach and write on the screen.”
- Kristine Marsden, Ocoee Middle School in Ocoee, Florida"

Olocal includes both a public side and a private side. The public website includes posts of events, places, blogs, providers (businesses and organizations), public conversations and groups.

The private side of Olocal is for members. Each member has their own site within Olocal that we call a portal. A portal is customizable, and is the launch pad from where you can see all of your friends and any groups you created or joined, and choose what you want to do next. For example, you might talk to one or many people over text (audio and video chat coming soon), create posts on your portal or also include them on the main site, create a gallery of images, videos, and documents, set up meetings, buy people’s creations, or create or respond to classifieds and job listings.

You can also create or join circles which are our unique way of organizing groups of people for posting thoughts and information on your own portal or also on the main site, and facilitating private or public conversations over text, audio and video, along with collaboration tools such as shared documents, screens and whiteboards — kind of chat meets forums meets microblogging meets collaboration tools.

The Olocal platform is a different approach to social interaction on multiple levels – locally focused, serving members rather than advertisers, socially conscious and inclusive, supporting artists and creators, combining multiple web and social media technologies that together are greater than the sum of the parts, and designed to enhance your local community rather than replace it."

"1377946463";"A.R. Chem";"Important/Interesting molecules are divided into nine different groups; “Chemical Weaponry”, “Controlled Substances”, “Various Organic Molecules”, “Medicines”, “Interesting Natural Products”, “Biological Molecules”, “Chemical Toxins”, “Explosives”, and “Carbon Compounds”. After a category is chosen, several molecules of interest are shown on two-dimensional whiteboards. When one of those molecules is selected it appears in three-dimensions and interesting facts are narrated. In addition, one can interact with the molecule; e.g., change its size and orientation. This App will help make the connection between two- and three-dimensional depictions of molecules reinforcing molecular geometry principles as well as learning interesting facts for over 50 important/interesting molecules. 
Unfortunately, the study of chemistry has traditionally always been taught in two-dimensions; e.g., a page in a book, a PowerPoint, or the whiteboard during lecture. However, molecules and reactions of these molecules occur in three-dimensions and the student who cannot imagine or draw these molecules in three-dimensions inevitably does not pass.  In addition, the study of chemistry requires an understanding of how atoms within molecules are oriented in three-dimensions, conformational changes of these molecules, stereochemical principles of these molecules, and the changes these molecules undergo during reactions (reaction mechanisms). The student who has mastered the ability to visualize molecules in three-dimensions; e.g., molecular geometry, conformational changes, and stereochemical principles, is rewarded with a better understanding of chemical and physical properties, and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to predict chemical reactivity as well as draw/predict organic chemistry mechanisms.  We propose our solution via three-dimensional VR chemistry teaching/review tools to help high school and college chemistry students as well as appeal to anyone of all ages who is interested in learning basic chemistry principles.

"548963674";"Lacrosse WhiteBoard";"Now, updated for 64-bit systems and iOS 7 and newer!

Lacrosse WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase lacrosse coach's white board. It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field! You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display). Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number. You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the player's name) underneath the circle. Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall. You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards. Based on Soccer WhiteBoard which was originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of it's kind! It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years! Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Lacrosse WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback. 

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board. By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen. To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette. iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Lacrosse WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Lacrosse WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud! Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices. The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision. Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported. 

Lacrosse WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Lacrosse WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

Finally, an effortless streaming experience to Facebook, Youtube, Twitch, TikTok, your website, or any custom RTMP destinations–it’s perfect if you’re a content creator, podcaster, sports club, or videographer for social and corporate events.

- PERSONALIZE/BRAND YOUR LIVE STREAMS OR PODCASTS
Insert logos, overlays, speaker names, and other visuals during your live stream–giving your production an instant “It’s like a TV studio!” wow factor

- USE MULTIPLE CAMERA ANGLES FOR A SHOW-STOPPING STREAM
Use as many devices and camera angles as you need–you can link up to 12 phones and/or tablets into a live streaming chain. For a more immersive experience audiences love, switch between camera angles often during streaming (vs. making a single-camera yawn-inducing production).

- EDIT SOUND LIVE WITH THE STUDIO’S BUILT-IN AUDIO MIXER
Adjust and balance the sound during your live stream for each device independently from the studio device’s audio mixer–this is huge. When you see people chatting next to a device you’re using to record or live stream, you can mute the mic on it from where you sit! Shhh!

- USE WHATEVER LENS YOU PREFER (FRONT, BACK, ULTRA-WIDE)
Switch between the front and back cameras without walking up to the device during your streams–handy during live Q&As when the mic is handed to someone in the audience

- ADJUST WHITE BALANCE
Individually, on all cameras–perfect when the sun decides to come out/hide and the video suddenly goes cold/warm as your stream goes on

- USE THE FLASH WHEN YOU NEED IT
Turn the flash on and off independently for each device–ideal when you're streaming on cloudy days and the room becomes darker... and what was a bright spot when you set up is now dark

- ZOOM IN AND OUT FROM YOUR STUDIO DEVICE
Individually, on all cameras–insanely useful when streaming whiteboard presentations with ridiculously small letters even the audience in the room can’t see (...  imagine the people watching the steam!)

- ADJUST LATENCY WHEN YOU NEED TO
Adjust your external camera’s latency settings according to the quality of your WiFi connection as you're streaming–perfect for balancing the data flow (audio & video) from your individual cameras

- ENJOY AUTOMATIC STREAM BITRATE BALANCING
It’s streaming magic in the background–a generous 10-second buffer zone irons out sudden changes in your upload speed during your live stream

- LIVE STREAM, RECORD, OR BOTH
Record your live stream and save it on your local device–edit and repurpose later to get the most ROI for your efforts

- MANAGE YOUR DEVICES REMOTELY
Orchestrate your entire stream from inside the intuitive live video studio app while sitting down at the back of the room with a coffee–it’s that easy to use

- MINIMAL LEARNING CURVE
When you’re stuck or need help, navigate to the tutorial section or contact the live video support team for a solution.
Grab a seat in this powerful live video production studio and enjoy pro live streaming and video content creation–with your mobile devices.

"455525937";"Coach's Clock";"Keep track of your players' time on the field with Coach's Clock.

Designed with input from a youth soccer coach who manages multiple teams each season, Coach's Clock is a very simple application that runs on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It keeps track of all of the players on your team, where they are supposed to be on the field, and how long they've been playing since they were last substituted into the game.

Just enter in your team name and your player roster. Drag your players on and off the field and tap the clock to start it running. Players on the field accrue elapsed time. Players off the field do not. It's that simple.

What Coach's Clock does:

* It tracks how much time has elapsed in the current play period.
* It tracks the position of every player on your team.
* It keeps track of how long each player has been on the field.
* It helps you plan player substitutions.
* It has field backgrounds for basketball, field hockey, football, hockey and soccer but it could also be used for any similar sport.
* It supports an unlimited number of teams.
* It has detailed usage instructions right inside the app.
* It's a ""universal app"" so one purchase is good for all your iDevices!

What it doesn't do:

* Coach's Clock doesn't force you to keep the app running throughout your game. You are free to close it, open other apps, take phone calls, or whatever you like. You only need to run it when you want to refer to it or when you need to make a change. The clocks keep time even when the app isn't running.
* Coach's Clock is not a replacement for your whiteboard or playbook. (There are plenty of other fine apps which can do that for you.)

Coach's Clock may seem like a pretty simple app, and it is! But that's the beauty of it. It doesn't try to do everything for you; instead it tries to do a few essential things very well. It doesn't try to change the way you coach your team; it just makes your job a little easier."

"1252736175";"Noteflow+ Digital Notebook";"Noteflow is designed to replace pen and paper. It is a modern digital notebook that lets you get the most out of your iPad or iPhone.

Use it for taking notes, annotating PDFs, sketching and doodling, plus a whole lot more:

Copy and paste from the real world: Use Inkport gen 2 to snap a picture of a whiteboard or writing and convert it into Noteflow's native vector ink. No special paper needed. Then resize, re-color, or edit as if you wrote it in Noteflow.

Create layered drawings without layers: Use the highlighter tool to color and shade behind existing ink. Use Color-Select to separate and edit individual colors. It's a much more fluid and natural editing experience than with layers. Use the straight-line tool with a grid for fast and intuitive wireframes and drafting.

Drag-and-drop, cloud-storage, and more: Noteflow natively integrates with iOS's file system and drag-and-drop capabilities. Drop photos and text into Noteflow, and drag your drawings into other apps. Store your files locally or sync with the cloud service of your choice. Make Noteflow a seamless part of your workflow, the way you like.

SPACE FOR YOUR IDEAS TO ROAM

Our vision for Noteflow is simple: to be digital pen and paper.

The magic of pen and paper is in their versatility. They are useful for so many things, but particularly for the freeform capture of ideas. Noteflow expands upon this quality.

You can naturally do all the things you normally do with pen and paper: take notes in meetings or class, and jot down flashes of inspirations on the go. And you can take that to a whole new level:

One of Noteflow’s best uses is for ""thinking on digital paper"": quickly capture key ideas and concepts, then move and organize them on the screen.

Noteflow's vector ink engine lets you scale and edit your work without any loss of quality. Your words and drawings remain tack sharp when zoomed in, giving you a huge effective working canvas even on a single page.

There are analogues in the physical world, such as sketchnotes or everyday working on a white board, but being able to fluidly edit and move your ideas around the page is something you can only do digitally.

When you represent the ideas in your head with your own personal scribbles on the screen, it effectively becomes an extension of your mind - giving you more room to think.

We've designed every part of Noteflow  to let you intuitively capture and work on your ideas the way you like. Whether it's dropping in existing information, quickly sketching concepts, or assembling polished presentations for others.

By resizing ink and zooming in, you have a huge effective canvas to work with, even on a single page.

As your ideas shape up, Noteflow has all the tools you need to tidy them up and format them to share with others.

DIGITAL TOOLS FOR A DIGITAL AGE

I hope you'll find Noteflow a useful part of your workflow, and that you'll discover new ways to do things with it that weren't easy before.

We're very proud of the work we've put into Noteflow, but we're also just seen the beginning of what's possible with powerful new digital platforms like the iPad.

Our goal is to push these platforms to their limits to craft useful tools. Tools that can help us think a little more clearly, communicate a bit more effectively, and connect with other in new and enriching ways.

Thanks for joining us on this journey!

"657372172";"Teaching Money";"Little Monkey Apps Teaching Money provides another format to help your students become more familiar with money, recognising coins and notes, paying for objects, coins and notes of equal value and giving change. 

The App is split into a teaching module and five task based modules; Sorting coins and notes, Piggy Bank, Toy Store, Giving Change and Show Me. At this stage, Little Monkey Apps Teaching money is in Australian Dollars, UK Sterling and US Dollars. All coins and notes have been altered in line with country laws. (We've put our logo on!) Use the flag to select the currency. Apologies if we keep saying dollars, but you know what we mean! Use the settings tool to have coins start on tails or a mix of heads and tails.

Little Monkey Apps Teaching Money is aimed at providing digital scenarios or task based money questions. It does not replace the importance of play based and open ended real life experiences. The App enhances your classroom pedagogy, by providing a different way of presenting the same curriculum standard. 

Teacher Tool
A blank screen with coins at the side. Use this tool to discuss money, look at the notes, give verbal scenarios to children etc. Use the pencil tool just as you would use a whiteboard, then the camera tool to record what the student has achieved. You might like to use it in their learning portfolio, revisit the problem in a subsequent lesson, display on your large screen to discuss with a small or whole group etc. 

Don't forget to use real coins with your students (plastic or laminated ones too) for that shop corner you are going to set up or for all those fantastic money games that you have. Personal favourites are money stamps and an ink pad, coin rubbing, bingo, card match, 'learn to earn' days and board games which use money. 

Sorting coins and notes
This task asks the student to sort the coins and notes from the middle plate to the correctly labelled plate. If they get a coin or note incorrect, the plate, the coin or note wobbles once the coins and notes have ALL been placed. This way, they have a chance to self correct before being told they are wrong immediately. Three levels, coins, notes and coins and notes. Double click the coin to turn the coin or note to its alternate side.  

Piggy Bank
Put the coins and notes in the piggy bank to see the money added up. Double click the pig or shake the iPad to tip the money back out.  Use as a helper to addition problems or worded pocket money. Or let the children play to see how much money they can possibly put in! 

Toy Store
This task asks students to buy more than one toy for the amount given. Level 1 up to ten dollars through to level nine up to $250. its highly unlikely that young students would be able to do level nine, but we had one child who was ACE at adding money so we put this in for him!

Off the iPad, we suggest setting up a toy fruit store or bakery, toy cash register, toy money and allowing the children to PLAY, PLAY, PLAY in this area. You also might like to visit a local market and have each group of children buy a set of items (or one item each), returning to school to make fruit salad (or something else you are allowed to do).You might even get onto the discussion of price differences and price per weight amount.

Giving Change
The student is asked to put coins into the hand for the change they will get from the given amount. Level 1 up to ten dollars, up to level 5 for $20 with a note and coin change. 

Show Me
This module asks you to show two different ways of making a value e.g. five dollars, placing the two separate ways on the two plates. Levels one asks for up to one dollar to level five up to twenty dollars. It is great teaching point to watch and ask students why they chose a particular way of making up the amount. Similarly, you could have students work in pairs to encourage the verbal discussion of how to go about the task."

Easy to use, Lovely Pets is created especially for children.
The game is divided into 16 exercises, each containing a series of images and a description of a pet.
At the bottom left, the exercise number is indicated to keep track of where you are in the app.

HOW TO PLAY
The exercise presents sixteen drawings of sixteen descriptions of a pet. Each paragraph of text appears alongside the sixteen drawings. The pet which corresponds to the description must be identified. Once the pet is found, the user must slide the coloured bubble above the image of the pet. If the answer is correct, a signal appears. Otherwise, the player can try again or passes on to the next paragraph of text. Once all sixteen drawings have been identified and each bubble is in place, the game is over.

SnapType helps students keep up with their peers in class even when their penmanship holds them back. Students can easily complete school worksheets with the help of an iPad or iPhone.

With SnapType, students can take a picture of their worksheets, or import worksheets from anywhere on their device. They can then use their iOS device keyboard to add text to these documents and print, email, or share their creations. It is the perfect solution for kids, and even adults, who struggle with their handwriting. Just read a few of our amazing testimonials:

""Dear Amberlynn, Thank you so much for creating this app. You have changed the way my 12 year old son with dyspraxia functions in school. He is more independent and I cannot thank you enough. Please continue to help kids like my son. You are changing lives. Thank you.""

""Thank you for this ! I am going to talk to my sons teachers about this -you are a blessing ! I can honestly tell you that I have spent many hours crying inside an Hurting watching my son struggle to write pages of sentences and spelling words and other homework - to the point that I have stopped him and honestly wrote for him left handed to make it look more like a neater version of his because I could not take it anymore ! Thank you""

""I just wanted to personally thank you for creating it, as this is an app that I use nearly every day with my son to do his homework. You have created an app with a simple interface, but with an incredibly powerful impact. Thank you.""

""It is wonderful and something so simple yet so so so important for little guys like mine who cannot write BUT is learning to type and has so much to say and SHOW.""

""We trialed SnapType with an 8-year old who is receiving school-based occupational therapy due to visual motor and visual perceptual issues. The biggest complaint from teachers about handwriting for this student was related to illegible answers on worksheets. The student quickly learned to take images of the worksheets with her iPad, upload them to the device and type in her answers. In addition to making her writing legible and eliminating issues with visual perceptual skills, the child's interest in the task was greatly improved, as was her pride in her work.""

""Thank you so much Amberlynn. What a wonderful idea and gift to those kids that struggle with dysgraphia. I have converted many a workbook page for my son. This is WONDERFUL!""

""Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm a mother of twins. My son is autistic and my daughter has cerebral palsy. They are still only 2 and a half... but I'm sure they will both need and use this. The fact that you have also made it free and are paying for it out of pocket is just the sweetest thing ever. I read about this last night and cried tears of joy. You are amazing! And I'm going to be telling everyone who will listen about you, this story, and your app. Thank you again, I truly appreciate it!!”"

And, unlike the napkin you draw on at lunch, diagrams from the program can look good enough to use in books and professional journals without further enhancements.” — George Huba, hubaisms.

Just sketch some rough shapes, type in some text, then link them together. Instaviz neatens the shapes and arranges them elegantly as you work — out pops a beautiful, tidy diagram. No fussing about with precise appearance or absolute placement, or getting stuck in popups, gadgets, modes or menus.

“Instaviz’s impressive strength is the way that it intelligently rearranges your flowchart for an optimal layout on the fly. Watching boxes and lines reorganize when you’ve got your flowchart into a jumble, by not planning ahead sufficiently, is quite cathartic.” — 4.5/5 Stephen Northcott, Touch Reviews.

"1252732105";"Noteflow Digital Notebook";"Noteflow is designed to replace pen and paper. It is a modern digital notebook that lets you get the most from your iPad and iPhone.

Use it for taking notes, annotating PDFs, sketching and doodling, plus a whole lot more:

Copy and paste from the real world: Use Inkport gen 2 to snap a picture of a whiteboard or writing and convert it into Noteflow's native vector ink. No special paper needed. Then resize, re-color, or edit as if you wrote it in Noteflow.

Create layered drawings without layers: Use the highlighter tool to color and shade behind existing ink. Use Color-Select to separate and edit individual colors. It's a much more fluid and natural editing experience than with layers. Use the straight-line tool with a grid for fast and intuitive wireframes and drafting.

Drag-and-drop, cloud-storage, and more: Noteflow natively integrates with iOS's file system and drag-and-drop capabilities. Drop photos and text into Noteflow, and drag your drawings into other apps. Store your files locally or sync with the cloud service of your choice. Make Noteflow a seamless part of your workflow, the way you like.

SPACE FOR YOUR IDEAS TO ROAM

Our vision for Noteflow is simple: to be digital pen and paper.

The magic of pen and paper is in their versatility. They are useful for so many things, but particularly for the freeform capture of ideas. Noteflow expands upon this quality.

You can naturally do all the things you normally do with pen and paper: take notes in meetings or class, and jot down flashes of inspirations on the go. And you can take that to a whole new level:

One of Noteflow’s best uses is for ""thinking on digital paper"": quickly capture key ideas and concepts, then move and organize them on the screen.

Noteflow's vector ink engine lets you scale and edit your work without any loss of quality. Your words and drawings remain tack sharp when zoomed in, giving you a huge effective working canvas even on a single page.

There are analogues in the physical world, such as sketchnotes or everyday working on a white board, but being able to fluidly edit and move your ideas around the page is something you can only do digitally.

When you represent the ideas in your head with your own personal scribbles on the screen, it effectively becomes an extension of your mind - giving you more room to think.

We've designed every part of Noteflow  to let you intuitively capture and work on your ideas the way you like. Whether it's dropping in existing information, quickly sketching concepts, or assembling polished presentations for others.

EVALUATE NOTEFLOW RISK FREE

Rather than just read about Noteflow, go ahead and try it out: We've decided to make the Basic Edition completely FREE. The Basic Edition is a full featured note-taking and sketching app. It comes with the Fountain Pen with black ink, photos, and a standard set of 5 popular fonts for text. Books max out at 20 pages each, but you can create as many as you like.

NOTEFLOW+

Upgrade instantly at any time to get:
+ Inkport
+ Import and annotate PDFs
+ A customizable, full color palette,
+ The Marker, Write-Behind Highlighter and Straight Line tools.
+ Rotate, Cut, Copy, Paste Ink, and Page Management,
+ Notebooks with unlimited pages,
+ Page backgrounds and sizes,
+ An additional 50+ fonts,
+ And more!

Learn more in the in-app Quickstart Guide.

DIGITAL TOOLS FOR A DIGITAL AGE

I hope you'll find Noteflow a useful part of your workflow, and that you'll discover new ways to do things with it that weren't easy before.

We're very proud of the work we've put into Noteflow, but we're also just seen the beginning of what's possible with powerful new digital platforms like the iPad.

Our goal is to push these platforms to their limits to craft useful tools. Tools that can help us think a little more clearly, communicate a bit more effectively, and connect with other in new and enriching ways.

Thanks for joining us on this journey!

Joanna Stern, The Wall St. Journal – “how I do all my live TV hits”
MacWorld US – “full-featured, easy-to-use, and delightful”
9to5Mac – “an easy way to seriously improve your video call quality”
WIRED – “there are a number of apps which let you use your iOS device’s camera as your webcam, but the best one is Camo”
MacWorld UK – “an easy way to beef up the video quality on your calls”

With over 10 million users helped over the last decade, Reincubate is one of the UK’s most-loved software companies.

— EASY TO USE / PLUG AND PLAY / Wi-Fi —

No extra hardware needed, just connect your device to your Mac or PC. Choose between connecting wirelessly, for the most flexible experience, or opt for a trusty USB connection. With Wi-Fi connectivity, get set up for a call in seconds – no more looking around for a spare cable or a free port.

— POWERFUL ADJUSTMENTS & FILTERS —

Camo Studio gives you full control of your video, letting you adjust lenses, exposure, colours, contrast, and more; and it lets you zoom, crop, and focus your image precisely how you want it. Apply cinematic styling and colour grading to your video with 18 bespoke filters, including support for custom Cube, 3DL, and LUT files.

— STAND OUT WITH SPOTLIGHT & PORTRAIT —

Use Spotlight to compensate for less-than-ideal lighting conditions, such as backlit or under-lit environments, by brightening yourself against your background. Portrait creates a sophisticated bokeh effect that cleanly separates you from the background and gives you full control over the depth of focus. 

— VIRTUAL GREEN SCREEN AND PRIVACY —

Use Replace, Camo’s virtual green screen, to cleanly swap any image into your background. Or activate Privacy to cloak your surroundings with a pleasing diffused image effect. Both offer industry-leading performance, enabling video that foregrounds clarity without sacrificing appearance.

— FIND FREEDOM WITH AUTO FRAMING —

Camo’s auto-framing functionality keeps you at the centre of the action, whether you’re shuffling around at your desk or presenting at a whiteboard. With a range of zoom options, you’ll remain firmly centred and proportioned on screen.

 — COMPATIBLE WITH OVER 40 APPS —

Camo works perfectly with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Safari, FaceTime, QuickTime, Chrome, OBS Studio, Streamlabs, Skype, Twitch, Panopto, ScreenFlow, Final Cut Pro X, and dozens of other video recording and streaming products.

— SECURITY AND PRIVACY FIRST —

Camo doesn’t know what you’re using it for, and doesn’t capture or transmit your video feed. It simply routes it from your iPhone to your computer. Your data is your business, not ours.

— NOT ONLY BUT ALSO! —

- Super low latency, high speed video with a range of resolutions
- Powerful presets to save and quickly switch to your favourite adjustments and settings
- Native support for iPadOS as well as your iPhone, and beautiful Dark Mode support throughout
- Camo offloads all processing to your iOS device, keeping your computer cool and fast
- Crop your video without losing quality with dynamic-resolution Smart Zoom
- Automatic image stabilisation minimises bumps and vibrations
- Virtually rotate your video without touching your device
- Switch between video from multiple iOS devices and lenses in real-time
- No ads in the app, not ever

"1062108984";"Optician Study";"The main feature of this app is that it generates problems and their solutions.  Most study guides have only a few problems and when you're done with them you're not sure you really know how to do the problem.  With this app, just hit ""New Problem"" and a  new problem will be generated.....then after you've worked the problem hit ""Show Answer"" and the answer along with a description of how that answer was arrived at  will be displayed.  If you want some instruction hit the ""Whiteboard"" button and an explanation of the concepts involved in the problem you're currently working on will be displayed.  Also, the arrow keys take you to extended instruction on the current topic.
     The type of problem is selected be moving the selector wheel on the bottom.  Start with the first in the list, when you've mastered that go to the next ""chapter"".   The units go from Optical Cross to Transposing, then Combining Lateral and Vertical Prism and ending on Induced Lateral and Vertical Prism.  This assumes you have some other instructional material....the main  benefit of this is the ability to generate an infinite number of problems."

"391318075";"Basketball Playmaker";"The Basketball Playmaker is a revolutionary tool for coaches, scouts, press and fans . . . enabling basketball plays to be digitally created and saved for future reference.

Modeled after the ubiquitous coach's whiteboard, the Basketball Playmaker provides offense and defense avatars that can be dragged around the screen (the court) to simulate plays and formations.  As plays are designed, the system stores movement, passes and shots and the associated track lines.  At playback time  ""tracking lines"" can be optionally turned on and off in ""Play"" and ""Step"" Mode.

Plays can be saved and played back at any time (during a timeout, a practice or a bench conversation).  Snapshots of these plays can be made with a click of a button and the resulting ""photo"" can be emailed, printed and/or filed as needed.  

The Basketball Playmaker has hundreds of predefined formation combinations (i.e. 1-2-3 defense vs. post offense, or man to man vs. perimeter, etc.).  The court can be specified as anything from predefined Professional to International to College to High School to Middle School layouts.

Player avatars are represented with standard 1 through 5 nomenclatures; letters (PG, SG, SF, PF, C); uniform numbers or even player names.  In addition, the color of the player avatars as well as the court itself is totally in control of the user.

Designed to run without an active internet connection. E-Mail your plays when you get back to the office.

On iPad there is Shot Mapper functionality  . . . to track shots, misses and the running score. Useful for Assistant Coaches mapping shots; scouts preparing for an upcoming opponent; a parent helping a son or daughter; or a hard core fan engrossed in March Madness. 

Simply tap on an approximate court coordinate and select the shooter; specify a hit or miss; and whether the shooter was fouled while shooing. Made shot appear as a green basketball, missed as a red . . . with a user specified Uniform Number, Player Name or even a player photograph or avatar. 

History of shots can be toggled off and on and displayed in various subsets and combination of subsets; 
•All/None 
•Home Team Only 
•Away Team Only 
•Made Shots 
•Missed Shots 
•Individual Players 
•By Period 

A special foul shot screen track free throws and places them into the continuous running score. 

Games are save and can be recalled at anytime. All data is stored locally on the iPad with no need for a Wi-Fi or intent connection. 

Games can be replayed shot by shot (watch as the score changes shot to shot to shot). 

Game Recaps can be broken out by the parameters mentioned above and then 
•Printed
•E-Mailed as PDF or Image 
•Images can be save (incorporate in other apps) 
•And complete game statistical breakdown can be printed or emailed. 

Unlimited number of games, teams, athletes and shots are supported  with no add-on charges. 

The Basketball Playmaker is a serious tool for those that are serious about basketball.

IMPRESSIVE STORY FROM USER
""When my family began trying to share old family letters in the 1980’s, photocopying was the best option. Later, saving scans to CD’s was considered, as was scanning on a printer’s flatbed. Then a few years ago I learned of Tiny Scanner and have never looked back! Tiny scanner does an excellent job of scanning these many hundreds of letters quickly and efficiently—in any setting! Its portability (on my phone) is high on my list of recommendations. Over the few years I have used it, Tiny Scanner has continued to improve its features and make scanning even more convenient. It has made my job of scanning and saving to Google Drive infinitely easier, and for that I much appreciate it.""

The game is divided into 16 exercises, each containing a series of images and a description of a character.
At the bottom left, the exercise number is indicated to keep track of where you are in the app.

HOW TO PLAY
The exercise presents sixteen drawings of sixteen descriptions of the small fish that inhabit Grandpa’s funny aquarium. Each text scrolls horizontally across the screen alongside the sixteen drawings. The fish which corresponds to the description must be identified. Once the fish is found, the water drop must be slid above it. If the answer is correct, a signal appears. Otherwise, the player passes on to the next text or the game has to be restarted. Once all sixteen drawings have been identified and each drop is in place, the game is complete.

"1546769347";"Handwriting Success";"Welcome to handwriting in the 21st century. 

Compatibility: iPad Pro 12.9"", iPad Pro 11"", iPad Air 10.9"" or iPad 10.2"". Requires iOS 8.0 or later, and the use of Apple Pencil or similar paired stylus with palm-rejection features. 

The Getty-Dubay® Handwriting Success App brings the popular Getty-Dubay® handwriting program in eight workbooks to your tablet and stylus. Each ebook is a complete program that you can write in, with pages and pages of instruction and practice. You’ll be able to use the worksheets over and over by digitally erasing your previous sessions — practice to your heart's content.

The Getty-Dubay® Handwriting Success App is simple to use. Turn pages, scroll, navigate and create bookmarks in the same way you would with an ebook. 

The fun comes when you touch your stylus to the screen. Now you can select the color, width and opacity of your pen line. Trace and copy the handwriting models, reading the instructions and tips as you go. Erase your work and practice more by selecting the eraser icon, or by erasing the entire page at once.

What’s new in this version: All nine Getty-Dubay® handwriting ebooks are now available via in-app purchase or subscription. Free samples allow you to try before you buy. There’s also an improved drawing engine, new screen rotation for smaller tablets and pinch-zoom. 

Teachers and parents, with the Getty-Dubay® Italic Handwriting Series ebooks you can now incorporate technology into your handwriting instruction with seven age-appropriate workbooks (Books A-G) and an Instruction Manual. Books A through G are available on this app as one-year subscriptions. 

Adults and professionals, with the WRITE NOW ebook you can learn to use your stylus with confidence and ease to produce notes that you feel good about sharing, and that your colleagues & friends (and your handwriting recognition software) can read.

This is not your grandparent's handwriting. For over 40 years, the authors Barbara Getty and Inga Dubay have been teaching people — from medical professionals to school children — how to have legible, handsome handwriting without the loops and curlicues of conventional looped cursive. Getty-Dubay® Italic is already enjoyed by tens of thousands of adults and students worldwide.

It's real handwriting, for real life.  

The App content takes you step-by-step through the printed italic alphabet (lowercase and capitals) and numerals, then onto joining these letters for flowing, legible cursive italic writing. And the books walk the talk: All are handwritten by the authors.

Students can take a screenshot of their work to send to their teacher.

This App replaces the need for the paperback workbook, which means you're saving paper and the resources that would have gone into producing and shipping the product.

While you may experience improved handwriting after just a few sessions, most gains will come from repeated practice over time. As you use this app, try out your new handwriting on whiteboards, or with pen and paper for thank you notes, other correspondence or school work.

It is designed for use with the videoconferencing application Zoom* to provide the cleanest ""shared screen"" input from your iPhone or iPad.

To use SecondCam with Zoom, install the Zoom desktop app (Mac or Windows) and follow the instructions on the Zoom support website:

https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Sharing-your-screen-iOS-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client

The SecondCam app can be used in either the ""via Cable"" or ""via AirPlay"" modes of Zoom screen sharing.

SecondCam Features:

• Camera's video feed is shown full-screen without a status bar or frame
• Can use either rear-facing or front-facing camera
• Video orientation can be locked to either portrait or landscape modes
• On-screen buttons for camera switch and orientation lock fade after 10 seconds, re-appear on touch
• Pinch to zoom camera image in and out
• Prevents your phone (and video) from going to sleep while running
• In-App Purchase ($0.99) lets you remove or change on-screen watermark text
• In-App Purchase ($1.99) to enable drawing on screen (with finger or Apple Pencil), over camera image or in whiteboard mode (requires iOS 13 or later)

Tech Note:

The Zoom desktop client (on Mac and Windows) includes functionality to capture your iPhone display and use it as a second screen during a videoconference.  As of this writing (late 2020), other videoconferencing apps - such as Webex and Google Meet - don't include this functionality, and so SecondCam will probably not work with them.  

The SecondCam app is free, so try it out and see if it works for you.  Any software that allows you to share your iPhone screen should work fine with SecondCam.

(The stand shown in the iPad screenshots is made by AboveTEK, with a special AboveTEK bracket for the 12.9"" iPad Pro.)

Teacher must have ***** by Amygrade1
I was looking for a great writing app to use with my class on the interactive whiteboard...this is it! So great! Finally a writing app with Victorian cursive. I will be recommending this to all the parents in my class for individual iPad use also.

A must have for every parent and teacher ***** by mrsnic123
Students just love this app. They love the different colour choices and the replay button. Definitely seen positive results with students with fine motor difficulties. Congratulations on a great app.

Must-Have for all schools ***** by Aunty_Vegemite
Brilliant app that is more than just a hand writing App. It can also be used in just about any curriculum area. Incredibly easy to make my own word lists with pictures and sounds. 

School Writing is a fully-customizable and feature-packed app that provides students with plenty of practice to perfect their writing of letters, words and numbers using their correct Australian State school font (and lines) on the iPad. Students intuitively trace pre-handwriting shapes, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, words or whiteboard images that you import with the touch of a finger. Hear and see letters, words and numbers with customised associated images and sounds. EduColouring is a plenty of fun, abc colouring activity that aids in developing hand, eye and finger coordination for very young learners.

For the older learners, School Writing allows the teacher or parent to create lessons using written instructions, unique images and audio instructions, to which the student can respond using written and audio recordings. This 'open scaffold' enables the lessons to be words, numbers or symbols and extends the use of School Writing far beyond early education. Completed lessons can be automatically emailed to the teacher or parent with the student’s tracings and recordings included.

With tracing accuracy turned to infants, easy, medium or hard, the students are rewarded with a half or full star depending on their accuracy. They are given three attempts before automatically advancing to the next letter or number. The default teacher tracings can be customised as can the images and sounds associated with each number and letter.

The ‘Whiteboard’ section allows a teacher to draw or import images, with unique audio instructions for tracing or interacting with. Students can trace and record audio answers. ‘Whiteboard’ is the pre handwriting activities.  
Create, save and share your own word lessons, student profiles and customisations to suit your curriculum, with complete control over the management of the lessons, the app and the student profiles. Full import and export functions are included for iPad classrooms including Airdrop file transfer, email, iTunes, dropbox or sending the lessons to the demografix website for public access.

The teacher or parent can lock the app into a restricted student mode. In student mode, word lessons cannot be created or deleted and profiles cannot be changed. Other options are available depending on your choices. Students have no access to the app settings when a teacher PIN is set. These include setting no student access to the app settings or any access to any external links.

"1490957862";"Baseball Force Out Teacher";"How many times have you observed this scene in a youth baseball or softball game?

An infielder makes an amazing stop on a ground ball.  It's the highlight of the kid's budding career to date.  And then...NOOOOOO!!!  Why did you throw it to THAT base?  Or...why did you think you could just step on THAT base??!  We've been over this in practice!

Fundamentals are crucial to understanding and playing baseball or softball.  Chief among them: where are the force outs?  Baseball Force Out Teacher is the perfect at-home supplement to any player or watcher's education.  

The eight different baserunner scenarios are randomly presented, and this fun game-like app drills home the correct answers to one crucial question: Where are the force outs?  Simply play it over and over until force outs are second nature!  

Plus, if you're a coach looking to freestyle or elaborate on infield scenarios, the app has a handy whiteboard feature."

PEN­CIL SUP­PORT
If you’ve got an iPad Pro and Apple Pen­cil, drawing feels especially great in Scrib­ble. It’s like us­ing pa­per, but you can draw with any­one, any­where in the world. You can also use Settings to decide what you’d like your finger to do while you have the Pencil in hand. 

NEAT SHAPES, STRAIGHT LINES
Can’t draw in a straight line? Neither can we! Scribble helps you draw perfect lines and shapes. Draw and pause without lifting your marker: you’ll see your shape pop magically into a rectangle, circle, ellipse, parallelogram, trapezoid, triangle or straight line.

"1515109130";"Grapic: pen and paper online";"Grapic is the iPhone app that lets you use real pen, paper, and whiteboards with your remote colleagues, clients, and friends. 

If your prefer sketching on a scrap of paper to get your point across, but find yourself in remote meetings, Grapic was made for you!

Grapic uses augmented reality and image processing to keep things steady and straight so you can focus on what you're writing. It's like screen sharing your paper!

COLLABORATE ONLINE WITH PEN AND PAPER

Nothing beats the real thing. Tactile, direct and real time.
Now also remote.

Use real pen and paper, sticky notes, and whiteboards, live with your remote colleagues and clients:

- Agile meetings: daily standup, sprint planning, retrospective
- Problem solving: brainstorm, mind map, diagram, graphs
- Explain new concepts: draw by hand as you explain
- Design: mockups, wireframes, architecture
- Sketch remotely with clients: great for architects, technical sales, UX, and many more

All you need is your phone and something to scribble or draw on. Explain everything like you were in the same room together.

HOW IT WORKS

Use the Grapic app to share a video stream of your notebook or whiteboard to your remote colleagues. No need for a camera tripod or expensive equipment - our augmented reality and computer vision tech keeps the video steady so you can focus on what you're drawing.

1) Draw when inspiration hits - Scribble directly in your favorite notebook or on the back of a napkin. Use the Grapic app to share your process in real time, with minimal setup. Just select the area you want to share, and start doodling.

2) Keep technology out of the way - Grapic uses fancy augmented reality and image processing so you can hold your phone where you like, and not think about keeping it steady. Put your phone down when you’re not drawing, and pick it up again to continue.

3) Share your page with colleagues - Invite your colleagues to view your paper or whiteboard in real-time by sharing a link to the session. When inspiration hits, they can join in and start drawing too.

4) Take snapshots of your best sketches so you can continue your discussion without loosing where you were. Snapshots you take while in a live session are shared instantly.

LIVE STREAM SHARING
Supports up to 10 presenting and/or viewing devices in the same session.

"1532752926";"MiHealTeam - Healthcare Staff";"MiHealTeam: manage patient care from your smartphone as a patient. MiHealTeam app replaces the traditional whiteboard in a hospital setting, allows call bells to be sent to nursing staff from your smartphone, collects ratings/feedback from patients, and provides updates about patient care to healthcare staff and patients. 

MiHealTeam can be used as a way to communicate in the hospital without face to face interaction to inform patients and/or patient advocates about patients. Patients can use the app to send call bells to nurses, receive announcements from physicians, and share their status with advocates of their choice. MiHealTeam improves communication speed and consistency between healthcare staff and patients. Designed to raise the quality of the hospital patient’s experience by keeping them engaged in their care through the app. Patient engagement is achieved in the MiHealTeam app by giving documentation of vitals in real-time, ability to access their care plan, requesting assistance from nursing staff, viewing messages from physicians, an interactive discharge checklist, and prompts for daily hospital and staff ratings. The patient has the option to share viewing privileges with family, health care proxy, or friends by texting a link with an invite to create an advocate profile. Ratings are collected from patients on staff performance and the overall patient experience. MyHealTeam patient ratings are more granular and comprehensive than traditional HCAHPS scoring techniques.  

MiHealTeam replaces the traditional whiteboard. The healthcare professionals assigned to the patient are viewable in the “My Care Team” tile which is on the main dashboard of the app. In the “My Care Team” portion of the app, the patient's care team is shown with the staff members' name, title, and high-resolution photo. 

The medical updates from the healthcare team are logged in the patient app. Patient profiles can be easily shared with a family member by sending them a link via text message which designates them as a healthcare advocate.

MiHealTeam improves the quality of the patient’s hospital experience by storing medical updates and informing the patient and nursing staff of physician rounds through a broadcast function within the dashboard. 

Patient ratings are collected and generated in a comprehensive approach. This gives a report that is generated daily and more granular than conventional HCAHPS scoring methods. These scores and ratings help hospitals to maintain excellent quality of patient experiences to maintain and improve satisfaction among hospital patients. 

If the patient chooses to share their profile by texting a link to a family member, designated proxy, or friend the new user will be prompted to create an advocate profile. From the advocate profile, the patient’s documentation of care can be viewed and monitored. Monitoring patient care as an advocate can be used to help manage patients' precautions, or because of geographical or financial restraints that prevent physical presence by the advocate.

Nursing staff can communicate with patients through the MiHealTeam app. Virtual communication allows nurses to respond to patients, immediately, appropriately, and without unnecessary personnel disturbing the patient during convalescence.

Founded by physicians, for physicians in an effort to increase the quality of patient care, healthcare teamwork, and patient satisfaction. Backed by CEOs that strive for innovation, and excellence."

"1434295595";"FrontShot";"A straight frontal view of the plane can be seen in real-time, even if the camera is pointed from an oblique direction. Operation is simple, and you can see a straight frontal view of any plane, such as a document or wall.

[Background of FrontShot development]
There are times when you want to shoot a straight frontal view of an object such as a document, wall, poster, or time-table. In cases like this, it is convenient if you can just point your camera from an oblique direction, and see the straight frontal view. FrontShot was developed to make this possible. Even if you point your camera from an oblique direction, any sort of plane --documents, walls, etc.-- can be viewed as a straight frontal image.

[Features]
Has three modes: horizontal plane, vertical plane, and slanted plane.

- Can handle any plane
The app can handle not only horizontal and vertical planes, but also slanted planes, and thus it is possible to see a straight frontal view of any plane. Naturally, it is also possible to see straight frontal views of ceilings. (Ceilings are regarded as horizontal planes.)

- Simple operation
Operation is extremely simple. For a horizontal plane, no special operation is necessary. Simply point the camera, and the straight frontal image will appear. For a vertical or slanted plane, the orientation of the plane must be designated (automatically or manually), but if the mode is set to automatic, a straight frontal image will appear just by pointing the camera, as with a horizontal plane. Operation is simple in manual mode too. Just point the camera in the direction of the plane, and press the button. A straight frontal image of the plane will appear.

*In the automated mode for vertical and slanted planes, the system calculates the direction of the plane by recognizing the horizontal and vertical lines which appear.

- Numerous convenient functions
Numerous convenient functions are provided such as tilt correction and document mode.

- Display in real-time
Processing is performed at high speed using our unique technology, and this makes it possible to display straight frontal images in real-time. 

[Uses]
The app can be used for a variety purposes including: documents, posters, whiteboards, time-tables, buildings, signs, pictures, lettering and pictures drawn on the ground, and online sale items (clothes, books, CDs, other flat items).

[Use instructions]
There is a ""How to use FrontShot"" item in the menu of the application, so please see there for details. 

(Others)
* Also, elimination of shifting distortion is supported.
* Only flat planes can be converted into a straight frontal view. The app cannot convert curved planes.
* This app is the free version. It does not allow saving or sending. Also, watermarks and ads are displayed. If you wish to save, send and hide watermarks and Ads, purchase the product version via in-app purchase.

"480510692";"Meetings - Notebooks for Work - Meeting Notes, Agendas, and Minutes";"Meetings helps you create structured meeting notes that are consistent, clear, and fully searchable.  Note who was there, what was said, and what needs to happen next.  Imagine holding a record of key decisions over the past year in your hand.

RECORD, RETAIN, AND RECALL

Give your meeting notes a title, adjust the date and time, add attendees, and create action items. You can pick the things you need for each document you create. Everything is searchable so you can later find meetings that mention 'deliverables' or 'hiring' or just those that 'Emma Avery' attended.

Capture whiteboard or presentation images within the app, or add your own from the photo picker.

HE SAID, SHE SAID

Add attendees from your address book.  While typing notes you can access and insert attendee names directly into the document with a tap.

NEXT STEPS

You can create a list of action items so you'll know what needs to happen before the next meeting.  If you need to, add a due date or notes to each task.  You can also assign an attendee (or someone else) to the action item so that you'll remember who's responsible.

NOTEBOOKS FOR WORK

Your notes are written in notebooks that you can rename and reorder.  This makes creating a notebook for each project, client, department, or key issues easy.

SHARE WITH THE TEAM

Email or print a copy of your notes.  There's a button to send-to-all-attendees if you need it.  Draft an agenda, add attendees, and email it to them prior to the meeting.  Afterward, you can send everyone a copy of the meeting minutes and action items.

You can also create a Calendar event for the meeting from within the app.

SIMPLE BY DEFAULT

A new meeting document starts with a title and your notes.  Show or hide content sections as you need.  If all you want is notes, hide the title.  If you need to add attendees or a section with tasks you can.

MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION

Maybe it's your job to take detailed notes, or maybe you're organized.  Having a record to refer to and send out will help you get the recognition you deserve.

WASTE LESS TIME

Structured notes help you focus on key decisions and actionable next steps.  If you find it difficult to distill a meeting into anything of substance you'll at least be able to make helping the team do better next time a goal.


FEATURES

* Multiple notebooks to keep notes organized

"317282434";"Baseball WhiteBoard";"Now updated for 64-bit devices and iOS7 (and newer)!

Baseball WhiteBoard is an application which allows you to display player and ball positioning as you would on a portable dry-erase baseball coach's white board.   It is a universal application that works on the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. 

Simply drag the players and ball around with your fingertips as you explain to a player how to position themselves on the field!  You can utilize pinch/zoom/scroll/rotate gestures and controls to focus on any area of the field you'd like (or leave it at a full-field display).  Teams can be represented by a wide variety of colors and you can have any number of players on each team on the field at any time. The letter designation on each player can be left at the default ""position"" numbers OR you can put a custom letter/number combination (as many as three characters on the iPad, two on other iOS devices) to represent a player's initials or their number.  You also have the option of displaying a label (such as the  player's name) underneath the circle.   Player positions, labels and designations can be saved for future recall.   You can also save team data separately for use with multiple white boards.   Originally released for the iPhone in summer of 2009, it is one of the original applications of its kind!  It's been totally re-written to take advantage of the latest and greatest features in iOS and to implement some of the great suggestions/feature requests received from users over the years!  Visit http://www.sandcrater.com for more information and to access the Baseball WhiteBoard user manual, support pages and responses to user feedback.

Need to draw lines on the white board? Activate one of the three drawing pens to draw different colored lines on the white board.   By default the pens are red, green and blue but you have the option of changing the color of any given pen.  To erase lines, simply use the erase control in the icon palette.   iPhone and iPod touch users can also give the device a good shake to clear the lines. 

Want to show where a player came from when moved? Turn on the ""trailing lines"" feature and a narrow line will be drawn along the path that each player is moved. This illustrates where the player ""came from"" before that player reached their current position. 

Configuring Baseball WhiteBoard is as easy as double tapping anywhere on the field (for iPhone and iPod touch users) or simply using the on screen controls to the side of the field (for iPad users). The controls area is where you set the number of players on the field, team colors, the trailing lines function and is where you go to save the current whiteboard and load previously saved ones. 

Baseball WhiteBoard supports some of the latest features in iOS such as iCloud!   Team data and white board data can optionally be saved to iCloud allowing you to access them from any of your iOS devices.   The same data can be easily edited from both an iPad and an iPhone/iPod touch with ease and without loss of precision.   Other more recent iOS features such as support for retina displays, printing to AirPrint printers and utilizing screen mirroring through AirPlay are supported.

Baseball WhiteBoard allows you to use your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a tool to help teach players of any age. Younger players are drawn in to the high-tech solution and will not be as easily distracted when compared to using a traditional white/clip board. Not on the field? Use Baseball WhiteBoard to set up a scenario and then ask your players to move the dots to the right position! It can be used as a teaching tool both on and off the bench."

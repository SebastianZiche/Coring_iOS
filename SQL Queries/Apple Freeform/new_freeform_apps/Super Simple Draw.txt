Draw for a better world:
Super Simple Draw started as a way to reduce the use of papers because we believe that the current environmental degradation and the climate change are pressing issues that demand urgent actions. Now we took a step further: for every ~2000 lines you draw, we plant a tree through a partnership with Trees for the Future. More than ten thousand trees have been planted so far.

What's New

Version 3.6.0 (Jun 22, 2023)
    Do you ever struggle to color inside the lines? Well, guess what? We've got an update that's going to make it so much easier! Now, the canvas has not one, but two layers! It's like having a secret superpower for your artwork. You can draw the outline on the top layer and color on the bottom layer, and the colors will never cover the outline.

    There are other creative ways to use these two layers. Imagine drawing something sneaky on the bottom layer and then surprising everyone by covering it up with a fantastic creation on the top layer. And when you want to reveal the hidden masterpiece, just erase the top layer and let the magic unfold. You can also make it a guessing game.

    Oh, and speaking of erasers, we've made a small improvement. In the past, it would just cover things up with white color, but now it's a true eraser that actually removes the drawings. When you export your image with a transparent background, the erased area becomes transparent too! No more dull white spots messing up your artwork.

    Other updates in recent versions:
    - Some Apple Pencil compatibility fixes for iPadOS 16.

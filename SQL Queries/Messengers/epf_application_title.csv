1138402830;Messenger Ping Pong 2016 : NEW Table Tennis;"Ping Pong or table tennis, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using a small paddle. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: Players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. Points are scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage. When doing so the hitter has a better chance of scoring if the spin is successful.

This is the next game in my series sport games ( Basketball Messenger 2016, Soccer Messenger Euro 2016, Messenger Archery 2016 and Messenger Ping Pong ).

I love Ping Pong. To be honest this is my most favorite sport.

How about you?
Do you know the Ping Pong song ?"

- Secure file sharing with encrypted data while managing projects
- Group Video chat with voice over IP and screen sharing

Element is different from other messaging and collaboration apps. It operates on Matrix, an open network for secure and decentralized communication. It allows self-hosting to give users maximum ownership and control of their data and messages.

Privacy and encrypted messaging:
Element protects you from unwanted ads, data mining and walled gardens. It also secures all your data, one-to-one video chats and voice communication through end-to-end encryption and cross-signed device verification. 

Element gives you control over your privacy while allowing you to communicate securely with anyone on the Matrix network, or other business collaboration tools by integrating with productivity apps such as Slack.

Element can be self-hosted:
To allow more control of your sensitive data and conversations, Element can be self-hosted or you can choose any Matrix-based host - the standard for open source, decentralized communication. Element gives you privacy, security compliance and integration flexibility.

Own your data:
You decide where to keep your data and messages. Without the risk of data mining or access from third parties.

Element puts you in control in different ways:
1. Get a free account on the matrix.org public server hosted by the Matrix developers, or choose from thousands of public servers hosted by volunteers
2. Self-host your account by running a server on your own IT infrastructure
3. Sign up for an account on a custom server by simply subscribing to the Element Matrix Services hosting platform

Open messaging and collaboration:
You can chat with anyone on the Matrix network, whether they’re using Element, another Matrix app or even if they are using a different messaging app.

Super secure:
Real end-to-end encryption (only those in the conversation can decrypt messages), and cross-signed device verification.

Complete communication and integration: 
Messaging, voice and video calls, file sharing, screen sharing and a whole bunch of integrations, bots and widgets. Build rooms, communities, stay in touch and get things done.

Pick up where you left off:

- You select Sent Messages and Create Message, write your message subject and text as you would a normal email/sms, select your friend as the recipient (by long clicking/pressing on his/her name in the Out list to move it to the In list). Press Encrypt and then Send. ChatS will encrypt the message and send it to the MoonC.mobi server.
- Your friend selects his/hers Received Messages, presses Refresh and his/her ChatS will check MoonC.mobi for new messages, download the message from you, decrypt it and when selected display the original text.

Zunächst wurde ein App-Editor (App-Baukasten) entwickelt und ab 2014 zusätzlich ein In-App Messagingsystem für Firmen erstellt – bekannt unter der Marke „CompanyMessenger“. Im Gesellschafterkreis der APPbyYOU befinden sich drei mittelständische, deutsche Firmen. Es wurde auf Kontinuität und Stabilität des Startups geachtet, die die Familienunternehmen vermitteln. Die Technologie ist nun eine Messaging-as-a-Platform (MaaP), d.h. nicht nur Messaging, sondern auch Integrationsplattform, die bestehende Programme, Widgets mit in die App auf dem „digitalen Workplace“ mit integrieren können. Erprobt wurde die Technologie in den letzten 2 Jahren bei industriellen Kunden als CompanyMessenger, dabei wurden auch u.a. Chatbots und Mensch-Maschinen-Kommunikationsszenarien abgebildet.

941161683;Chiffry Secure Messenger;"Chiffry ist die erste Kommunikations-App mit dem Qualitätszeichen „IT Security made in Germany“. Dieser verschlüsselter Messenger ermöglicht Ihnen Text- und Sprachnachrichten sicher zu versenden, Bilder, Videos, Kontakte und Standorte vertraulich zu teilen und zusätzlich abhörsicher zu telefonieren.


MODERNSTE SICHERHEITSFUNKTIONEN

Bei der Verschlüsselung orientiert sich Chiffry an den BSI-Richtlinien und setzt auf modernste Ende-zu-Ende Verschlüsselung mit 256-Bit AES im GCM-Modus. Dabei werden alle Nachrichten und Telefonate auf dem Gerät des Absenders verschlüsselt und auf dem Gerät des Empfängers entschlüsselt. Der Verschlüsselungsschlüssel wird vor jeder Nachricht oder Telefonat neu erzeugt und nach dem Briefkasten-Prinzip unter Verwendung der modernen Elliptischen-Kurven-Kryptografie (512-Bit ECDH) an dem Empfänger übermittelt. Zusätzlich werden alle Nachrichten mit Signaturen 512-Bit ECDSA fälschungssicher und jeder Benutzer dank Chiffry-Zertifikate identifiziert. Zum Vergleich: Online-Banken verwenden i.d.R. eine 2.048 bis 4.096-Bit RSA-Verschlüsselung. Die bei Chiffry eingesetzte Verschlüsselung 512-Bit EC entspricht 15.500-Bit RSA-Verschlüsselung. Der Aufwand, um diesen Schlüssel zu erraten, ist mindestens 3,4*1038 Mal höher. (Quellen: BSI TR-02102-1, TR-03111)


SICHERE DATENÜBERTRAGUNG

Der Datenschutz wird bei Chiffry in den Fokus gestellt. Die Datenübertragung erfolgt über den Chiffry-Kommunikationsserver. Dieser befindet sich im Hochleistungsrechenzentrum von envia TEL, welches zu den Sichersten in Deutschland gehört sowie höchste Anforderungen an Sicherheit, Anbindung und Verfügbarkeit erfüllt und nach IT-Sicherheitsstandard ISO 27001 & Managementstandard ISO 9001 zertifiziert ist. Auf dem Chiffry-Server werden bei der Registrierung ausschließlich nur Telefonnummer und öffentliche Schlüssel zur Kommunikation erfasst. Alle Nachrichten verbleiben im verschlüsselten Zustand auf dem Server, bis diese dem Empfänger zugestellt sind und werden nach der Zustellung oder spätestens nach 21 Tagen gelöscht. Durch die Ende-Zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung können weder Chiffry-Mitarbeiter noch Dritte auf den Inhalt dieser Nachrichten zugreifen, da sich der Verschlüsselungsschlüssel nur beim Absender und Empfänger befindet, um Informationen zu verschlüsseln und zu entschlüsseln.


EIGENSCHAFTEN DER BASISVERSION:

- Abhörsicher verschlüsselt telefonieren
- Sprach- und Kurznachrichten vertraulich versenden
- Bilder, Videos, Kontakte sowie Standorte vertraulich  teilen
- Verschlüsselte Nachrichten und Notizen versenden
- Verschlüsselter Chat und Gruppenchat mit bis zu 10 Mitgliedern

794864161;eMessenger;"Description:

SARA’s eMessenger Mobile is an advanced alerting capability of Status Solutions’ Situational Awareness and Response Assistant (SARA), an automated alerting engine that provides integrated alarm monitoring, alerting/mass notification and reporting. SARA’s eMessenger Mobile turns Apple iPhone and iPad devices into mobile command and control centers for emergency alerting and response management. 
All life safety, security and environmental controls within a facility can be integrated with SARA for a single point of alarm management and therefore complete situational awareness. And with situational awareness comes the ability to deliver information about potential threats in real time to virtually any communication device – especially mobile ones equipped with SARA’s eMessenger Mobile – for faster, more efficient response, especially in an emergency.
Organizations can retire obsolete communication technologies, such as pagers, and expand their use of mobile devices for greater flexibility and situational awareness in the palms of users’ hands. Responders then can deal with an unfolding event more quickly, initiate alerts and associated response plans more effectively, and escalate/notify others as necessary – all from one interface. Therefore, SARA’s eMessenger Mobile is critical to and unique in risk management because it:
+Turns mobile devices into command and control centers with intuitive dashboards for situational awareness and response management
+Delivers color-coded alerts from disparate alarm systems across a single facility, multi-building campus or large enterprise
+Allows users to receive and initiate detailed alerts, including the nature of an alarm plus location data 
+Escalates alerting and response management by enabling key individuals or select groups of responders to be notified in a single touch
+Provides approximate location data so clinicians and staff can locate an alarm source more quickly

Command and control on the go and the ability to read, hear, see, do and then analyze information for real-time situational awareness is what SARA’s eMessenger Mobile makes possible for any organization."

1055325837;Many Local Messenger;"Ik zoek hulp in de buurt! Ik help in de buurt!
In Many komen hulpvragen, helpers en mooie initiatieven bij elkaar.

Heb je hulp nodig bij het doen van boodschappen, met het uitlaten van de hond, heb je behoefte aan een maaltijd, of deel je juist voedselpakketten uit? Plaats je bericht dan in Many. Zo kan iedereen die de Many-app gebruikt en in de buurt is, fysiek of virtueel, jouw bericht lezen en hierop reageren.

Many geeft op deze manier een overzicht van hulpbehoevenden en hulpgevers in je buurt.
Tegelijk kun je ook ontdekken wat er in andere buurten leeft door met je vinger op het kaartje te tikken of een adres in de zoekbalk in te vullen.

Je kunt berichten plaatsen:
- in je directe omgeving (standaard ingesteld);
- op een plek die je zelf kiest;
- die met je mee verplaatsen: waar je telefoon is, is je bericht.

De berichten die je plaatst kun je aanpassen op:
- bereik/afstand;
- tijd;
- categorie.

Berichten die je leest of plaatst in een ‘Kanaal’ zijn alleen binnen datzelfde kanaal zichtbaar.

Er zijn drie soorten kanalen:
- het Many hoofdkanaal (standaard);
- kanalen gecreëerd door gebruikers;
- kanalen van organisaties.

Belangrijk! Gebruikersgegevens worden niet met derden gedeeld voor commerciële doeleinden en louter gebruikt om de Many-app te optimaliseren."

Our co-parenting app, Divvito Messenger, combines the best of email and messaging in one secure and convenient place. It’s easy to share information, including photos and files, and Juvo, your very own personal messaging assistant, is there to help keep communication organized, on track and positive.

Choose either our FREE version or upgrade to ENHANCED to completely customize your communication preferences.

WHY USE DIVVITO MESSENGER?:

PERMANENT: Your entire chat history is archived, offering peace of mind that you can easily refer back to conversations in the future. With the Enhanced version, download your message history in seconds for easy reference or to share with your lawyer or mediator.

Juvo will be there to assist, and to also let your co-parent know when features have been enabled.

POSITIVE: With the Enhanced version, Juvo tries to ensure your communication stays as positive and child-focused as possible, and you don’t send a message in the heat of the moment that you’ll regret later. Juvo privately scans each message before sending and suggests to revise it isn’t very appropriate. Of course Juvo is still learning, so you can flag any messages you received that you believe were inappropriate.

EASY LOGIN: Login with your Facebook or Google account or sign up using your email. Rest assured no information is shared with Facebook or Google. They only verify your password so you don’t have to create another with us.

COST-EFFECTIVE: Divvito Messenger is free to use, but if you want more control over your communication, you can upgrade to our Enhanced version for as little as $8/month per couple.

1101544587;Divine Messengers;"“Divine Messengers” is a software application that synthesizes the spiritual and voluntary work undertaken by the Association Mary, Mother of the Divine Conception.

For eight years our group has been receiving valuable instructions from the three Sacred Hearts: Christ Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Joseph. Their Messages are received by means of the visionary monks of the Grace Mercy Order, an autonomous institution, of a religious, philosophic, and ecumenical character, and of consecrated life.

These instructions that were born as an impulse of elevation for all of humanity were initially organized in our websites http://www.divinamadre.org and www.mercymarytv.org. Now, a new way of sharing this instruction is available: the application “Divine Messengers”, that was developed for cellular phones and tablets.

Today our group receives and divulges the Messages of the three Divine Messengers through the “Prayer Meetings” that are transmitted live to the whole world. Such events are free of charge, ecumenical, and accessible to all. All of the material is recorded, published and shared through different means.

With this app you will be able to:
• Access the last requests of the Divine Messengers to humanity;
• Receive notifications in order to always stay up to date;
• Obtain detailed information of each event, add it to your personal calendar, and share this information with all of your contacts;
• Read, add and share the latest messages of the three Sacred Hearts: Christ Jesus, Virgin Mary, and Saint Joseph;
• Attend the Prayer Meetings live via Mercy Mary TV® directly from your cell or tablet. You will be able to select the video quality (according to the available Internet speed) and, if necessary, listen solely to the audio of the transmission. You will receive a notification for each day of transmission and will be able to access directly with a single click;
• Access our official Facebook pages;
• Listen to, share and keep our songs in you cell phone (including the lyrics);
• Read and share the latest prayers and spiritual exercises received from the Divine Messengers;
• Bookmark relevant content as favorite;
• Access the institutional information about our work;
• Submit inquiries and suggestions among other messages.

The development of this proposal is the result of the loving and voluntary work of the collaborators of the Association Mary, as a permanent demonstration of their commitment with the Divine Plan.

The Divine Messengers application is fast, secure and free, and will allow you to keep, in a simple way, your permanent contact with God."

In addition to that, stickers are automatically combined with the text you type turning simple chatting into a fully visualized messaging.

Let's look into that in more details, shall we?

** Selfie-based **
First of all, it uses your portrait picture (just one) to generate dozens of personalized stickers various in design and layout. So you get many sets of unique images with YOU on them.

** Feelings on **
Emolfi Keyboard's next goal is to help you convey both aspects of your message - words and how you feel about them. To turn the feelings on six AI-generated emotions are added automatically to your selfie making it more versatile.

** Works with all languages **
Keep it simple and just type anything in any language keyboard. Then leave the rest to Emolfi Keyboard. It'll take care of getting you a 2-in-1: balanced visualization of words and feelings packed in one sticker-message.

** Always at hand **
It's a keyboard extension, so once enabled it can be reached within any app you want, just like emojis. Messengers and chats, social networks, browsers - you can easily control the list of apps in the app's settings.

**Easy export to WhatsApp**
A cool bonus for WhatsApp fans - up to 30 stickers can be turned into a native sticker set we all love so much.

**Non-distraction technology**
Appears only where needed. For those who prefer tapping the globe to switch among keyboards Emolfi Keyboard only appears by default in messengers and social networks and will be silently skipped in any other application (like browsers, gmail, etc.). It can be changed in settings.

Now you know everything, we are looking forward to seeing how you would you say Hi! in your favorite messenger now!

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

Then get your Protonet Messenger now and use all the important functions of our software SOUL OS, any place and any time via your smartphone. Send messages, photos, or share your location, while your data is still completely safe on your personal server.


FUNCTIONS

Private chat and sharing of pictures

Send pictures, videos, and message remotely via your smartphone to all users on your Protonet server. Protonet SOUL OS automatically recognizes on which device you are currently active. If you are working on your laptop with SOUL OS, you will receive a message directly through the browser, if you are underway you receive a push message on your smartphone.

Location sharing

Share your location with specific users for as long as you wish. These selected users will receive a push notification, and via the integrated map (map from Open Street Maps), they are able to see what your exact location is and where you are moving to.


AND YOUR DATA?

All the data that you share via the app is secured with a strong SSL encryption, just like all the communication done through the Protonet server. Because of our custom made technology, the Protonet server can send the text output from one smartphone to another. And the best part about this is that Apple or Google do not get their hands on your data.


HOW DOES IT WORK?

Firstly, in order to make use of the Protonet Messenger you need a Protonet server. Either you own one or were invited onto one as a user or guest.

The rest is very simple:

1.	Download and install the app
2.	In the app enter the name of your Protonet server eg. carla.protonet.info
3.	Enter the same login data that you use when you login to your Protonet server.
4.	Spread the word of our new Protonet Messenger app.

Do you not have a Protonet Server yet?
Take control of your data and become independent!

This is how LINKCAST protects user privacy in the most effective way possible.

Encryption uses AES 256 bit for ECDHE and encoding for authentication and HMAC - 512 bit for hash.

1148739578;FlyLady Messenger;"FlyLady Messenger gives you the convenience of all the notifications, reminders, zones, habits, and daily focuses from the FLyLady sytem at your fingertips.  No more anxiety and procrastination from missing a message or mission. This App is the official FlyLady-certified Messenger App!

Dear Friends,
You have waited so patiently for our App.  Thank you. I want to tell you a little about its history.

I am a geek at heart.  So, in 1999, when I was establishing my routines and decluttering our home, I set up some simple reminders on my Palm Pilot.  It became my memory.  I had developed my Control Journal but I still needed to be reminded to look at it.

Every hour, a reminder would pop up on my Palm Pilot. Even if I didn't actually do that item right then,  it was in my head.  Repetition is good to help develop lifelong habits.

The reminders in our App can be checked off to give you a sense of accomplishment.  The best part is they are in your time zone.

Over the years, we have all developed a love-hate relationship with email.  I have always believed that our messages helped to replace the negative thoughts in our heads.  We have to eliminate our stinkin' thinkin'! This sets us on the path to FLYing!
The FlyLady Messenger App is a mixture of our daily messages, testimonials, and reminders.  I have been using it for several weeks.  Just today, I got the reminder that asked if I had eaten any lunch.  I almost laughed because I was sitting down to eat a sandwich.  I do believe that I am reprogramming myself again.

As I have told you for many years, I want you to delete our messages every day.  With the App, the reminders start fresh each morning and the messages are geared to have a shelf-life of 24 hours.  I designed the App this way to help you let them go.  Messages can be opened by sliding to the left and tapping “Read.”  This will take you to our website to read the message.  The Reminders can be double-tapped to check as “done” with a big purple check mark.  At midnight, they all go away without you having to do anything.

We have priced this App so that it is affordable for everyone.  Right now, it is only available for iPhone users. Thank you for your patience.  We still have our messages free in regular email if you do not want to buy our App.   We will NOT automatically renew for you because we do not keep your credit card information on file.  I hate it when this happens to me.  It is like getting stuck in the “Record of the Month Club.”  Remember those?!  I will not do that to my FlyBabies.

Use the App!  Have fun with it.  Let it help you to FLY!

Love you,
FlyLady

FlyLady Messenger is only available for iPhone, IPad and iPod Touch running iOS 8.0 and up."

889904498;twinme private messenger;"twinme is a free  secure instant messaging and High-Definition voice/video call application, protecting your privacy and giving you full control over each of your relationships and contents.

WHY USE TWINME:

. PRIVACY BY DESIGN: twinme doesn’t ask, store, or use any of your personal data. You do not need to subscribe and provide any personal information to use twinme.
twinme is about the only messaging app that does not use your phone number (no email address or social network ID either), and that does not snoop into your address book to suck your contacts’ phone number and other private information.

. PERSONALIZED CONTACTS: you can choose what you disclose about yourself to each of your twinme contact individually: your name, your image, which you can change at any time. You control how each of your contacts can reach you (or not). Since your contact information is personal to each of your contacts, it cannot be transferred to nor used by anyone else. You are in full control, whether you interact with a close friend or a complete stranger.

. PERSONALIZED CALLS: twinme video calls allow your contact to see you in live video BEFORE accepting the call. You can thus create a live emotional preview of your call by simply long pressing the video call button.

. PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS: all conversations happen in peer-to-peer with no relay server storing contents in-between devices. Data exchanged always stay within devices. Messages and voice/video calls are end-to-end encrypted . You clear all messages of a conversation on both ends simultaneously in one tap.

. FAST MESSAGING AND HIGH DEFINITION VOICE/VIDEO CALLS: twinme peer-to-peer message transfers are instantaneous when both ends have an active data connection.
twinme voice and video calls leverage the latest state-of-the-art real-time multimedia protocols and codecs that adapt to device configurations and changing network conditions to provide the highest quality voice and video definition achievable on the market today.

. FREE WITH NO ADVERTISING: since twinme does not access any of yours or your contacts personal information, it cannot be used for commercial purposes. Unlike most other messaging apps, you are not a product.

. INTERACT ONLINE LIKE IN REAL LIFE: you are free to decide with whom, when and how you interact. 
Have one of your profiles’ invitation twincodes (QR-Code) scanned by a friend next to you or someone you just met, or send it by text, email or any other means to a family away, or post it to your website or tweet it to your followers: you decide.
If you don’t want to continue a relationship any further just remove it from your twinme contact list, and he/she cannot reach you anymore: no unsolicited call, no harassment, no spam are possible with twinme.

. IDEAL FOR KIDS: twinme helps you turn any tablet into a safe communication device for children. Without a phone number, your kid cannot discover or be discovered on line by unknown people. The only contacts allowed are those met in person (family and friends) that can flash the kid profile twincode (QR-code) with their device. Parents feel comfortable and kids can enjoy their first grownup social app safely.

. UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY: twinme extends the WebRTC open source technology (the new standard for secure real-time peer-to-peer multimedia exchanges on the web) with its unique twincode relationships model to provide the most disruptive communications services on the market today.

twinme uses your device Internet connection (WiFi or 3G/4G/LTE as available). Data charges may therefore apply. Check your carrier for details.

PERMISSIONS: 
. “Camera” & “Microphone” to take pictures, make voice/video calls 
. ""Photos"" for profiles and to send/receive photos in messages

What adds to the fun is that ScrollIt offers easy-to-type emoticons right from the same keyboard. Make your text even more fun to watch!

The phone vibrates quietly to let you know when the message has finished. (Replaced with a short beep on iPod Touch and iPad.)

App Description
Speak freely with Confide. With our encrypted messenger app, your mobile communications will be completely confidential and have the same level of privacy as the spoken word.

You’ll leave zero trace online with end-to-end encrypted messaging, vanishing messages, screenshot-proof technology, and Incognito Mode. You can even send retractable messages or use our line-by-line text reader.

Over 350 million encrypted messages have already been delivered safely and self-destructed with the help of Confide, while the patented ScreenshieldKit technology prevented more than 7.9K screenshot attempts.

Here's what you get with Confide:

ENCRYPTED MESSAGING
Send private texts and sensitive data with end-to-end encryption. (Your data is never saved on our servers.)

DISAPPEARING MESSAGES
Turn on Confidential Mode, and your messages will disappear after they’re read. Want to keep them for the day? Turn off Confidential Mode. Regardless, all messages will disappear automatically 24 hours after being sent.

VANISHING iMESSAGES
Confide’s highly-rated iMessage plugin does what no other technology can: erases your iMessages during any conversation. With Confide, you can compose and send self-destructive messages via iMessage.

SCREENSHOT PREVENTION
Confide’s patented technology ensures messages cannot be screenshotted by their recipients. Passports, credit cards, personal docs, and sensitive messages stay protected.

PRIVATE AND GROUP MESSAGING
Enjoy all of the privacy perks of this secret text app, like anonymous text, safe chat, and private texting – whether you’re 1-to-1 messaging or using group chat.

THREADED CONVERSATIONS
Add a layer of security to group texts. Quickly start a thread within the chat experience to keep the momentum going – without disrupting an ongoing group chat conversation.

INCOGNITO MODE
Stay anonymous. Unlike other encrypted messenger apps that announce when a new user has joined, Incognito Mode ensures you become undiscoverable to the people you don’t want to be seen by.

RETRACT UNREAD MESSAGES
Make private messaging even more private with the option to unsend unread messages. Change your mind? Retract!

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
* Create nicknames for your contacts
* Switch themes


AVAILABLE ON MOBILE AND DESKTOP
Use an anonymous chat, encrypted messaging, safe chat, private text, and Confide’s other features on the go or closer or on your computer.

Everyone deserves their privacy. Confide is perfect for professionals in the financial, political, journalism, and legal fields – because conversations are safe, and they don’t leave a paper trail.

The Confide app has been used by thousands of people around the globe and been featured by The New York Times, TechCrunch, and many more. Join the Confide community today!

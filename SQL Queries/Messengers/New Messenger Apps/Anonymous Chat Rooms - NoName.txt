App Description
Do you want to meet new people? Or maybe you're just bored and want to kill time? NoName is the chat app that you're looking for!

Our goal is to help you meet new people, no matter if it's to make new friends, search for your life partner, date online, or just have a few casual chats to kill time.

Others would have you pay a small fortune (or even a subscription!) just to have one or two good chats, but NoName is the first of its kind: you can send as many invites, messages, photos, and videos as you want!

NoName comes with some great features:
- 1-on-1 private chat rooms
- Group Chats with moderation tools
- Certified selfie system for real pics
- Safe blur to prevent unsolicited pictures
- Invite filters to prevent unsolicited requests
- Screenshot notifications for messages and photos
- Karma and popularity to naturally boost your profile
- Passcode protection with support for Touch ID and Face ID

Because we want everyone to have a safe experience, the following rules are actively enforced:
- You must be at least 18 years of age to use this app
- Profile pictures and usernames must be appropriate
- No self-promotion, no advertisement allowed

See you there!

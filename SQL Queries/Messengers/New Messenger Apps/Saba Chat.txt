App Description
SabaChat is a social platform for business and serious community builders. Providing advanced public and private group chat features and strong management capability for the community owners.

SabaChat users can invite their friends and other people via phone number or email and share exciting photos and videos. Our cloud is hosted on amazon AWS in US regions.

SabaChat users can create or join communities. When join community, the owner of the community will get notified and need to approve the member to join.

When creating communities, user could create from templates designed for different types of communities and bring the power of the instant messaging and social sharing into every aspect of your life.

The default community is for hobby or discussion like stock market. Your privacy is being taken care of, your personal information can be set hidden, and you can even have different names and profile photos in different communities. Only approved friend can send direct message to you.

You can create community for workspace, your team or your companies. In this type, everyone in the community sees each other and does collaboration easily. Everyone in the same workspace can message each other directly.

You can also create community for service. In this type, you can assign multiple representatives. After your clients join the community, they can only see the representatives, not other clients. This could be used for customer/service or communication with contractors.

User can send secrete and self destroying messages with anonymous identities where messages and photos are only available for 30 seconds after they are read. That is why we called the app after Saba, which is the name of a type of Japanese fish. It is said that fish has a short term memory. In the secret messaging, even the name of the sender is masked for more privacy protection.

App Description
Mate is an incredibly powerful translator app which is deeply integrated with iOS. It lets you easily translate words, texts and speech anywhere on your iPhone or iPad. It works both online and offline, as well as available in dark and light mode. Mate will have your back with 103 languages.

Mate is equally helpful if you're mastering a new language, want to take down a language barrier when going abroad, or just occasionally need to translate a web page, email, message, etc.

Full list of supported languages:
https://www.matetranslate.com/languages

Mate has some simple yet powerful iOS extensions which will save you a lot of time:

- Safari Extension. Browse the web without even noticing that there are foreign languages. Mate will translate websites before you even see them.

- Share Extension. Translate in Mail, Notes, PDFs by highlighting text, choosing Share and then Mate from Share Menu.

- iMessage App. Write messages in your language, Mate will translate them on the fly and send in the recipient's language. Or vice versa.

- Widget. Translate clipboard contents by long-pressing Mate's icon on home screen or from the Search screen.

We also supercharged Mate with some features language enthusiasts will totally love:

- Genders for nouns. Supports French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, and Dutch.

- Phonetic transcription and transliteration for both original and translation.

- Speak out.

- Phrasebook. It's an easy way to store vocabulary you want to learn. You can save words to Phrasebook directly or shuffle your existing translations to it.

If you're always on the go, we have something for you, too:

- Speech Translator.

- Mate Account. Mate has a powerful Mac app and extensions for all major browsers. Using Mate Account you can keep translation history and Phrasebook synchronized on all devices.

Mate is available for all of your devices:

    We built this version of Mate with the latest toolset available and made sure everything works perfectly on the new iOS 14.

Version 5.1.0 (Jan 29, 2020)
    Important! You should've already received an email from us which said that we're removing third-party login methods – Facebook and Google. Our decision is privacy and Mate's stability driven. Read more here: https://blog.gikken.co/were-removing-third-party-login-methods-from-mate/

    Help Center. We've created a help center where you can find answers to most questions, tutorials, etc. Check it out here: https://help.gikken.co/hc/

    Improved:
    - Full-page translation in Safari. We rewrote the website translation script. It should be faster, friendlier, and more stable now. Previously, it failed to work on some sites (e.g. Medium.com), now it works perfectly on every site.

    Fixed:
    - Hebrew full page translation works well again in Safari.
    - Issue with AirPods and other earphones was solved. Mate was speaking out via iPhone's loudspeaker even though the earphones were connected. Now it goes via earphones as intended.
    - iOS keyboard autocompletion is back in the main app.
    - Correct transliteration for Traditional Chinese.
    - A couple of light - dark mode bugs were squashed.
    - Copy button didn't work in the Safari extension, now it does.
    - Safari extension's bar could look ugly on some sites due to CSS confilcts, now it's better.
    - Speak-out for the original language didn't work in the Safari extension. We fixed it.
    - A nasty sync bug was fixed. Previously, when you signed out, then erased your History and/or Phrasebook, and then sign in again, it would erase it on the server, as well. Now, it won't. All actions that you do when you're signed out stay on your device.
Version 5.0.0 (Dec 4, 2019)
    It's the biggest update we've ever shipped for Mate's iOS app! Without kidding, it's even larger than the initial Mate release. It's packed with 5 totally new features and a few dozens of smaller improvements.

    Offline Mode

    Yes, you're reading it correctly! From now on, Mate can translate offline, too. Just download offline packs for languages you need from the language picker and you're good to go. Packs are reasonably-sized — each of them is just around 50 MB. Please note offline translation come without synonyms and phonetic transcription, though.

    Safari Extension

    We added yet another way to translate seamlessly within iOS — now in Safari. With our brand new action extension you can translate words, sentences and even full pages without leaving Safari. Turn on Mate Extension from the share menu in Safari's toolbar.

    Dark Mode

    It's better late than never, right? Mate offers both light and dark modes now.

    Smart Swap

    Mate will always try to understand the input language itself even if you forget to set it correctly.

    More Data About Words

    Now Mate shows phonetic transcription for the original, too. We also added support for genders for languages like French, German, Spanish, Italian, etc.

    All-New Speech Translator

    Mate's Speak & Translate feature was redesigned from the ground up. It's not a separate screen anymore. You can start talking to Mate by simply tapping on the microphone icon in the input field. Pretty much the same way as audio message in WhatsApp or Telegram work. The words will appear in the field on the fly.

    Updated Home Screen Quick Actions

    Long tap on Mate's icon on home screen to access our revamped quick actions. You can start speech or clipboard translation from there.

    Better Look on iPad

    We owe an apology to iPad users that Mate was a downright iPad-hostile app up until this moment. We optimized every screen and extension to look and feel natively on iPad.

    Speed and Stability Improvements

    Phonetic transcription should never fail to load, translation speed became considerably faster.

    Enhanced Copy Options

    You can copy phonetic transcription (or transliteration) too now. Just long tap on it.

    Bugs Fixed and Smaller Improvements

    - Mate won't interrupt your music playback when using the speak-out feature anymore.
    - We polished Mate's look on iPhone X, XR, Xs (Max), and 11.
    - We made the main screen cleaner and more solid.
    - We localized Mate into a bunch of new languages. We also polished old localizations. All in-app copy should've become more clear and concise.

    Mate is also available for Mac and as a browser extension for all major browsers:

    You will definitely find Mate useful in the upcoming year regardless if you are planning to go abroad (Mate speech translator won't let you be lost in translation) or start learning a new language (Mate Phrasebook will help you learning new words in a quick way).

    Also, we are now giving Mate Pro to all iOS users for free if you've been already using Mate for Mac. If you are, just sign in to the Mate account on your Mac and then to the same account on your iPhone/iPad, it will automatically activate Pro on your iOS device.

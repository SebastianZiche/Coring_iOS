App Description
Do you often travel abroad? If you do, we have a great assistant application for you: Triplens

Triplens is an application developed to improve your travel experiences. For instance, even if you speak very well the language of the country you are travelling in, you may encounter an unfamiliar object or may not remember its exact equivalent of that object in that foreign language. Triplens will help you a lot in such situations. All you need to do is to take a photo of an object whose meaning you don’t know after selecting the target language :)

Triplens is a wonderful assistant also for text translations. You can translate pages of texts into a target language just in seconds.

DISCOVER MORE:

- Object mode: Take a photo or upload one from your gallery. Triplens will recognize the object and translate it into any language you want. You can also listen to the pronunciation of the translation in the target language.

- Text mode: Take a photo of a document with pages or upload a photo from your gallery. Triplens will scan the text and translate it into any language you want.

DISCOVER TRIPLENS PREMIUM:

- The standard of Triplens will be sufficient for your trips abroad for a few days. And for your longer trips, you can remove limits with Triplens Premium!

We are offering in-app purchases for the premium version of Triplens and being subject to the selected plan, you might also be offered a free trial period. The cost will be charged to your iTunes account and it will vary from country to country. You will be able to see the fee amount before completing the purchase. Subscriptions with in-app purchases will be renewed according to the renewal scheme of the selected payment plan. To terminate automatic subscription renewal, you must deselect the automatic subscription renewal option at most 24 hours before your subscription expires. You can cancel your automatic subscription renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Where applicable, the privileges granted during the free trial period that have not been used will lose their validity at the time the user purchases a subscription of the related publication.

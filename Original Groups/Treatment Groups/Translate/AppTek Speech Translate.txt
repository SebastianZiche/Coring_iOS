App Description
AppTek Speech Translate is a real-time two-way speech communication application that enables you to speak a local language while traveling abroad or with native foreign-language speakers at home. The app offers complete speech-to-speech translation using the latest in automatic speech recognition, neural machine translation, and text-to-speech technologies. For a limited time, AppTek’s Speech Translate application is available at no cost.

Using AppTek Speech Translate, users can:
• Speak directly into their device and translate into Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese Mandarin, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Russian, or Spanish.
• Access 100 FREE pre-loaded offline phrases to help you in Emergency, Medical, Transportation, and Dining situations.
• Record phrases before traveling and save them as favorites to later access offline when you want to avoid cellular network usage charges.
• Type words or phrases into the tool for the text-to-speech or text-to-text translations in multiple languages.
• Edit translations easily by changing the text in your native language.
• Alter the gender of the speaking voice for a more natural-sounding response.

No matter your need, directions, local amenities, restaurants, and especially in case of an emergency, AppTek Speech Translate is the ideal travel companion.

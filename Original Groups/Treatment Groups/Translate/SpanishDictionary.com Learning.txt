    Introducing SpanishDictionary.com iOS app version 6.0! We have a shiny new look and feel that we hope you love as much as we do.

    Now you can easily navigate between our different language-learning features using the tab bar at the bottom of the screen. Toggle between dictionary entries, vocab quizzes, articles, and more!

    Swipe from the left edge of your screen anywhere on the app to return to the previous page you were on. Keep swiping back to look through your previous dictionary searches.

    Remember, you can always tap the icon in the tab bar again to return to the main page of that section. If you’re 10+ searches deep and don’t feel like swiping back 10+ times, just tap the icon and you’ll be immediately sent back home. Also, your settings and login can now be accessed through the profile avatar at the top left of the homepage.

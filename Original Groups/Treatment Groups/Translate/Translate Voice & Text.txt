The lower half of the screen displays the translation for one speaker, while the upper half is flipped to show the translation for the other speaker. This makes it easier than ever to have natural conversations with people who speak different languages.

    Phrasebook: Our new phrasebook feature allows you to save frequently used phrases for quick access, even when you're offline. You can create your own personalized phrasebook and easily access it anytime, anywhere.

    Bug fixes: We have fixed some minor bugs and improved the overall performance of the app, ensuring that you have a smooth and seamless translation experience.

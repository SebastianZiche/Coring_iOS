    - Improvements to Pronunciation sessions: instead of 'record and compare' we now analyse your recording and tell you if your pronunciation is right or needs more work. And you get to try 10 times, so you really nail them fast. The bonus round (after answering 10 tests) has clearer instructions and it's easier to use. Lip-sync along to native speaker videos and have a giggle!
Version 3.0.13 (Jul 24, 2019)

    * Well, we touched up a few things in the background but nothing that's obvious.

    * It's actually a bit boring and techy. Definitely not epic or mind-blowing.

    * So you may as well stop reading.

    * You're still reading.

    * Really, there's nothing to see here.

    * Ok, we'll be off then.

    * Bye.

Version 3.0.7 (Jun 6, 2019)

Version 3.0.6 (May 29, 2019)
    Nothing much going on here, we just had some bugs trying to move into our HQ. Really annoying.

Version 3.0.5 (May 16, 2019)
    New week, new updates, no Game of Thrones spoilers. Fixed:

    Today marks the start of a fresh new look for the app!

Don’t worry, everything still works the same, it’s just a new look. You can read more about it on our blog at blog.memrise.com. ¡Vamos!

    Once upon a time, there were three little bugs who lived in a far-away land called Memrise. One day, the bugs decided to build themselves a new house. The first little bug wanted to build the house out of straw, the second out of sticks, and the third out of bricks. But due to a tight budget and rising construction costs, they eventually agreed to build it out of straw. This proved to be a terrible choice, as one day, a big, bad dev came along. And she huffed. And she puffed. And she blew the house down, and gobbled all the bugs up in one big bite!

    Because we know you’re going to be spending a LOT more time inside now the weather’s started to get a bit more bleak, we’ve given the Memrise app a bit of a spring clean. Well, an autumn clean really. We’ve updated the app to make sure you won’t be bothered by bugs as you move into your Winter of Language Learning (NOT discontent).

Take pictures of different objects and they will be stored along with their translation and pronunciation! What are you waiting for? GO EXPLORE!!
Version 2.2.35 (Aug 29, 2017)
    Memrise: Let’s play a game
    You: ‘kay…?
    Memrise: We’re going to communicate with you in another language
    You: What? Like French? I’m getting pretty fluent in French now.
    Memrise: Nah.
    You: German? I did a bit of German at school
    Memrise: Nope.
    You: Do you want to give me a clue? I mean there are 25 languages to learn from on Memrise…
    Memrise: :ok_hand:
    You: Oh. I see. You want to communicate in emojis?
    Memrise: :thumbsup:
    You: Alright. Away you go...
    Memrise: :ant: :bug: :beetle: :arrow_right: :x:
    You: You’ve made some updates and stamped out some bugs?
    Memrise: :thumbsup: :black_square_button:
    :heavy_plus_sign: :video_game: :game_die: :black_square_button:
    You: And you’ve added more games?
    Memrise: :clap: :black_square_button:
    :woman: :school: :heavy_plus_sign: :computer: :arrow_right: :bulb:
    You: Ooooft. This one is tricky. Is it...erm...is it that your linguistics experts and the awesome technology you use are always improving means we’ll have the best learning experience possible?
    Memrise: That was a tough one. But you nailed it! OK. ONE MORE?
    You: ‘kay. Can we go pretty quickly though?
    Memrise: :thumbsup: :black_square_button:
    :pray: :family: :heart: :point_down: :koko:
    You: Does this one mean “Thank you. The Memrise Family love having you here?
    Memrise: YOU CRACKED IT. You’re so good at this game. 10 points to you!
    You: What do points get me?
    Memrise: erm. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. But it was fun right?
    You: …...well. Thanks for fixing the bugs, adding the new games and updating the technology anyway. I’m gonna go practice my French now.
    Memrise: AU REVOIR MA PETITE!
Version 2.2.34 (Aug 21, 2017)
    At first you were afraid,
    You were petrified
    Kept thinking you could never live without Memrise by your side,
    But then we spent oh so many nights
    Fixing all those pesky bugs and we grew strong,
    We learned how to get along

    And now we’re back, with missions to space
    And language learning lessons, tonnes of games are back in place
    We’ve updated both our apps
    We’ve filled in all the coding gaps
    So you can carry on your journey to language fluency

    Go on now go, go and learn French
    Or Arabic or Spanish*, just get off the language bench
    We’re here to help you unlock a world beyond your own
    You can do it
    When you’ve updated Memrise on your phooooooooooone

    After our update
    You will survive
    Oh as long as you’ve got Memrise
    You won’t be lost for words again
    Whether you go to Japan or whether you go to Finland
    You’ll survive - you will survive!

    Heeeeeeeeey HEY!

    * or any of the 25 languages we have courses in
    ** No soul singers were harmed in the creation of this update, despite some of the clumsy phrasing
Version 2.2.33 (Aug 14, 2017)
    There's a double whammy in this update: you can now score points in chats. That's right, you'll hone your conversations skills AND get points to keep climbing those leaderboards, all in one. Boom.

    Here's the lowdown:

    Get 45 points for each correct entry during a chat.
    Get 200 bonus points the first time you successfully complete a chat.
Version 2.2.31 (Jul 31, 2017)
    Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the intrepid language explorer. Your continuing mission is to explore strange new words, to seek out conversations in Foreign languages and to boldly go where 15 million other Memrise adventurers have gone before.

    We’ve had Mr Data and the team at The Enterprise make a couple of amendments to the app to ensure everything is running ship shape so you can continue on your language learning adventures at warp speed. Sadly, our linguistic experts are still in negotiations with the Klingons to bring their beautiful language to our platform. Until then, you can still try your hand at French, Spanish, German and other exciting Earth languages. We’ve heard rumours of a civilisation a few hundred lightyears away that speak Japanese…
Version 2.2.30 (Jul 25, 2017)
    Small, squishy alien WLTM language learners for LTR (or just a bit of casual fun). Must have GSOH and be ok with more than two eyes. Likes long walks on the beach, piña coladas, and getting caught in the rain. Strigiformes need not apply.

    We’ve overhauled our ranks. Bye bye memblah, hello Ziggy.
Version 2.2.29 (Jul 17, 2017)
    For those of you who experienced the momentary twilight zone where all learning content appeared to be locked, panic not. It’s fixed.
Version 2.2.28 (Jul 7, 2017)
    We’ve bugged the fixes and destabilised the improvements.
    Wait…what?
Version 2.2.27 (Jul 3, 2017)
    We’ve bugged the fixes and destabilised the improvements.
    Wait…what?
Version 2.2.26 (Jun 21, 2017)

    Wait…what?
Version 2.2.25 (Jun 16, 2017)
    We’ve bugged the fixes and destabilised the improvements.
    Wait…what?
Version 2.2.24 (Jun 7, 2017)
    We’ve bugged the fixes and destabilised the improvements.
    Wait…what?
Version 2.2.23 (Jun 5, 2017)
    NEW! Now you can learn the tricks of the grammar trade with a little help from Grammabot*, a Memrise bot trained by polyglots to help you understand the grammar of the language you’re learning.

    * Available in official Memrise courses of French, Italian, German, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese. More languages coming soon.
Version 2.2.22 (May 30, 2017)
    NEW! Now you can learn the tricks of the grammar trade with a little help from Grammabot*, a Memrise bot trained by polyglots to help you understand the grammar of the language you’re learning.

    * Available in official Memrise courses of French, Italian, German, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese. More languages coming soon.
Version 2.2.21 (May 22, 2017)
    Get your language learning superpowers on with our new Lifetime Pro subscription: sign up once, enjoy every new feature that’s added FOR-E-VER. Memrise Pro, for life.
Version 2.2.20 (May 15, 2017)
    Now this is a story all about how
    Memrise got fixed-turned upside down
    I'd like to take a minute
    Just sit right there
    I'll tell you about changes on this version we’ve shared

    In East London born and raised
    Teaching languages is where I spend most of my days
    Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool
    Testing some vocab outside of school
    When a couple of bugs who were up to no good
    Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
    I got in one little fight & my app got scared
    It said "You're updating so bugs & issues beware.
Version 2.2.19 (May 8, 2017)
    Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Memrise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new words, to seek out new languages and release new updates, to boldly remove bugs where bugs have gone before.
Version 2.2.17 (Apr 11, 2017)
    The Updates writer is off performing bug fixes and health improvements to themselves. We expect to see them back in full, bug-free operation next week.
Version 2.2.16 (Apr 3, 2017)
    Learn Mandarin Chinese with our Official courses that are now BIGGER, BETTER & STRONGER. Our language specialists have carefully selected thousands more words and phrases that will help you sound more like a 21st century human and less like 20th century translating machine.
Version 2.2.15 (Mar 27, 2017)
    This is Ground Control to Major Will
    You've really made the change
    And the papers want to know which fix is where
    Now it's time to leave the app-sule if you dare

    This is Major Will to Ground Control
    I'm releasing through the door
    And I'm updating in a most peculiar way
    And the bugs look very different today

    For here am I sitting in a tin can
    Far above the world
    Many bugs are through
    And there's nothing I can do
Version 2.2.14 (Mar 20, 2017)
    We have improved some bugs and stabilized a few general fixes.
    Wait…what?
Version 2.2.11 (Mar 6, 2017)
    GET ALL THE NEW STUFFS!
    WATCH ALL THE NEW VIDEOS IN MEET THE NATIVES MODE
    All British English official courses have tons of new videos
    In Korean official courses
    In Norwegian official courses
    In Swedish official courses
    In Spanish (from Spain) official courses
    In Italian official courses
Version 2.2.10 (Feb 27, 2017)
    GET ALL THE NEW STUFFS!
    WATCH ALL THE NEW VIDEOS IN MEET THE NATIVES MODE
    All British English official courses have tons of new videos
    In Korean official courses
    In Norwegian official courses
    In Swedish official courses
    In Spanish (from Spain) official courses
    In Italian official courses
Version 2.2.9 (Feb 20, 2017)
    We have improved some bugs and stabilised a few general fixes.
    Wait…what?
Version 2.2.8 (Feb 13, 2017)
    * UNLEASH LANDSCAPE MODE! That’s it guys, we did it! Landscape mode is now available for iPads everywhere. So emosh.
    * ¿Más videos? ¡Sí! There are tons of new Spanish videos for you to enjoy in Meet the Natives mode. (Remember, they’re only available in our Official Spanish from Spain courses)
    * Also, Danish Meet the Natives mode is making its debut in this update. SÅDAN!
Version 2.2.7 (Feb 6, 2017)
    Fixed: Some courses were displaying a needy ‘look-at-me’ behaviour, appearing in the list of courses you are learning when, in fact, you were not. We’ve put an end to that mischief.

    Learned: There is an auto repair shop in Poland that is still using a 1984 Commodore 64 computer to balance driveshafts. It’s even survived a flood!
Version 2.2.6 (Jan 30, 2017)
    Fixed: A few crashes that were happening in a region of code so deep in the app’s background, that it’s hard to imagine how it has anything to do with learning ‘potato’ in French.

    Wondered: When the first human is born on Mars, we’ll have to add ‘Planet of Birth’ to our passports.
Version 2.2.5 (Jan 23, 2017)
    Fix of the week: There was an unexpected heart shortage over at Speed Review, which caused you to lose all three hearts with just one wrong answer. We’ve now stocked the mode with a surplus of hearts and set a low supply alarm so this doesn’t happen again.
Version 2.2.4 (Jan 16, 2017)
    We’ve been doing the new year equivalent of hitting the gym and clean eating: our engineers have been exercising their fingers with fast-speed debugging sessions and making the app leaner and stronger with smaller but important improvements:

    - There was an issue with word boxes in difficult words overlapping with the tested word. Karate was used. Boxes are back in their place.
    - Your hard earned progress and points weren’t saving properly. Lame. But fixed.
    - There was a glutton bug eating up courses when you tried to download them, and that made the app crash. Squashed that one.
    - If you deleted all your courses, the app would get sad and confused, and crash repeatedly. After some therapy, it has come to grips with the reality of empty dashboards. No more crashes there.
    - Something happened in Missions that messed with Mission Control’s messages and replaced them with your answers. It was either evil spy agents, or our AI is becoming self-aware. In either case, we’ve put a stop to that nonsense.

    If you’ve read this far, the supermolecules of learning super powers will be with you all year long. No need to send it to 10 friends to avoid losing this good fortune. Happy 2017!
Version 2.2.3 (Dec 14, 2016)
    The Multiverse: a journey without frontiers. These are the voyages of the starship Memterprise. Its mission: to explore new Universes of language, to seek out new ways of life and new cultures, to boldly take you on an epic learning adventure unlike any you’ve known before.

    Basically, the sign up and log in screens are a whole new story. Literally. Go update!

    Have you seen any bugs from a parallel universe invading the app? Report it to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.2.2 (Nov 26, 2016)
    Good morning, Memriser.

    Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to install the latest update and navigate to:

    French 1, Spanish (Spain) 1, German 1, Italian 1, Portuguese (Brazil) 1, Russian 1 and Danish 1.

    In the dashboard you’ll find a new feature titled ‘First Contact’. It’s been designed to put your language skills into practice. If you manage to successfully complete this one, you’ll be cleared to partake in further missions.

    Report any technical difficulties to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.2.1 (Nov 21, 2016)
    Good morning, Memriser.

    Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to install the latest update and navigate to:

    French 1, Spanish (Spain) 1, German 1, Italian 1, Portuguese (Brazil) 1, Russian 1 and Danish 1.

    In the dashboard you’ll find a new feature titled ‘First Contact’. It’s been designed to put your language skills into practice. If you manage to successfully complete this one, you’ll be cleared to partake in further missions.

    Report any technical difficulties to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.2.0 (Nov 14, 2016)
    Nothing major to report, we’ve just been stabilising your navigation after some pesky stowaways were causing turbulence on board, We have regained control and thrown the bugs into the big black void of code, so it’s back to a smooth flight!

    Please, report any technical glitches you find in the app at ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.35 (Oct 31, 2016)
    The last *suspiciously* uneventful update turned out to be rather suspicious overall, causing havoc everywhere. Sparks and dust were flying after downloading the previous release and our developers’ brains almost burned in the process of trying to fix the crashing universe.

    The dust has settled. It should be all good now. Go and try it all out!

    Report any issues to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.34 (Oct 24, 2016)
    Ok so…this update is *suspiciously* uneventful. There’s classified memos going around, designers working behind closed doors and the engineers all turn their screens away when someone walks by. The only info they’ve made available is this:

    * The font in the Mode Selector bar now adapts to screen size so text is no longer truncated.
    * Speed Review needed 20 items to successfully populate a session, now only 3 items are needed.

    This is just so weird. Something…something is going on guuuuuys! I am now on a *mission* to find out what it is. Expect a report, but if you never hear from me again, please tell Chomsky the cat I love her.

    In the meantime, keep it secret. Keep it safe.

    And keep the bug reports coming this way: ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.33 (Oct 17, 2016)
    It’s been getting creepy around here…

    Mems suddenly all appearing in the wrong order.
    The app mysteriously closing when you tap on a course’s item list.
    The ‘pull to refresh’ icon and a scroll-down button not disappearing on command!

    [A spine-chilling shriek can be heard in the background - BREATHING INTENSIFIES]

    But fear not! Our bugbuster squad has already captured the paranormal code that was causing all the app-haunting listed above. It is now forever trapped in our ecto-containment system. Or…is it?

    If there’s something weird, and it don’t look good...who you gonna call? ios@memrise.com!
Version 2.1.32 (Oct 6, 2016)
    It’s the little things that make a difference:

    * The recently unveiled presentation screen has been pimped even MORE with fantabulous design and classy engineering.
    * Passwords are now free from the tyranny of character number! Well, almost. When you change your password, it still needs to be 6 chars long but it can now be a different length. Anyway, there was an evil line of code preventing you from freely changing it and we gave a cupcake to the dev that fixed it.
    * Bugs were sacrificed and offered to the Gods of Autumn, we’re hoping that in return they’ll abolish everything that is pumpkin-spiced.

    Please report any app errors to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.31 (Sep 28, 2016)
    The only new thing about this update is things *finally* going back to normal. The past week was a *little* weird all over the place: total number of words not being shown accurately, text layout was out of control and even pictures were acting up in presentation screens. The devs kept investigating, things kept misbehaving. It was emotional. But we made it, it’s over, everything is back in place. We’re blaming it on Mercury being in retrograde.

    To report bugs or send hugs: ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.30 (Sep 22, 2016)
    Ok so the next time you load a session to learn new words you’ll see a brand new presentation card. Presentation cards are important, man. Because like, when you see a new word and its meaning for the first time, it should glide into your mind like Michael Jackson’s shoes doing the Moonwalk. And the old cards were a bit more Austin Powers than King of Pop. But now that they’ve undergone a scientifically engineered makeover their brain appeal has been ramped up for maximum mind glide.

    Also, the Fall Bug Squishfest of 2016 is now underway. And speaking about Fall, you might want to peek into the Pro tab ;).

    Join the Squishfest by reporting bugs to ios@memrise.com

    A long time ago, in the Memrise HQ far, far away from anything central…

    Update 2.1.28
    The Attack of the Bugs (and some navigation improvements)

    There is unrest among the Elite iOS Knights.
    Several unresolved issues remain open
    hours before the new Update is up for review

    While the Tech Congress of Memrise
    debates how to resolve these events,
    the Supreme CTO has secretly dispatched
    his most trusted knights to the coding frontline

    Hoping to restore UI harmony and
    improve deep functionality, Captain Will
    leads the attack with a blockade of deadly
    bug killers and innovative development commands….

    bug fixes
Version 2.1.26 (Aug 24, 2016)
    You: *opens app*
    Memrise: Oh hi, here’s a word
    You: Yup, nice one
    Memrise: Here’s another word
    You: Ha, yeah ok
    Memrise: Pick the right word
    You: Piece-o-cake
    Memrise: Type this one out, then
    You: Pfff, eaaaaasy
    Your brain: …
    You: Come oooon we JUST saw it, it’s the one with the letter and the, ummm…
    Your brain: …
    You: C’mon brain, we got this!
    Your brain: 4 0 4
    Memrise: Pssst, dude, lookie over here
    You: Wot?
    Memrise: Looook, trust me, tap on this thingy right here *points at mysterious new button*
    You: What even… *taps thingy*
    Memrise: * P O O F *
    YOU: o.O
    Memrise: *F appears*
    You: O.o *tap tap tap*
    Memrise: * r * o * m *
    You: …
    Your brain: …age. fromage. FROMAGE!
    You: Holy…
    Memrise: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    Abra-cadabra, new feature. Update to check it out!

    We also got tricks to make bugs go poof, just report them to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.25 (Aug 17, 2016)
    Captain’s log, Stardate 2.1.25. We have traced a clearer navigation path between the interconnected Galaxies of Language that populate the Memriseverse. This should make it easier for humans to pinpoint their location in their target Galaxy as well as moving to the next or previous Galaxy, should they wish to alter the course of their mission at will. Engineering Officers from the Coding division have also expanded visual communications capabilities, granting humans with Pro status a FULL learning video experience, whereas before they were limited to reviewing. We expect to see an increase in their language superpowers as a result of finding themselves surrounded by videos of native creatures scattered all through their target Galaxy.

    Captain’s log, supplemental. We have beamed down extra satellites to orbit all level-planets in each Galaxy. Their purpose is to keep count of the Difficult items humans develop during their mission. Further improvements to navigation include hiding mnemonic devices behind a reveal button and locking access to higher-level planets until current-level planets have been conquered.
Version 2.1.24 (Aug 10, 2016)
    We put an update in
    We put an update out
    We put an update in
    And then shaked it all about
    It got all hokey pokey
    so we turned it all around
    That’s what it’s all about!

    Otherwise known as a “general fixes and improvements” update.

    Bugs? We squash ‘em. Rat them out to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.23 (Aug 4, 2016)
    * Did you know you can choose the number of words you want to learn in each session? If you didn’t know, now you know! Anyways, 7-word sessions are now shorter and with more test variety, weeeeeee!
    * A crash happened but like not the real kind so no one’s hurt - except for Steve’s pride because he’s supposed to make sure things don’t crash. Stuff happens. And it’s been fixed. So chill, Steve!
    * And something about frames and classes. Maybe a class about creating frames?

    Help us fill our bugedex by reporting any species of wild digital monsters that you catch in the app to ios@memrise.com. (I couldn’t help myself!)
Version 2.1.22 (Jul 27, 2016)
    So our sacrifice to the weather gods worked, sun and heat at last! But some stuff dramatically overheated (including a few devs) and we had to work on some fixes to get the app back to its cool-as-a-cucumber self:

    - The ‘Immersion mode’ name melted so it’s been replaced with the brand new ‘Meet the Natives’.
    - Restore purchases has been fixed
    - Affected devs were given hydrating drinks and a desk fan

    If any bugs survived the big heat wave of 2016, report them to ios@memrise.com, we’ll have great balls of fire ready to attack.
Version 2.1.21 (Jul 18, 2016)
    And so, huddled together around the warmth of our computer monitors, we managed to overcome the damp coldness of this thing known as the British Summer just enough to deliver a couple of exciting improvements to your Memrise experience:

    Improved support for right-to-left languages in tapping and typing tests
    Learning nonstop from your dashboard is now easier: launch the recommended session or pick your own!

    Also, bugs have been slain, general UI enhancements rolled out and we’re now trying to decide which dev will be offered to the weather gods in exchange of some sunshine.

    If you see any creepy crawlers going bump in the app, who you gonna call? Bug busters! Get in touch at ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.20 (Jun 30, 2016)
    I would like to take this opportunity to describe to you, in detail, the very important work that our engineers have been doing to enhance the quality and stability of the app. It’s intricate and complex. It’s mesmerising code-writing magic. It’s…something that I don’t really understand. And I’d probably just bore and confuse you. Which makes this update a bit awkward. Erm, I’ll just let the magically enhanced Memrise speak for itself, and show myself out.

    Oh, oh, wait, there’s this load of awesomeness going on too:

    - New Official Memrise courses with native speaker audio, to learn 13 languages: Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese (EU), Portuguese (BR). And more to come!
    - Video from native speakers in the French and Spanish courses. Yeah, get ready for a real Immersive experience :wink:
Version 2.1.19 (Jun 17, 2016)
    Honey, we’ve shrunk the linguists!

    To give you an EPIC learning experience that teaches you language as it’s naturally used by native speakers - and because textbooks are outdated and boring- we’ve micro-sized our international team of real flesh-and-blood language experts. They now inhabit the app in a sort of Memrise micro-cosmos, populated by all the words and phrases that they use, like, in actual, real life. Think of them as the keepers of a Universe of language learning, and you, my friend, are invited to embark on a voyage of discovery... the dawn of a new learning era.
    *Majestic stare into the horizon, dramatic music plays in the background*

    Ok, we got a little carried away there. But, for reals:
    - New Official Memrise courses with native speaker audio, to learn 13 languages: Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese (EU), Portuguese (BR). And more to come!
    - Video from native speakers in the French and Spanish courses. Yeah, get ready for a real Immersive experience ;)
    - Freshly designed interface that is easy to use and keeps you focused and motivated.
    - A new sign-up screen and target language selector.
    - And not a piece of soul-less machine-translation in sight.

    Ready for an adventure? Update, already!

    If you find any micro-cosmic bugs polluting the new home of our shrunken team of linguists (aka, the app), please send a report to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.18 (Jun 16, 2016)

    - New Official Memrise courses with native speaker audio, to learn 13 languages: Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese (EU), Portuguese (BR). And more to come!
    - Video from native speakers in the French and Spanish courses. Yeah, get ready for a real Immersive experience ;)
    - Freshly designed interface that is easy to use and keeps you focused and motivated.
    - A new sign-up screen and target language selector.
    - And not a piece of soul-less machine-translation in sight.

    Ready for an adventure? Update, already!

    If you find any micro-cosmic bugs polluting the new home of our shrunken team of linguists (aka, the app), please send a report to ios@memrise.com
Version 2.1.16 (May 16, 2016)
    Nothing major to report, we’ve just been stabilising your navigation after some pesky stowaways were causing turbulence on board, like mems being replaced with the infinitely spinning spinner, and there was this thing with an invalid delegate controlling and crashing stuff. But we have regained control and the mems are back, so it’s back to a smooth flight!

Version 2.1.14 (May 3, 2016)
    We’re upping the learning ante in this release, giving you 7 items in learning sessions, instead of 5. Piece of cake, right? You can do it!

    Other than that, there’s been a lot of bug zapping, crash fixing, coffee drinking and kitten cuddling in the past few weeks. Coffee stains and cat hair everywhere- all in the name of seamless learning joy for you.

    However, if you do manage to find a bug, let us know at ios@memrise.com.
Version 2.1.13 (Apr 21, 2016)
    Nothing but developer elbow grease in this release: bugs have been fixed and improvements have been made to make sure your Memrise experience is smoother every time you come back to learn - meaning every single day, right?
    However, if you do manage to find a bug, let us know at ios@memrise.com so we can find whose fault was it and make them pay for coffees for the rest of the month.
Version 2.1.12 (Apr 7, 2016)
    A couple of things were bugging up your learning so we've fixed them:

    - Non-Roman script fonts for languages like Chinese and Japanese are readable again. すごい!
    - Audio wasn't playing in Offline mode, but now it is - ta da!

    There's also some super hero work going on behind the scenes. It involves crashes and tracking and tokens and a super intense musical score in the background. We should totally live-stream it.

    If you find a problem, please let us know at ios@memrise.com.
Version 2.1.11 (Mar 24, 2016)
    Spring-cleaning is the theme of this update, with a few improvements that give the app an extra sunny and breezy feeling:

    - Multiple Choice boxes aren't cut off anymore, now they look as neat as a freshly arranged bouquet of flowers.

    - Font sizes have the flexibility and flow of young spring daffodils, adapting to text length and screen size.

    - We've weeded out the literal translation of words after you give a correct answer.

    If you find any bugs munching their way through our beautiful garden of an app, send word to ios@memrise.com so we can zap them straight away!
Version 2.1.10 (Mar 18, 2016)
    What's new?

    - Choosing a course that fits you right is now easier, just a few taps and you’ll be able to explore course descriptions, number of levels and words taught.
    - So it turns out you DID like how your music blended with the app audio, so we've reinstated that. If you'd rather have the app audio a cappella, go to Settings to make it happen.
    - You won't get the same items to review in a loop anymore.
    - You won't get the same items to review in a loop anymore.
    - You won't get the same items to review in a loop anymore.

    If you find a problem please let us know at ios@memrise.com. We’ll try to find a way to blame Pirate the three-legged office kitten for it.
Version 2.1.9 (Mar 6, 2016)
    It's been busy around here:

    - Memory glue has been added to the My Difficult Words Pro mode in the form of three new test types to help the slippery words stick around for good.
    - Your music and the app audio apparently didn't blend into the world's best club mix so we've worked under the hood to improve performance. Basically your music will be paused so you can hear our audio better.
    - We killed a few more bugs, polished the UI and played with the office kittens (that's what's kept us most busy tbh)

    If you find any problems please report them to ios@memrise.com. We'll reply with cat tax while we fix the issue.
Version 2.1.8 (Feb 17, 2016)
    Bug squishing spree! We'll save you the gory details but trust us, your Memrise ride will feel a lot smoother now. And, sorry, some of you experienced this thing where a creepy-crawler granted you free access to the Pro learning modes, but we've fixed that as well. Bummer.

    On to the new things: our science department paired up with the devs to find a better way to keep you motivated to learn. In this release, you'll see the results that many a failed test and broken build brought about: a redesigned Daily Goal feature that switches from points to number of words learned. Because, you know, learning 5 new words a day keeps the memory doctor away! Expect to see a new course page, the streak added to your dashboard and a shiny banner announcing this glorious improvement.

    If you experience any turbulence, send word to ios@memrise.com, we'll start sacrificing a dev's weekend time to sort it out.
Version 2.1.7 (Feb 4, 2016)
    First update of the year! Aside from the usual bug fixes and general polish, a few new surprises await:

    - A notification in your dash to let you know if your time zone is incorrect, so you don't lose your streak.

    - Feeling lucky? You might just get the chance to try out a FREE Memrise Pro session. You'll need to do some learning to find out!

    If you come across any issues, send word to ios@memrise.com

Version 2.1.1 (Nov 12, 2015)
    We're delighted to debut two substantial new features with this release:

    First we've added 1000s of native speaker videos into the Memrise English courses, turning them into a kind of mobile language immersion experience. It's a truly epic development, and though currently only available for people who are learning English, we're going to be rolling out to more languages soon - see the ​​*Membus Kickstarter*​​ for more about how we're going to do it!

    Second - and this is to be enjoyed by everyone, whatever they are learning - we've added helpful adaptive suggestions after each session for what to do next: think of this as having an intelligent assistant to optimise your learning.

    We've also made a suite of delicious new UI improvements, and fixed a very large number of bugs.

    Enjoy! And please keep all the wonderfully helpful feedback coming to ios@memrise.com Thanks!

    PS. Bonus feature! - for those lucky folks who have already got their hands on an iPhone 6S, we've added 3D Touch to the app icon to allow you to launch your next learning session right from the icon!
Version 2.1.0 (Oct 26, 2015)
    - New badges! Hit your learning goal every day and win an ever-more-prestigious ‘goal streak’ badge to adorn your profile!

    - See your problem-words more clearly: we’ve added a bubble on the ‘mode selector’ screen showing the number of difficult words. So now you know when to focus on them!

    - Bug fixes and improvements, most notably an issue that was causing Premium not to be unlocked after payment was made under certain rare circumstances.
Version 2.0.14 (Oct 8, 2015)
    This week’s modest update is dedicated to the auditory modality of our beloved user base:
    We fixed a bug affecting audio on some multiple choice tests for iOS9 users.
    We polished up the way audio plays and behaves in a number of other courses.
    We hope your ears appreciate it, and we look forward to providing treats for your other senses with a more dramatic update we’re cooking up for later in the month.
Version 2.0.13 (Sep 16, 2015)
    The iOS9 Update!

    * iOS9 users can now search for and launch courses directly from spotlight

    The first Premium mode is the memory-boosting “Difficult Words” mode to help you target and fix memories that are causing you problems. More Premium modes coming soon!

    To keep your motivation up, you can now see progress to your next rank badge at the end of each each learning session. So keep on learning!

Version 2.0.10 (Aug 11, 2015)
    The major news in this update is we’ve fixed a major crash affecting iOS7 users on app-open.

    We've also thrown in a number of micro-improvements, including:

    A percentage-complete count for course download so you can see how the offline download is progressing.
    A “review” count to the app icon so you can see how many words to review.

    And finally, we made some dozen other minor bug fixes.

    Enjoy!
Version 2.0.9 (Jul 31, 2015)
    We’re delighted to present a delicious array of micro-improvements with this update, the majority of which were proposed by our energetic community. Many thanks!

    They add up, we hope, to a new layer of lustre to the already lustrous learning experience we’re proud to purvey.

    Here are a few of them:
    - Levels and courses that have been completed now exhibit the achievement with a celebratory icon.
    - Mems containing lettering from non-Roman alphabets no longer show up as gibberish, but instead as intended. Yay for learners of Russian, Korean, Arabic, etc!
    - We’ve added in the daily-goal view even after course completion: for those learners who like to keep motivated as they consolidate and deepen their knowledge.
    - The transitions at the end-session-screen now glide with elegance where before they stuttered.
    - We’ve tweaked a number of views on the iPad version to best embrace the dimensions of that platform.
    - A subtle bug on our custom keyboard fluttered out of the app.
    - The attentive memriser will also be able to identify some dozen other micro-tweaks that smooth this or that area of the experience.

    Many thanks for the suggestions- keep ‘em coming!

    This update has lots of improvements - here are some of the most important:

    • Ignored items will no longer be tested on. If you have ignored an item on the website, the app will not test you on it either.

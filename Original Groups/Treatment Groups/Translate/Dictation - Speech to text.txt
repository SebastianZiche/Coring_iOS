App Promotional Text
Dictate App now recognizes your custom words.
App Description
Dictation - Speech to text allows to dictate, record, translate and transcribe text instead of typing. It uses latest speech to text voice recognition technology and its main purpose is speech to text and translation for text messaging. Never type any text, just dictate and translate using your speech! Nearly every app that can send text messages can be configured to operate with 'Dictation - Speech to text'. Dictate uses the builtin speech to text recognition engine.

Dictation - Speech to text features:

► Over 40 Transcribe Languages
Dictation - Speech to text supports more than 40 languages. Dictate offers 3 text zones - indicated by language flags - for which you can configure a different language in the settings. Thus you can switch between different language projects with a singe click.

► Over 40 Translation Languages
Translation is as easy as pushing the translation button. You can specify the translation target language in the app settings. Then you push the translate button to get it translated.

► Audio Recording
Both, your audio recordings and your text files can be accessed via the Apple 'Files' app.

► Transcription of Recorded Audio Files
Using the audio file transcription you can transcribe recorded audio files - containing speech - into text at a single click. All major audio file formats are supported.

► iCloud Synchronization
Having enabled iCloud, your text is automatically synchronized across all your devices running Dictate, e.g. iPhone, iPad, macOS and Apple Watch.

► Support for Impaired People
Dictate now supports the system font size setting and provides configurable button sizes for visual impaired users. Also VoiceOver is carefully configured.

► Easy Text Sharing
In order to send your dictated text messages quickly, there is a "Share"-button that allows to launch the target app, i.e. Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Flickr, Email or whatever else is capable of receiving text from the system.

► Subscriptions
Dictate offers a 7-day free trial, which converts into regular subscription unless you cancel 24h before end of trial period.

► Important Notes Concerning Subscriptions
All above Dictation - Speech to text subscriptions renew within 24 hours before the current period ends, and you will be charged through your iTunes account. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription. Manage or cancel your subscription from iTunes Account settings.

AR Translator: Translate Photo
Text, word, camera & AR modes
Reference (Applications)
Free
App Description
AR Translator will instantly extract the text from the camera's video stream and translate it into any of 100+ languages (no need to take a photo).
The special augmented reality mode will accurately replace the foreign language labels that are found in your photos with labels in your native language.

You no longer need to manually enter phone numbers, e-mail addresses and web pages printed on business cards, documents, and magazines. Just point your camera at the relevant document, and this information instantly becomes clickable.

INNOVATIVE AI TECHNOLOGY

The app uses our own AI-powered text recognition (OCR) technology. The artificial neural network that is built using deep learning algorithms runs right on your phone. This allows you to scan text incredibly quickly and efficiently.

FEATURES

● Offline OCR text grabber

● No need to select text
The app itself identifies the block of text in the video stream that you want to capture.

● Language auto-detection
You don't need to select the language of the scanned text. The language is always determined automatically.

● Translation into 100+ languages (Internet connection required)

● Instant translation of text from a video stream

● Translation of photos and images in augmented reality mode

● Ability to listen to translations

● Ability to copy the translation or scanned text and transfer it to other apps

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES

Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Cebuano, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, Farsi, Fijian, Filipino (Tagalog), Finnish, French, Galician, Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, Haitian Creole, Hausa, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Icelandic, Igbo, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Khmer, Korean, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian, Nepali, Norwegian, Nyanja, Pashto, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Serbian, Sesotho, Shona, Sindhi, Sinhalese, Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tajik, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh, Xhosa, Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu

    It’s finally here — a new look for busuu!
    Over the past month, we’ve been working on something very special: an all-new look for our courses! We’ve listened to your suggestions, added some cool ideas of our own and poured it all into what could be the biggest update in busuu history.

    Why did we do it?
    We wanted to make your learning experience even better by improving one of the core parts of our app: the "Learn" tab. We’ve now given you the ability to jump straight into where you left off by pressing on the “Next up” button. It’s now even easier to track your progress by being able to clearly see your overall progress through each lesson. And we’ve polished it all off with stunning imagery and some rather fancy animations.

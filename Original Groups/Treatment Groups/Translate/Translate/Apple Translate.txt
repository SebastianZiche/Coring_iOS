App Description
Translate lets you quickly and easily translate your voice and text between languages. Designed to be the best and easiest-to-use app for translating phrases, conversations, and even the text around you. Translate combines high-quality translations with an intuitive design, so that translating is quick and easy.

Features

• Text translation - Text translation is fast, simple, and intuitive. All supported languages include their keyboards so you don’t have to download or manually switch between them

• Voice translation - Translate your voice from one language to another. The app detects which of the two selected languages you’re speaking and provides the translated text and audio in the other language

• Conversations - In the Conversation tab, tap the single microphone button to speak, and automatic language detection will transcribe what you say in chat bubbles on the correct side of the conversation

• Translate camera - Translate text around you using the camera view. Translate text in real-time, pause the view to zoom in for a closer look, or translate text in photos from your Photos library

• Dictionary - Tap a word in a completed translation to see the definition in the built‑in dictionary

• On-device mode - Enable a fully offline experience in Translate and for downloaded languages. Keep your translations private without needing to turn off your internet connection

• Auto Translate - Translate speech without tapping the microphone button in a conversation. Auto Translate automatically detects when you start speaking and when you stop, so the other person can just respond

• Face to face view - Change the conversation view when chatting face to face so that each person can see the conversation from their own side

• Favorites - For phrases you use frequently and want to keep, save them to your Favorites for easy access later

Version 9.0 (Sep 21, 2015)
    Introducing iTranslate for watchOS 2 and big update for iOS 9.

    This update brings you 2 major new improvements. A fully native App for watchOS 2 and a big update for iOS 9 with support for Split View, Slide Over and Spotlight.


    WATCH OS 2 UPDATES:

    - Fully native App built for watchOS 2.

    - Uses watchOS 2’s built-in voice recognition technology to instantly translate words, phrases, and text into more than 90 languages.

    - Play back translations through the watch speaker — no need to pull out your phone. 

    - Complications give you a quick and easy way to start a translation right from your Watch Face. It even automatically sets the language for you based on your current location. For example, when you arrive in Berlin, iTranslate for Apple watchOS 2 will know that the local language is German and set it accordingly. All you need to do is glance at your Apple Watch and tap a button to start a translation.

    - Complications will automatically display common phrases like "good morning" and „good evening" on the watch face in the local language when you're abroad. The phrases are based on your location and the time of day.

    - The new "Time Travel" feature lets you see phrases for a later time of day to make it easier to communicate — for instance, learn how to say "good night" in the local language before dinner so you're ready to say it when you leave. You can also see your recent translations by simply traveling back in time.


    iOS 9 UPDATES:

    - Split View: Boost your productivity by putting iTranslate side-by-side with any App. iTranslate is the perfect companion App when you are working on a document in another language, doing your Spanish homework or when you are simply browsing the web. The iTranslate User Interface automatically adapts perfectly to any size you set, to ensure absolute flexibility. Thanks to Split View you now don’t need to go back and forth all the time to do a simple translation, making the iPad Air 2 and especially the new iPad Pro serious desktop replacements.

    - Slide Over: In many cases you don’t need iTranslate side-by-side, but only for this one quick translation lookup. With Slide Over iTranslate is now just one swipe away. Whatever you are up to, you can now bring up iTranslate with one simply swipe from the right side of your iPad Screen and you’ll never be lost in translation again. The best thing: Slide Over will work on any iPad that supports iOS 9.

    - Spotlight: Look up your recent translations trough Spotlight. Simply start typing and iTranslate will instantly show you recent translations right in Spotlight.
Version 8.4 (Aug 19, 2015)
    KEYBOARD EXTENSION
    Introducing iTranslate Keyboard. With our brand-new and free Keyboard Extension you can now translate into over 90 languages in ANY App. Here are some possible scenarios:

    - Chat with a Spanish girl right in WhatsApp
    - Answer an Email in Chinese in the Mail App of your choice
    - Post a tweet in French to impress your Twitter followers

    And did we already mention that it is completely free :-)

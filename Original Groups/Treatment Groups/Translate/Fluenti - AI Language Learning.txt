App Description
Fluenti is an AI language-learning app that lets you learn a new language by speaking with a human-like AI. From making a doctor's appointment to planning a weekend getaway, Fluenti immerses you in a life-like learning environment like never before! Join the language revolution by downloading Fluenti today.

Why Fluenti:
Our AI-powered platform lets you practice speaking with your AI tutors about any topic in a completely stress-free environment. The AI will talk back based on what you say, so you can enjoy a natural, ongoing dialogue anytime, anywhere!

You can get 3X faster with Sample responses, Grammar correction, and Fluency improvement features. If you don't know what to say, simply tap the 'Not sure what to say...' button to see two sample responses. They will be tailored to the context of the dialogue so you can learn to speak natural-sounding phrases. You will also get instant feedback on your grammar every time you speak so you can improve your grammar noticeably faster. That's not all. Fluenti offers the fluency improvement feature, which transforms your phrases into a more fluent version. Watch yourself speak more naturally and like a local!

Fluenti also offers 200+ conversation topics designed to keep you engaged and motivated. You will find a topic relevant to your life situation, so you can rehearse it before you face any real situation. Do you have a job interview in your second language? Are you traveling abroad? Don't worry. We got you covered!

Our Mission:
Our mission is to empower billions of people to get fluent faster. This is why leading language experts, developers, and designers have gathered to collaborate and achieve the mission. We also know that learning a new language is tough and tedious, so we've developed a program that will keep you motivated and thrilled.

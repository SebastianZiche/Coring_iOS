What's New

Version 3.3.0 (Dec 13, 2023)
    Version 3.3.0

    New helper tips are now in Flow to help you discover all our great features. We've also fixed some bugs.

    Version 3.2.2

    We've fixed a handful of rendering bugs, worked on app performance and fixed a couple of minor crashes.

    Version 3.1.1

    This update introduces a great new way to use color in Flow, customizable background colors for documents and a whole bunch of little UI improvements.

    COLOR PALETTE
    Flow has a new option to display a set of colors on screen for quickly switching color whilst you stay on the same drawing tool. You can setup these colors however you like, and the palette will be saved as part of the document you are working on.

    Tap the new ‘document colors’ button at the top of the screen next to the undo button to turn the document colors on and off. (Note: the ‘reset zoom’ button has been retired from this top menu.)

    Tapping on one of the colors will set your current tool to that color, and you can tap a color twice to open a color picker. You can also press and hold on a color to get the eyedropper and choose from a color somewhere on the screen.

    On iPad you can choose where on the screen the color palette goes by dragging it around, it can snap to either the top or bottom of the screen, or next to the Tool Editor. Just drag on any of the colors towards the center of the screen and the snap locations will appear. On iPhone the colors only display at the top of the screen.

    You can return the colors to the default set by pressing and holding on the colors button at the top of the screen.

    DOCUMENT BACKGROUND COLOR
    You can now customize the background color of your document using a color picker. The 16 default light and dark options are shown as smaller circles next to the large circle that shows the current color. Tap one of the small circles to choose that color, and tap the large color circle to open the color picker and customize it.

    TOOL EDITOR
    When you have a drawing tool selected, the tool editor now displays an icon at the top indicating the pen type. You can press and hold on this icon to bring up a list of pen types and swap to it.

    LAYERS
    The layers menu has been updated:

    - The layer color indicator is now a bar instead of a circle
    - New icons for the buttons at the top to choose between side docking or floating
    - New ‘switch’ style button instead of a tick icon for showing when layers are active or not
    - A new option to drag and choose the height of the layers panel when it is floating, the drag bar becomes available once you have more than 4 layers and will remember the height you set
    - Layers will now hide on iPad when you’re in pencil case mode
    - Improved the layout when shown on iPhone in pencil case mode

    PASTEBOARD
    The pasteboard screen has an updated look that now shows your pasteboard content in a grid layout with two columns, and button to enable edit mode for removing content. The icon has also been updated.

    NEW DEFAULT TOOLS
    The set of default tools has been updated to be more suitable for note-taking.

    UI IMPROVEMENTS
    - Simplified the eyedropper ui to focus on just showing the new color being chosen
    - Updated the look of the color swatches shown when the eyedropper is active and it now shows a grayscale range of color options if you’re on a gray color
    - Layers UI now hides and unhides when the pen editor is opened
    - Updated the tool editor size control style to make the currently selected size more prominent
    - Added a new ‘disconnect pencil case’ icon when pencil case mode is on
    - The pen sets screen now uses the dark interface mode if it is on
    - Updated the pen sets button icon
    - Lowered the position of the pens at the bottom of the screen on iPhone to make more room to see the document
    - Updated the pen editor style on iPhone to dock completely up against the top bar
    - When choosing a background pattern for a document the pattern size and opacity controls now fold away if you have chosen no pattern

Version 3.0.4 (Jul 20, 2023)
    3.0.4

    Crash fixes.

    3.0.0

    LAYERS
    Layers are now available in Flow. It’s been one of our most requested features and we’ve spent months working with our testers to get it just right.

    Layers are like stacked pieces of transparent paper. You can draw on them independently, you can merge them, rearrange their order, hide or show them and change their opacity. Layers create a safeguard for your work so you can change individual parts while preserving the rest. For example, you might sketch something with pencil on one layer, then draw over the top with ink then hide the original pencil sketch layer completely. You can also bring that layer back if you want to start again.

    FLOW WEB VIEWER
    You can now view your Flow documents in your web browser! Just login with your account at flowapp.moleskinestudio.com to check it out.

    PRESSURE CURVES
    You can now choose from four different Apple Pencil pressure curves, along with the corresponding influence that the curve has on your drawing. You can easily access this by the Gesture Settings button along the top right.

    HOVER
    If you have the latest iPad Pro with Apple Pencil, you can now see a preview of your strokes when hovering.

    PEN SIZES
    We’ve added WAY more pen sizes. Bigger. Smaller. We’ve got it all.

    PANNING
    You can now pan the canvas further off screen when zoomed, making it easier to position your work where you want it.

    PERFORMANCE
    There are some big performance boosts in this release, reducing latency and load times even more.

    MARKER TOOL BLENDING
    The chisel marker and round marker tools now apply their ink additively to the page, so when you draw with multiple passes the colour remains the same but increases in strength, whereas previously these tools would darken the page as you drew over a spot multiple times.

    PENCIL CASE
    If you haven’t already tried Pencil Case - it moves your tools to your iPhone screen so you can have an immersive experience on iPad. We’ve streamlined the Pencil Case layout to be clearer and we’ve added Layers so you can dedicate your iPhone to controlling them, giving you more real estate on iPad. Give it a try by opening Flow on both devices side by side and watch the magic happen.

    SELECTING
    - When using the Lasso, you can now just tap to select objects rather than having to draw around them.
    - You can toggle whether your selection comes from the current layer or all enabled layers.
    - With an active selection, you can choose a different layer and tap ‘Move to current layer’ to reorganise your document.
    - If you want to select everything, tap and hold on the Lasso Knife in the tool dock.

    ROTATING AND SCALING
    - Objects now have handles which allows you to scale from corners or from the centre.
    - The new rotate handle allows more accurate spinning goodness by showing the degrees of rotation.
    - You can turn on ‘Snap’ by tapping the magnet icon to lock moving along an axis (shown by yellow guide lines). Rotation will be locked to 5º increments.

    IMAGES
    - It’s now easier to use images in your documents.
    - Just tap an image with the Lasso to see the new images editor with options for editing opacity, resetting rotation or replacing the image with another.

    TIMELAPSE
    Our timelapse feature is unique because you can open any of your documents and retroactively create an awesome timelapse video from it. We’ve added a great new setting where you can choose whether it’s created based on time strokes were drawn, or based on the layered order of them (bottom to top). We’ve also tweaked the GIF export so it repeats the last frame so it highlights the end result. We love sharing Timelapse GIFs on Instagram so be sure to tag us @moleskinestudio when you post there.

    INTERFACE

Version 3.0.3 (Jun 29, 2023)
    LAYERS
    Layers are now available in Flow. It’s been one of our most requested features and we’ve spent months working with our testers to get it just right.

    Layers are like stacked pieces of transparent paper. You can draw on them independently, you can merge them, rearrange their order, hide or show them and change their opacity. Layers create a safeguard for your work so you can change individual parts while preserving the rest. For example, you might sketch something with pencil on one layer, then draw over the top with ink then hide the original pencil sketch layer completely. You can also bring that layer back if you want to start again.

    FLOW WEB VIEWER
    You can now view your Flow documents in your web browser! Just login with your account at flowapp.moleskinestudio.com to check it out.

    PRESSURE CURVES
    You can now choose from four different Apple Pencil pressure curves, along with the corresponding influence that the curve has on your drawing. You can easily access this by the Gesture Settings button along the top right.

    HOVER
    If you have the latest iPad Pro with Apple Pencil, you can now see a preview of your strokes when hovering.

    PEN SIZES
    We’ve added WAY more pen sizes. Bigger. Smaller. We’ve got it all.

    PANNING
    You can now pan the canvas further off screen when zoomed, making it easier to position your work where you want it.

    PERFORMANCE
    There are some big performance boosts in this release, reducing latency and load times even more.

    MARKER TOOL BLENDING
    The chisel marker and round marker tools now apply their ink additively to the page, so when you draw with multiple passes the colour remains the same but increases in strength, whereas previously these tools would darken the page as you drew over a spot multiple times.

    PENCIL CASE
    If you haven’t already tried Pencil Case - it moves your tools to your iPhone screen so you can have an immersive experience on iPad. We’ve streamlined the Pencil Case layout to be clearer and we’ve added Layers so you can dedicate your iPhone to controlling them, giving you more real estate on iPad. Give it a try by opening Flow on both devices side by side and watch the magic happen.

    SELECTING
    - When using the Lasso, you can now just tap to select objects rather than having to draw around them.
    - You can toggle whether your selection comes from the current layer or all enabled layers.
    - With an active selection, you can choose a different layer and tap ‘Move to current layer’ to reorganise your document.
    - If you want to select everything, tap and hold on the Lasso Knife in the tool dock.

    ROTATING AND SCALING
    - Objects now have handles which allows you to scale from corners or from the centre.
    - The new rotate handle allows more accurate spinning goodness by showing the degrees of rotation.
    - You can turn on ‘Snap’ by tapping the magnet icon to lock moving along an axis (shown by yellow guide lines). Rotation will be locked to 5º increments.

    IMAGES
    - It’s now easier to use images in your documents.
    - Just tap an image with the Lasso to see the new images editor with options for editing opacity, resetting rotation or replacing the image with another.

    TIMELAPSE
    Our timelapse feature is unique because you can open any of your documents and retroactively create an awesome timelapse video from it. We’ve added a great new setting where you can choose whether it’s created based on time strokes were drawn, or based on the layered order of them (bottom to top). We’ve also tweaked the GIF export so it repeats the last frame so it highlights the end result. We love sharing Timelapse GIFs on Instagram so be sure to tag us @moleskinestudio when you post there.

Version 2.9.5 (Nov 22, 2022)
    v2.9.5

    • General bug fixes & polish.

    --- Previous Updates ---

    v2.9.2

    • Improvements to onboarding experience.

    v2.9

    • In this update, the "Recent Documents" widget can now show on your iOS16 Lock Screen.
    • Flow also now supports the new iOS16 Focus Filters, so you can filter which collections are visible in the app at particular times of day or when you're in particular locations e.g. show your Work collections when at work, and your Personal collections when at home. This is configured on iOS16 in the "Focus" section of Settings.

    v2.8.4

    Improved drawing latency and fixed a bug causing lag when drawing for some users

    v2.8

    This update is all about zooming and navigating your documents.

    Zooming
    Zooming out on your documents is a highly requested feature that we are excited to get into your hands! It’s great for seeing a broader context of what you are working on, as you can now see more on screen at once just by pinching out. To get back to normal size, just zoom the document to near the screen size and it’ll automatically snap back into place, or tap the new reset zoom button at the top of the screen

    Panning Document Edges
    Working on the edges of your document is much easier now - when zooming in you can pan the edges to the middle of the screen for more ergonomic drawing. We’ve also refined panning when you are zoomed in so it’s more precise.

    Pages
    Along with this great new feature, we’ve also added an additional page-divider style which visualises your document as a strip of individual pages. You can still seamlessly draw across the edges as before, this is an optional viewing mode.

    Scrubber Options
    We’ve added new options for when the document panning scrubber appears. You can now choose if the scrubber shows when zooming in, when panning, or not at all. We’ve also used our shrink-ray to reduce the size of it a little, and in vertical documents it not longer replaces the tool editor when shown.

    Other updates
    We’ve improved the top menu. It now accomodate the system button on iPad with a blank space in the center. The pasteboard button has moved to the left and a new reset zoom button has been added on the right. On both iPad and iPhone the top area of the screen now changes dynamically to keep the buttons legible as your document content moves behind them.

    • Fixes an issue that could cause the app to sign out from the current account.

    • Flow also now supports the new iOS16 Focus Filters, so you can filter which collections are visible in the app at particular times of day or when you're in particular locations e.g. show your Work collections when at work, and your Personal collections when at home. This is configured on iOS16 in the "Focus" section of Settings.

    v2.8.4

    Improved drawing latency and fixed a bug causing lag when drawing for some users

    v2.8

    This update is all about zooming and navigating your documents.

    Zooming
    Zooming out on your documents is a highly requested feature that we are excited to get into your hands! It’s great for seeing a broader context of what you are working on, as you can now see more on screen at once just by pinching out. To get back to normal size, just zoom the document to near the screen size and it’ll automatically snap back into place, or tap the new reset zoom button at the top of the screen

    Panning Document Edges
    Working on the edges of your document is much easier now - when zooming in you can pan the edges to the middle of the screen for more ergonomic drawing. We’ve also refined panning when you are zoomed in so it’s more precise.

    Pages
    Along with this great new feature, we’ve also added an additional page-divider style which visualises your document as a strip of individual pages. You can still seamlessly draw across the edges as before, this is an optional viewing mode.

    Scrubber Options
    We’ve added new options for when the document panning scrubber appears. You can now choose if the scrubber shows when zooming in, when panning, or not at all. We’ve also used our shrink-ray to reduce the size of it a little, and in vertical documents it not longer replaces the tool editor when shown.

    Other updates
    We’ve improved the top menu. It now accomodate the system button on iPad with a blank space in the center. The pasteboard button has moved to the left and a new reset zoom button has been added on the right. On both iPad and iPhone the top area of the screen now changes dynamically to keep the buttons legible as your document content moves behind them.

    • Fixes an issue that could cause the app to sign out from the current account.

Version 2.5.1 (Oct 26, 2021)
    Welcome to Flow 2.5 – this is a huge update with exciting new features and enhancements to the existing things you already love.


    SHAREPLAY

    Flow has pioneered collaboration in a drawing app and with SharePlay, you can now automatically share a Flow document while on FaceTime. Strokes appear in realtime so it’s just like sharing a piece of paper, wherever you are.

    To use SharePlay, ensure all devices have been updated to iOS 15.1 or above and when on FaceTime just open Flow and follow the prompts. If other participants do not have a Flow membership, they will still be able to collaborate with you whilst on the call.

    Special mention to our tireless Adam D who has spent many hours on FaceTime calls with himself whilst in the testing phase of the SharePlay feature. Adam1, please remember Adam2 is probably not real but we hope you created some wonderful art together.


    PEN SETS

    Pen Sets is a huge new feature we are really excited to get in your hands. It’s a simple and powerful new way to use pens in Flow that will improve how you work and create. Instead of a single dock of pens, you can now create multiple sets of pens and quickly swap between them.

    For example you can now curate a set of pens for taking notes, and another set for colored pencil sketching, and swap between them with either a gesture or the new Pen Sets button on the Pen Dock. You can create multiple set of pens with a range of colors for easy access.

    Flow will remember which of your Pen Sets you were using for each document and automatically switch to the last set you were using as you move between documents.

    On the Pen Sets screen you can swipe between all your Pen Sets, create new ones and edit them. When editing you can add a name for the Pen Set and re-arrange the pens within it. You can tap on each pen to edit it individually. You can also delete, duplicate and drag pens between your sets.

    You can even share Pen Sets with other people by sending them a special link. Sharing is caring right?


    NEW EYEDROPPER

    We’ve improved both the eyedropper and quick color grid tools. In fact they’ve merged (Voltron style) into a more powerful tool than you can possibly imagine. The new eyedropper icon on the Tool Editor replaces what was previously the Quick Color Grid button. Press and hold on it to instantly activate the eyedropper.

    When the eyedropper is active, the Tool Editor changes to display a redesigned color grid with a range of shade and tint variations on the current color. You can drag over these to select one, or drag over the canvas or pens to pick a new color. The eyedropper itself now displays as a ring, with one half showing your existing color for comparison.

    IMESSAGE STICKER APP

    Draw your own custom set of iMessage stickers from Flow. When you save selections from your documents into the pasteboard, they automatically become available in the new Flow iMessage app. Your stickers are synced between devices so you can create them on your iPad and send them from your iPhone.


    ENHANCEMENTS

    - Delete items from the pasteboard by tapping the new delete button
    - Refinement of icons and button spacing through the app
    - Adjusted the size of the tool editor
    - Pen opacity control now displays in the ink color
    - Highlighted tools and menus now use a higher contrast black and white scheme
    - Pen Dock layout fine tuned for smaller devices
    - Timing improved so selecting tools is more responsive
    - Range of greys increased in tool editor
    - Pencil Case interface refined


    BUG FIXES

    - Fixed an issue that could cause the Pen Opacity control to not respond to first tap
    - Lots of other minor fixes

Version 2.4.7 (Aug 9, 2021)
    v2.4.7
    • Minor enhancements

    v2.4.6
    • Fixes the size of the pen editor when using pencil case mode on the iPhone


    -- Previous updates --

    v2.4:
    Thanks for all of your great suggestions, we've completed a lot of popular feature requests in this version:

    • PDF page import. Choose a PDF from Import > Files then select any page to place it on your Flow document. Boom.
    • Tool opacity control. You asked for it and here it is! The new slider on the toolbar and tool editor controls the opacity of the selected tool. Setting it lower will decrease the strength at which the tool applies ink on the page.
    • Correction Pen / Eraser. We’ve rebuilt the Eraser! Instead of having two modes, it is now two separate tools, making it quicker and easier to use. Choose the Eraser for when you want to remove entire strokes or images, choose the Correction Pen when you want to partially trim or cut into strokes and images.
    • Graphite Pencil tool opacity now responds more rapidly to Apple Pencil pressure.
    • Airbrush refined to suit the capabilities offered by the new opacity control.
    • Improvements to tool response time.
    • Thumbnails for your documents are now based on your last-edit position instead of last-viewed.


    v2.3:
    This update adds another great new function: the curve line. When the ruler is active, tap the line button (under shape options on the left side) and choose curve. You can then create whatever curve you need by moving the control points that appear on your ruler. The curve line also works when the ruler is set to mask mode.

    We've also been hard at work under the hood, tuning our drawing engine technology. This update contains significant performance improvements to make drawing feel even smoother and more responsive. If you use Flow for writing, you'll notice it feels quicker than ever before.


    v2.2:
    We are super excited to release one of our biggest features ever (and the most requested) – say hello to the Ruler!

    We thought long and hard about design of the Flow Ruler, and the result is a whole new take that you’ve never seen before. We think you’re going to love it! It’s all about empowering you to draw quickly and precisely, from simple lines and shapes all the way up to sophisticated multi-point perspective drawing.

    Here’s a few things you can do with it:

    • Draw straight lines and precise angles
    • Draw perfect circles, ellipses, squares and rectangles
    • Snap the ruler to background patterns for extra precision and spacing guidance
    • Use masking to shade inside and outside shapes as well as along straight lines
    • Turn on advanced reference lines for 1, 2 and 3 point perspectives

    Also in this version, Flow now has a shiny new App Clip. When you share a document with someone who doesn’t yet have Flow, this will allow them to preview it quickly before they download the full app.
Version 2.4.5 (Jul 21, 2021)
    Thanks for all of your great suggestions, we've completed a lot of popular feature requests in this version:

    • PDF page import. Choose a PDF from Import > Files then select any page to place it on your Flow document. Boom.

    • Tool opacity control. You asked for it and here it is! The new slider on the toolbar and tool editor controls the opacity of the selected tool. Setting it lower will decrease the strength at which the tool applies ink on the page.

    • Correction Pen / Eraser. We’ve rebuilt the Eraser! Instead of having two modes, it is now two separate tools, making it quicker and easier to use. Choose the Eraser for when you want to remove entire strokes or images, choose the Correction Pen when you want to partially trim or cut into strokes and images.

    • Graphite Pencil tool opacity now responds more rapidly to Apple Pencil pressure.

    • Airbrush refined to suit the capabilities offered by the new opacity control.

    • Improvements to tool response time.

    • Thumbnails for your documents are now based on your last-edit position instead of last-viewed.

    Let us know what you think and remember, we build what you ask for - just go to the Menu > Help > Request Feature.



    -- Previous updates --

    v2.3:
    This update adds another great new function: the curve line. When the ruler is active, tap the line button (under shape options on the left side) and choose curve. You can then create whatever curve you need by moving the control points that appear on your ruler. The curve line also works when the ruler is set to mask mode.

    We've also been hard at work under the hood, tuning our drawing engine technology. This update contains significant performance improvements to make drawing feel even smoother and more responsive. If you use Flow for writing, you'll notice it feels quicker than ever before.

Version 2.1.5 (Feb 1, 2021)
    v2.1.5
    • General polish & fixes.

    v2.1
    We have some great new features in this update:

    GROUPING
    You can now make a selection with the Lasso Knife and group those items together into a single object. This is a powerful new feature that makes it quick and easy to make reusable drawings which can be easily selected, overlapped and rearranged. To use grouping, simply tap the chain icon once you make a selection. You can ungroup by tapping the broken chain icon.

    VISUAL CLIPBOARD
    There is a shiny new icon in the top bar – say hello to the visual clipboard. Your most recent items that have been copied to the clipboard will appear here, making it quick and easy to copy complex selections, especially between different documents. Just tap an item to insert it to your active document.

    COMING SOON
    We are working on an awesome new feature that starts with R and ends in ULER. We can’t wait to bring it to you and will be sharing more details soon.


    v2.0.3
    •Fixed a crash seen by some of our users


    v2.0.2
    • Improved gesture support.
    • General polish & fixes.


    v2.0.1
    • General polish & fixes.


    v2.0
    REALTIME COLLABORATION:
    With Flow 2, multiple people can work on the same document at the same time from separate devices wherever they are in the world. It’s a truly groundbreaking way to collaborate, now more than ever. We had architects who wanted to mark out designs with their assistant who’s based on the other side of town. Employers needing to collaborate with their staff that are working from home. Grandparents wanting to color in with their grandchildren remotely.


    VERTICAL DOCUMENTS
    You now have the option to choose a vertical document if top-to-bottom infinite canvas works better for you than side to side infinite canvas. You choose orientation when creating a new document, and this cannot be changed once set.


    PENCIL CASE MODE
    We want Flow to disappear when you’re using it, so we invented Pencil Case mode to give the option of taking your tools away from your iPad screen entirely and putting them on your iPhone instead. It separates the artistic and utilitarian sides of your creation so you can have a clean space to work - without the clutter of your tools. You simply place your iPad and iPhone side by side, open Flow on both of them and through magic (or rather some very clever coding) your tools are shown on your iPhone. Just make sure you are signed into the same Flow account on both devices.


    IMAGES
    You may have noticed we quietly launched this recently but now it’s ready for everyone. Here’s what you can do:

    - Add images to your document from Photo Library or Files (including iCloud, Dropbox, Adobe Creative Cloud, Box, OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon)
    - Take photos directly in Flow and then draw on top of them
    - Paste images from your clipboard, even from your other devices like Mac using Universal Clipboard
    - Drag and drop to grab images from other apps
    - Use the Lasso Knife tool for rotating, resizing and moving your image
    - Duplicate images to save you from adding the image again
    - Change the opacity by using the long press menu


    MORE

    - All new sync engine - performance and stability are better than ever thanks to our all new sync engine, built from the ground up.
    - Flow on iPhone - now opens documents in read-only mode so it’s easier to navigate without accidentally drawing. Tap and hold the pen icon to open your tools.
    - Clipboard - copy lasso selections to your clipboard and paste into other Flow documents. If you have universal clipboard enabled, you can paste an image directly onto your Mac or other iOS/iPadOS device in any app.

    If you experience any issues at all, our team is here to help - just email flow@moleskinestudio.com or tap Help > Talk To Our Team from the Flow menu.

Your most recent items that have been copied to the clipboard will appear here, making it quick and easy to copy complex selections, especially between different documents. Just tap an item to insert it to your active document.

    COMING SOON
    We are working on an awesome new feature that starts with R and ends in ULER. We can’t wait to bring it to you and will be sharing more details soon.


    v2.0.3
    •Fixed a crash seen by some of our users


    v2.0.2
    • Improved gesture support.
    • General polish & fixes.


    v2.0.1
    • General polish & fixes.


    v2.0
    REALTIME COLLABORATION:
    With Flow 2, multiple people can work on the same document at the same time from separate devices wherever they are in the world. It’s a truly groundbreaking way to collaborate, now more than ever. We had architects who wanted to mark out designs with their assistant who’s based on the other side of town. Employers needing to collaborate with their staff that are working from home. Grandparents wanting to color in with their grandchildren remotely.


    VERTICAL DOCUMENTS
    You now have the option to choose a vertical document if top-to-bottom infinite canvas works better for you than side to side infinite canvas. You choose orientation when creating a new document, and this cannot be changed once set.


    PENCIL CASE MODE
    We want Flow to disappear when you’re using it, so we invented Pencil Case mode to give the option of taking your tools away from your iPad screen entirely and putting them on your iPhone instead. It separates the artistic and utilitarian sides of your creation so you can have a clean space to work - without the clutter of your tools. You simply place your iPad and iPhone side by side, open Flow on both of them and through magic (or rather some very clever coding) your tools are shown on your iPhone. Just make sure you are signed into the same Flow account on both devices.


    IMAGES
    You may have noticed we quietly launched this recently but now it’s ready for everyone. Here’s what you can do:

    - Add images to your document from Photo Library or Files (including iCloud, Dropbox, Adobe Creative Cloud, Box, OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon)
    - Take photos directly in Flow and then draw on top of them
    - Paste images from your clipboard, even from your other devices like Mac using Universal Clipboard
    - Drag and drop to grab images from other apps
    - Use the Lasso Knife tool for rotating, resizing and moving your image
    - Duplicate images to save you from adding the image again
    - Change the opacity by using the long press menu


    MORE

    - All new sync engine - performance and stability are better than ever thanks to our all new sync engine, built from the ground up.
    - Flow on iPhone - now opens documents in read-only mode so it’s easier to navigate without accidentally drawing. Tap and hold the pen icon to open your tools.
    - Clipboard - copy lasso selections to your clipboard and paste into other Flow documents. If you have universal clipboard enabled, you can paste an image directly onto your Mac or other iOS/iPadOS device in any app.

Version 2.1.1 (Dec 24, 2020)

    • General polish & fixes.

    v2.1
    We have some great new features in this update:

    GROUPING
    You can now make a selection with the Lasso Knife and group those items together into a single object. This is a powerful new feature that makes it quick and easy to make reusable drawings which can be easily selected, overlapped and rearranged. To use grouping, simply tap the chain icon once you make a selection. You can ungroup by tapping the broken chain icon.

    How does it work?

    In a nutshell, it takes your tools and creates a Pencil Case ‘in’ your phone. So you draw on your iPad and your tools are on your iPhone. This clears up your iPad screen for full immersion in your project. Just like a physical notebook.

    You simply place your iPad and iPhone side by side, open Flow on both of them and through magic (or rather some very clever coding) your tools are shown on your iPhone. Just make sure you are signed into the same Flow account on both devices.

Version 1.3.0 (Sep 30, 2020)
    This is the biggest under-the-hood release of Flow ever. It introduces our all new sync engine that improves stability and performance. We’ve been working hard on this for several months and we’re excited to finally get it in your hands. This update lays the foundation for some big new features to be launched in the coming weeks and provides a significant performance boost, particularly for large documents.

    When you open this new version for the first time, you will see a loading screen which migrates your data to make it compatible with the update. You will need to be online for this to happen. Please ensure all of your devices also have this latest version of Flow, otherwise they will not be able to open your documents.

    v1.1.4
    This update fixes some small issues that have recently been discovered.

    v1.1.3
    Thanks to everyone for the amazing feedback about the Lasso Knife feature, we are glad you are enjoying it! This release contains fun new features as requested by you. As always, message us directly from the Help screen with any feedback and ideas you have.

    - New Background Pattern Options -
    You can now adjust the opacity of background patterns and choose between small or large scale.

    - New Isometric Background Pattern -
    If you feel passionately about angles, you know what we’re talking about.

    - Improved Scrubber -
    The scrubber for navigating your document now hides along with other interface elements when in fullscreen mode.

    It also now hides when zooming your document so there is less chance of bumping it.

    - Lasso Knife Enhancement -
    The Lasso Knife now places your selection when you tap another tool (thanks for pointing this out Guilherme!). We’ve also fixed some rare bugs with z order.

    - Reduced Drawing Safe Area around UI -
    You can now start drawing closer to the tool editor.

    v1.1.1:
    Fixes a rare bug that could cause the app to crash at launch.

    v1.1:
    A wild tool appears! Introducing the new Lasso Knife tool, a powerful new way to create with Flow.

    - Move and rotate -
    With the Lasso Knife you can trace around parts of your drawing that you want to select and edit. The selected strokes lift off the page, you can move them by dragging around and tap to place them back down. When you have something selected you can also use two fingers to rotate.

    - Duplicate -
    You can copy anything you have selected by tapping the duplicate button on the tool editor. If you are using an Apple Pencil you can also press and hold a finger down then drag with the Pencil to create a copy.

    - Select by pen type -
    The Lasso Knife allows you to choose what kind of pen strokes it selects from the page. You can toggle each option from the tool editor when the Lasso Knife is your active tool. This is super handy when you want to edit just one part of your drawing, for example you can select just the graphite pencil lines from a sketch you’ve drawn over top of with a fineliner pen.

    - Recolor -
    You can change the color of any strokes you have selected, just press on the recolor icon and drag over your page or pens to get a new color. This feature becomes extra powerful when combined with selecting by pen type - for example you can select just the chisel marker shading on your drawing and modify its color.

    This update introduces a significant improvement to the drawing engine that reduces document size and improves rendering speed.

    --General Fixes and Improvements--
    - Changed the grayscale strip in the tool editor to be non-linear, providing a better range of near white options.
    - Adjusted the order of tools in editor to group similar blending styles together.

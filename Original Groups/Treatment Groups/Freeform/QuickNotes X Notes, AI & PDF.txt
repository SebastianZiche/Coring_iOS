    New in version 4.1:
    Here is the long-awaited update! This version brings a lot of exciting features to QuickNotes X, such as:
    ⊱ Text Boxes: Now you can insert Text Boxes to your notes, so that you can even type instead of writing directly. You can even change attributes, such as font, size and color, to take great notes even when typing.
    ⊱ Password-locked Notebooks: for an added layer of privacy and security you can now set a Password to lock a notebook. When you will need to reopen it you will be prompted to insert the password or to use Touch ID/Face ID to unlock it.
    ⊱ Speed and Performance Improvements: We have also worked hard to speed up the loading times of notebooks, and the notes list will now scroll faster and smoother. Previews will now load directly from disk, so a "loading" icon may appear before a preview will show up. And the size of new note files has been reduced by about 50%, so that you can take more notes with less space.
    ⊱ Now Undo/Redo will have an effect also on set views and images import as overlay
    ⊱ Modernized the UI and Launch Screen to look better on iOS 13 and with Dark Mode enabled
    ⊱ Fixed bugs related to Adonit styluses

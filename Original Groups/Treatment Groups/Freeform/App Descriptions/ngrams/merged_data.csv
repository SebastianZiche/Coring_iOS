1624344916,0,DoMemo Simple Notes System,Productivity,2022-09-17,2022-09-17,53.22,3.0,0,0,1,A New Balance A typical note is more words and complex a typical memo is less wordy and sometimes ad hoc and much lighter too. We found that there is a new balance between notes and memos also the scenarios that we often encounter such as writing inspirations down or a reverie or the deepest feeling after reading a book. There are not too many words but is not temporary it should be light but also can be complex like giving tags and connections for future management and review. That s why we designed DoMemo this App a new balance a new personal note system. We believe that be simple and be powerful are never contradictory. About DoMemo Some Keywords Local Full Text Search History Versions Voice Recording Voice to Text iCloud Drive sync Git sync Card Notes Memory Curve 200 Words Tags Backward Links... Above Simplicity Make Yourself as The Method Notes in DoMemo can have tags or not have backward links or not use Markdown syntax or not cardify or ignore the cards be scientific or humanistic. DoMemo will not deliberately cut down the features to keep the simplicity as a tool it should provide convenience to users without thinking about how to use it. 200 Words The Liberation The default maximum words per DoMemo note is 200 you can adjust it in the App settings. The 200 words limit does not limit human imagination but rather liberates the boundaries of our thinking at another level. Because of this limit when we need to summarize what we have read in a book we will deliberately keep it concise and concise when we take notes as we go we don t need to consider the structure of the context so we really can write freely. When writing become of stress free there will be a magical effect produced simply put it will be easier to write and will write more words finally ...... Local First No Registration Required DoMemo s notes data is stored locally and does not depend on any official servers so you don t have to worry that one day the data service will be unavailable and the notes will not be migrated any more. There is no need to register an account to use DoMemo so you don t have to worry about compromising your account password. DoMemo uses an open file system structure with folders text documents images and audio files so all you need to do to back up or migrate DoMemo data is copy a folder paste it into the location you need in Finder or Filess and it s done. Syncing by iCloud Drive or Git As the designer and developer of DoMemo we don t want to touch users notes data and we believe most of users don t want their data to be hosted by a notes tool provider. It s not just about data privacy and data security but also about the long term life of the notes system from a longer term perspective. That s why DoMemo adopts the principle of local first data. Even if it is local first it can also be synced across devices. DoMemo s notes are synced using iCloud Drive by default. Domemo just simply put an additional copy of each note to be stored on iCloud Drive for sync purpose. If you need more controlable and more stable you can use Git a tool that requires some IT technical skills. DoMemo integrates this powerful engine and does a lot of automated logic sometimes you can barely notice Git running in DoMemo but you re already using it. Voice Rocording Taking Note Efficiently DoMemo allows you to record audio and insert it into notes and you can convert the voice into text too. Voice is great as an input method and once you get used to it it can be very efficient. And don t worry about privacy issues because everything is powered by the machine learning capability of your current device iPhone or iPad . And it works just as well without a network.

Inclr s patented mindmapping app helps you organize your tasks apps and life into information clusters the same way your mind works. Save whatever you want the way you want it. Create your own beautiful second brain. We ve created an intuitive tool that does the work of 10 apps. To recall anything from memory our brain works better with visual information rather than text. Using Inclr your brain will be trained to recall data better using our patented visual structure. You will be able to access the information you need more easily and naturally whilst improving data cognition and retention.

Works as a file manager information cluster. Very useful for visual planning Quickly recall anything thanks to the power of visualization Keep similar kinds of information in one place for easy access. For example: keep all social media links in one inclr using different nodes. Build a memory mansion or a second brain each inclr is a part of your life visualized spatially and graphically to create an emotional imprint. It s like recreating your memories on paper Organize anything from work projects writing ideas to grocery lists and budgeting. Be more productive in every aspect of life through easy and effective organizing. HOW IT WORKS: Inclrs are graphical information clusters for visually storing data. Inclrs are themed and customised to create emotional impressions for effective memory retrieval. Rotating nodes are like sub folders which contain content. By using touch to spin the nodes you also train your muscle memory to increase data retention and improves focus. You can add as many inclrs as you want and attach as many nodes as you need. For example suppose you are a writer who is working on a new novel and you need to create different characters with different characteristics. You can create an inclr with the name of the novel and add a node for each character. You can then add images notes sketches in every node and create complete characters. The same can be done for any purpose e.g. business plan travel plan daily task literally anything. Inclr supports all file types and you can open them from within the app!

1530965242,0,Metion Markdown Notes,Productivity,2020-11-04,2020-11-04,82.49,28.0,0,0,1,Metion is a notebook tool that focuses on the writing experience uses Markdown as basic text syntax. Build Your Own Knowledge Base Metion 2.0 brings a new feature named Knowledge Base the plain text syntax then becomes mindmap trees or connected as a network... The Writing Experience is So Important Our goal is to create a great writing experience specially for iPadOS although it s not easy. Metion provides a relatively complete keyboard shortcuts support. After a keyboard connected both iPad and iPhone can archive a huge improvement in writing experience. We also have redesigned the Zen Mode on iPad a more focusing writing mode. It is very very beautiful choosing a suitable background image selecting the white noise you like in Zen Mode and the irrelevant UI elements are hidden. Writing is a pleasure writing is talking to the world writing is your Zen. Data Freedom Open Filesystem Git Built in Metion based on the open filesystem no need to create another new format for storing data. An article is a plain text file and the images in the article are also under a certain folder. Data freedom and open filesystems allow us to synchronize data across devices using iCloud or Git. If you have a higher requirement for data security you can also make a backup very quickly by copying the entire folder working directory . One more thing Metion has a built in support named history version that provides a little more reliability for your documents. Also if you know how to use Git you can try Git to sync. Yes! We have the powerful Git as a built in feature! Optimized for iPad Pro Also for iPhone We tried the best to make Metion optimized for iPad Pro when writing on iPad Pro by Metion the iPad is a really more productive device. Metion is also optimized for the iPhone too. In recent years most of the new iPhones have notch at the top of screen. Metion does not simply avoid the safe area but makes a lot of technical efforts to apply every pixel on the screen as far as possible. If using the visual theme of Dark the notch sometimes look like disappeared like the next generation of full screen phone comes. The Exporting of Metion If using Metion to export as PDF we suggest the theme of PDF can be set as Printer in Settings Panel. If there is a real printer connected in current local network just print directly it will be pretty when words on the real paper. Document in Metion can be exported as image which is optimized for mobile device iPhone . We can set text and QR Code signature at the end of exported image. Send it to friends through some social Apps. The beautiful layout of text can highlight the value of your words. Metion can analyze the structure of current article automatically then export it as Mindmap with one tap only.

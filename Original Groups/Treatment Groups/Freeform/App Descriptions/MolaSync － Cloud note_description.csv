Customer Reviews Really good surprise by Artunczorlu Version 1.0.2 Aug 10 2013 I wasn t aware of this app until now when first looking in the appzapp without looking in the details it s feel like another empty unnecessary note app with Dropbox sync that s what I imagine it but I give it a shot open up and looking for a minute or so it was really great surprise. As an university student who takes note with iPad.This look promising vector drawing PDF annotation Web clipping I would like to see an docs shelf and maybe performance tweak would be great. Using status bar empty space for naming to notes is cool too. Great user experience by Proteusca Version 1.0.2 Aug 15 2013 A powerful design tool.

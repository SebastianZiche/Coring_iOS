1624344916,0,DoMemo Simple Notes System,Productivity,2022-09-17,2022-09-17,53.22,3,0,0,1,A New Balance A typical note is more words and complex a typical memo is less wordy and sometimes ad hoc and much lighter too. We found that there is a new balance between notes and memos also the scenarios that we often encounter such as writing inspirations down or a reverie or the deepest feeling after reading a book. There are not too many words but is not temporary it should be light but also can be complex like giving tags and connections for future management and review. That s why we designed DoMemo this App a new balance a new personal note system. We believe that be simple and be powerful are never contradictory.

Above Simplicity Make Yourself as The Method Notes in DoMemo can have tags or not have backward links or not use Markdown syntax or not cardify or ignore the cards be scientific or humanistic. DoMemo will not deliberately cut down the features to keep the simplicity as a tool it should provide convenience to users without thinking about how to use it. 200 Words The Liberation The default maximum words per DoMemo note is 200 you can adjust it in the App settings. The 200 words limit does not limit human imagination but rather liberates the boundaries of our thinking at another level. Because of this limit when we need to summarize what we have read in a book we will deliberately keep it concise and concise when we take notes as we go we don t need to consider the structure of the context so we really can write freely. When writing become of stress free there will be a magical effect produced simply put it will be easier to write and will write more words finally ...... Local First No Registration Required DoMemo s notes data is stored locally and does not depend on any official servers so you don t have to worry that one day the data service will be unavailable and the notes will not be migrated any more. There is no need to register an account to use DoMemo so you don t have to worry about compromising your account password. DoMemo uses an open file system structure with folders text documents images and audio files so all you need to do to back up or migrate DoMemo data is copy a folder paste it into the location you need in Finder or Filess and it s done. Syncing by iCloud Drive or Git As the designer and developer of DoMemo we don t want to touch users notes data and we believe most of users don t want their data to be hosted by a notes tool provider. It s not just about data privacy and data security but also about the long term life of the notes system from a longer term perspective. That s why DoMemo adopts the principle of local first data. Even if it is local first it can also be synced across devices. DoMemo s notes are synced using iCloud Drive by default. Domemo just simply put an additional copy of each note to be stored on iCloud Drive for sync purpose. If you need more controlable and more stable you can use Git a tool that requires some IT technical skills. DoMemo integrates this powerful engine and does a lot of automated logic sometimes you can barely notice Git running in DoMemo but you re already using it. Voice Rocording Taking Note Efficiently DoMemo allows you to record audio and insert it into notes and you can convert the voice into text too. Voice is great as an input method and once you get used to it it can be very efficient. And don t worry about privacy issues because everything is powered by the machine learning capability of your current device iPhone or iPad . And it works just as well without a network.

App Description
Freenotes is a note-taking application. Download it now and enjoy a natural writing experience instantly.

Just like writing on real paper:
- Realistic Pen Strokes: By combining handwriting pens, you can experience lifelike pen strokes on electronic devices, providing a natural feel for writing on digital platforms.
- Smooth Writing: The handwriting software provides a smooth writing experience, accurately capturing your strokes whether you're sketching or taking detailed notes.

Organize your notes into folders:
- Organized and Neat: The folder feature allows you to categorize and organize your notes by projects, courses, or topics, keeping your note library tidy and orderly.
- Quick Search: No more wasting time searching for specific notes; with the folder function, you can easily find the content you need.
- Paperless Management: The organizing effect that used to require piles of paper can now be effortlessly achieved on electronic platforms.

Annotate PDFs:
- Interactive Learning: Annotate, mark, and highlight directly in PDF files, making learning more interactive and engaging.
- Content Integration: Combine text and handwritten notes to better understand and memorize study materials.
- Digital Reading: No more need to print large quantities of paper documents; annotate PDFs on electronic platforms for truly paperless learning and work.

Enhance learning efficiency:
- Multi-Tasking: The split-screen feature allows you to view different notes, materials, or applications simultaneously, enabling efficient multitasking.
- Course Learning: Display your handwritten or mind map notes alongside course content for a deeper understanding and quick review.
- Meeting Notes: Use the split-screen feature during meetings to record key points in real-time while viewing meeting materials, ensuring you don't miss any important information.

Dark Themes:
- Eye Protection and Comfort: Dark mode adjusts the background color of the app to darker tones, reducing glare and protecting your eyes, allowing you to focus on learning and working for longer periods.
- Nighttime Reading: When reading or taking notes at night, dark mode provides a more comfortable environment without disturbing your own or others' vision.

Customizable Templates:
- Personalized Design: Customize templates according to your personal learning and working style, allowing you to create note formats and layouts that suit your needs.
- Cornell Note-Taking Method: Different learning methods like the Cornell Note-Taking Method and mind mapping can all be found in customizable templates.

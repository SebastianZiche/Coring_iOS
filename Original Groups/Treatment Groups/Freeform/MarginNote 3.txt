Version 3.7 (Jan 18, 2021)
    In this update, we have revamped the mindmap notebooks in MarginNote.
    We have improved idea boxes and renamed them to child mindmaps. We've added a mindmap list interface to better present the child mindmaps and added support for writing directly on the mindmap via Apple PencilKit. Now, each child mindmap looks like an infinitely large paper where you can assign a topic to and take your notes on. Thanks to the mindmap list that we've added, you can now easily switch between different child mindmaps and quickly locate the topic you want. Apple Pencil is no longer limited to writing and drawing: in MarginNote 3.7, you can excerpt text, link your notes, and organize your mindmaps with it. The title-link feature now works with child mindmaps and bookmarked focuses (yes, focuses can now be bookmarked). Thanks to this update, you no longer need to create separate notebooks for your title-link dictionaries. Besides the features mentioned above, we have also added collaboration via iCloud, temporary reference mode to view other files in your database, and many more.

    we also added the following features:
    * Collaboration: in the mindmap menubar, by tapping on the more settings > "Cooperate," you will be able to share a notebook with your friends and work on it with them.
    * Temporary Reference Mode in Search: MarginNote allows searching through all the documents in your database, regardless of whether they are in your current notebook. Previously, if you clicked on the search result from a document that was not in your database, MarginNote would direct you to the notebook that the document was in. With this update, the document would instead be opened as a temporary tab in the document section of your mindmap notebook. If you take no notes from the document, it will be automatically closed after you leave it. If you take some notes from that document, it will be bound to your notebook and become a permanent file in the notebook.
    * Filtering the Cards that Haven't Been Added to the Mindmap: now, you can filter the cards that haven't been added to the mindmap using colors and tags. Through this, you can easily find the important notes that you want to analyze and place them into the mindmap.
    * Universal Occlusion for Highlighting: now, the highlights you make using the highlighter in your documents, mindmaps, and outlines could be used as occlusions in flashcards in review mode.
Version 3.6.19 (Nov 16, 2020)
    Fix the UI problem of iPhone 12 series.
    Fix the PDF cropping issue in the previous version.

    Hope this is the last version before 3.7.
Version 3.6.18 (Nov 15, 2020)

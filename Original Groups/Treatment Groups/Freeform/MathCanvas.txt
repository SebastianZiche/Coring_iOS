App Description
MathCanvas is an innovative application that allows you to calculate, present, and share your technical ideas, designs, notes, and solutions in real time within a document-based application, easy to use, for everyone from students to engineers.



The program features a leading-edge method for inputting equations so they appear as they would in technical documents but allows real-time editing and recalculation. New equations can be inserted freely at any point in the document, and other elements, such as text views, pictures, and drawings can be added at any point to allow you to easily convey your ideas.



The program is backed by a powerful Computer Algebra System (CAS) that finds solutions to even the most demanding technical problems. The mathematic engine features a complete set of advanced functions, featuring scientific and numerical features, as well as the ability to perform symbolic operations.

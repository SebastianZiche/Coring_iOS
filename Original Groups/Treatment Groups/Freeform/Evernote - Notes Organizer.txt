    - The app will now auto-populate new note titles when you tap into the title field. "Sounds cool," we hear you say, "but what does it mean?"

Simply tap in the title field and the app will instantly make that your note's title, without any extra effort on your part. You can change it later if you want, but think of the time you'll save!

Version 10.29 (Mar 16, 2022)

Version 10.28 (Mar 7, 2022)
    Fixed
    - The app would send you an email every time someone shared a note or notebook with you, which was good. But that email would just say you'd received a "chat," which was not so good. So we fixed it to give you the information you need up front.
    - Miscellaneous bug fixes

    New

    Fixed

Version 10.24 (Jan 5, 2022)
    New
    - We heard you! Now see ONLY tasks assigned to you, or tasks you've created that aren't assigned to anyone else, by clicking My Tasks in your Tasks view. That'll make it easier to focus on what you have to get done.
    - We added an icon to make it easier to see which is your default notebook. You'll see it everywhere you would normally select a notebook, such as the notebook list or when moving a note. Hey, it's the little things.
    - We polished things up so it's easier to see the overflow menu (bottom sheet) on your iPad.
    - Your Home dashboard now loads even faster, thanks to some tweaks we made under the hood.

    Fixed
    - When you create a note linked to a calendar event, it contains a blank task to get you started. But those placeholder tasks were also showing up in your Tasks view, which was a big mess. So we fixed it.
    - You can now tap a link in a task to open a note in Evernote. That'll make it easier for you to pick up right where you left off.
Version 10.23.1 (Dec 15, 2021)
    New
    - You can now see your tasks grouped by: Assigned by me, Assigned to me, Assigned to others, and Unassigned. That'll make it easier to stay on top of things.

    Fixed
    - URLs in the Tasks view weren't opening when you tapped on them. We fixed that.
Version 10.23 (Dec 9, 2021)
    New
    - You can now see your tasks grouped by: Assigned by me, Assigned to me, Assigned to others, and Unassigned. That'll make it easier to stay on top of things.

    Fixed
    - URLs in the Tasks view weren't opening when you tapped on them. We fixed that.
Version 10.22 (Dec 2, 2021)
    New
    - We increased the maximum length of a task title from 300 characters to 1000. That's *checks notes*... 700 more characters for you to make use of.
    - We polished some things under the hood to make the Flagged, Due Date, and Assigned tabs in the Tasks view a little zippier.

    Fixed
    - Fix for an occasional crash after selecting a search filter
    - Resolved an issue with the note snippet appearing cut off if the note contained both Tasks and emojis
    - Fixed an issue where clipped images wouldn't always display right away
Version 10.21 (Nov 11, 2021)
    New

    - We're pretty proud of the background images we provided for Home (after all, we took those photos ourselves!). But you might prefer to see more widgets and not have a background image instead. Now the choice is yours when you tap Customize.
    - You can now assign tasks to anyone with an email address—even if they're not an Evernote customer. They'll see them on a special web page where they can mark (and unmark them) as complete without having to create an account.

    Fixed

    - Fixed an issue where the 'Save' button was occasionally unresponsive when trying to save a camera note
    - Fixed an issue where the web clipper would sometimes fail when attempting to share from Photos app
Version 10.20 (Oct 27, 2021)
    New
    - Search just got smarter! If you're in a notebook or space and click into the search bar, the app will start your search in that notebook or space by default.
    - When you filter your tags, you can now choose whether or not to include any child tags (the ones nested under a main tag) as well. Because even though we all love children, sometimes they just get in the way.
    - You can now reveal and edit an encrypted block of text without permanently decrypting it first. The text will be re-encrypted as soon as you navigate to a different note, so your sensitive data stays hidden.

    Fixed
    - Sometimes, if you closed a note and then reopened it, the edit button would disappear. But things should be back to normal now.
    - The Assigned tab in the Tasks view wasn't grouping your tasks by who they were assigned to. That was disappointing, but on the bright side, we fixed it.
    - We spotted a rare bug that may have been preventing you from adding a due date to a task from within a note. It should be smooth sailing now, though.
    - If you marked a task as complete from the Tasks view, the due date, reminder, and assignee would disappear. That wasn't very helpful, so we fixed it.
Version 10.19 (Oct 13, 2021)
    New
    - When you take a picture in Evernote, the app can now also save a copy to your device's camera roll.
    - To help you find what you're looking for even quicker, you'll now see a list of suggested filters at the top of the note list after you perform a search or add a filter.
    - We've improved how the app handles hyperlinks in tasks, so you can tap on more links in more places, and do more with them. For example: URLs in task titles, and links in tasks within a note. There's a whole lot more, but you get the idea.
    - If you're in the By Due Date tab in the Tasks view, tasks in each section are now sorted by due date, so it's easier to see what you need to work on first.
    - We made some changes to the way the app handles dragging-and-dropping and copying-and-pasting files between apps. Because it's important to play well with others.

    Fixed
    - Occasionally, not every image you scanned into Evernote would be saved. That was a big fail, but thankfully it's now a thing of the past.
    - We tinkered with the note editor to iron out a few annoying bugs that were buzzing around.
    - Occasionally, the app would crash when you tapped on a URL. That was kind of embarrassing, but on the bright side, we fixed it.
    - We took careful aim and blasted a few Calendar bugs into the cosmic void.
    - Occasionally, Chinese or Japanese words would disappear from a note. Thankfully, that's a thing of the past now.
Version 10.18 (Sep 23, 2021)
    New
    - We've trained the app to be better at recognizing links in your notes. Now it'll automatically convert web URLs, phone numbers, and email addresses to clickable links; and links can also open local files and default apps (we're looking at you, Zoom). You don't even have to include the "https://"!

    Fixed
    - Occasionally, the app would crash when you tapped on a URL. That was kind of embarrassing, but on the bright side, we fixed it.
Version 10.17 (Sep 14, 2021)
    New:
    - Big news: You can now add codeblocks and dividers to your tables!
    - We're making Home even more useful for you. Notes, tasks, tags, and notebooks widgets now have an icon at the top-right so you can create a new entry with one click, right from the widget.


    Fixed:
    - The app will now continue recording audio after your device auto-locks, even if you have a passcode enabled.
Version 10.16 (Aug 25, 2021)
    New
    - New widget alert! Make your Home dashboard even more useful by adding the new Filtered Notes widget. See the content you really need, such as all notes with a task, all notes with a reminder due today, and much more. All in one place. (Available with Evernote Personal, Professional and Teams plans.)

    Fixed
    - Filtering your view to show notes containing tasks would only show you notes you had already deleted. That wasn't very helpful, since you probably deleted them for a reason, so we fixed it.
    - Tapping on "Go to note" from the tasks detail screen wouldn't actually take you to the note. That was a bit embarrassing, but it's now a thing of the past.
    - Notes no longer show up in your tasks list once the last task in them has been completed. They'll still be in your note list, but now it's easier to see what you still need to do.
    - Miscellaneous bug fixes
    - Stability and performance improvements
Version 10.15 (Aug 12, 2021)
    New
    - We made some adjustments under the hood to improve web clipping on iOS. Clips now sync in the background, and the whole experience is faster and more stable.
    - Show your notebooks some love. Swipe right on a notebook in the list to unlock more menu options or download it for offline access.

    Fixed
    - We tweaked some things under the hood to make Tasks even more useful for you.
Version 10.14 (Jul 28, 2021)
    Fixed
    - If you're not a fan of Dark Mode, you might have noticed that the color of the 'Add' button in Shared with Me was a little... dark. Things should be back to normal now, though.
    - The search results screen used to jump when you were scrolling through it. This was less than ideal, but on the bright side, we fixed it.
    - Now and then, your avatar icon would appear cut off in the Share dialog. Since the only thing you want clipped is a web page, we fixed that.
    - We squashed a rare bug that was causing the app to crash when accessing Tasks.
    - If you left a shared notebook containing tasks, all your tasks would disappear, not just those that had been shared with you. Admittedly, this was a bit of an overreaction, but on the bright side, we fixed it.
    - The app sometimes wouldn't allow you to move a task to a different note from the details screen, but you should be off to the races now.
    - The app would sometimes send you a reminder notification before the time you had set, but now that's a thing of the past.

    Early access to Tasks has started rolling out and will be available to you over the coming weeks.

    Tasks in Evernote help you stay on top of it all by making your notes more actionable and giving your to-dos the context you need.

    Notes and tasks make each other more useful:

    - Add tasks directly to your notes to keep the things you need to do with the information you need to get them done.
    - Streamline your workflow—when notes and tasks live together, there’s no need to keep switching between your notes and a dedicated task manager.
    - Avoid information overload by capturing the details, actions, and decisions you need in one convenient place.

    Take control of your day:

    - See the right task, at the right time. Unlike standard checklists, you can set due dates and reminders on each of your tasks.
    - Get alerts for tasks even when you’re not in Evernote, so important action items never fall through the cracks.
    - Quickly focus on what matters most by flagging important tasks.

    Master your priorities:

    - Get a summarized view of everything you need to do, or immerse yourself in the context of what you need to do now.
    - Work your way—sort tasks by note, due date, or flagged status and use filters to focus on what you need in the moment.
    - Changes to your tasks update instantly across every view and on all your devices.

    Get early access to Tasks and start each day confident that you have a clear path to tackling everything on your plate.
Version 10.10 (May 25, 2021)

    - Evernote Business customers can now search inside shared notes.


    Fixed:
    - The app would sometimes crash if it was open for a long time in offline mode. But now it'll wait patiently for you.
    - Notes would sometimes take too long to open, but now that's a thing of the past.
    - If you zoomed in on a note, the app would sometimes carry over that zoom setting to your next note. But every note is unique, so we put a stop to it.
    - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

    Coming Soon:

    Fixed:
    - The app would occasionally crash when you tried to print something. Now there’s nothing stopping you.
    - Selecting “Larger text” in your phone’s Accessibility settings meant that some Evernote menu items would be cut off. That defeated the whole purpose of using larger text, so we fixed it.
    - Notes would sometimes flash while you were scrolling through them in Card view. Very annoying, but now a thing of the past.

Version 10.0.4 (Oct 8, 2020)
    Welcome to the new Evernote for iOS! We’ve rebuilt the app from the ground up to make it easier for you to create notes quickly, customize them however you like, find them in an instant, and take them wherever you go.


    Editor

    - You now have more control over your notes’ appearance. Use semantic headers and tables to give structure to your notes. Or change fonts, colors, and highlights to add a personal touch.
    - Checklists now get the VIP treatment they deserve. You can add list items, indent them, move them around—and enjoy the satisfaction of crossing them off with a single tap.
    - Adding rich content (like audio, photos, attachments, and sketches) is quicker and easier with the new, multi-function Insert button.
    - We redesigned the formatting toolbar to put your most-used options front and center. Bold/italic/underline, header level, font sizes and colors, multiple highlighter options, subscript/superscript, alignment, hyperlinking, and more—all right there at your fingertips.


    Search

    - Save time—and taps. Get real-time search suggestions as you type to find what you're looking for faster.
    - Filter your searches by tag, attachment, PDF, URL, and more. So even the most elusive notes will now appear at your command.
    - Is searching your Evernote superpower? Like to combine keywords, tags, or locations to find exactly what you need? Now you can save those searches and use them over and over again with just one tap.


    UI

    - The main screen has a cleaner, more modern look, so it’s easier on the eyes—and easier for you to get stuff done.
    - We redesigned the document scanner to streamline how you capture information with your camera. In a flash, the app now automatically recognizes documents, Post-it(R) notes, whiteboards, or business cards, scans them for readable text, suggests the best options for capturing them, and adds them to your notes. Ta da!
    - We’ve introduced nested tags to give you even more ways to organize and find information.


    Foundation

    - This update moves the app to a new codebase that’s more stable and reliable, for fewer hang/crash errors.
    - That new codebase means we can fix bugs quicker and release new features more often (yep, we’ve got some cool things already in development—join our Beta Program for a sneak peek!).
    - Syncing data across different platforms and devices is smoother and more seamless than before.

    This is a big update that we’re really proud of—and it’s just the start. We’re going to keep working hard, releasing updates, and finding new ways to simplify your life.

    - We’ve introduced nested tags to give you even more ways to organize and find information.


    Foundation

    - This update moves the app to a new codebase that’s more stable and reliable, for fewer hang/crash errors.
    - That new codebase means we can fix bugs quicker and release new features more often (yep, we’ve got some cool things already in development—join our Beta Program for a sneak peek!).
    - Syncing data across different platforms and devices is smoother and more seamless than before.

    This is a big update that we’re really proud of—and it’s just the start. We’re going to keep working hard, releasing updates, and finding new ways to simplify your life.
Version 8.24.6 (Jun 4, 2020)
    Fixed:

    Fixed:
    We came; we saw; we conquered bugs.
Version 8.24.4 (Mar 25, 2020)

    We came; we saw; we conquered bugs.
Version 8.24.3 (Dec 18, 2019)
    New:

    Fixed:

Version 8.24.2 (Nov 7, 2019)
    New:
    Dark mode in Evernote is now set through system settings in iOS 13

    Fixed:
    We came; we saw; we conquered bugs.
Version 8.24.1 (Oct 10, 2019)
    New:
    Dark mode in Evernote is now set through system settings in iOS 13

    Fixed:
    We came; we saw; we conquered bugs.
Version 8.24 (Sep 20, 2019)
    New:
    -Remember when you were a kid, anxiously counting down the days until your birthday? That’s how we feel waiting for iOS 13. For now, we’re busy tweaking the app to get ready for all the cool new features.
Version 8.23 (Aug 21, 2019)
    Fixed:
    - Occasionally, images you'd captured with your device's camera wouldn’t show up when you opened a note. They were there all along, but now you’ll be able to see them too.
    - We also fixed some specific issues that were causing the app to misbehave.
Version 8.22 (Jun 24, 2019)
    Fixed:

    - Bug fixes and performance improvements = the name of our new band.
Version 8.21 (Jun 11, 2019)
    Improved

    - If the app seems a little zippier now, it’s not your imagination. We made some tweaks so your notes will load faster.
    - We take data security very seriously, so we made some updates to keep your information even more secure.

    Fixed

    - If you share a note with more than two people, you can now see all their email addresses on the share screen. That’ll help avoid any awkward sharing accidents.
    - Photos you add using the camera icon will now appear in chronological order. So “Wedding 2019” will appear after “Spring Break 2015”. Just like real life.
    - 'Unlock with Face ID’ will now let you create a photo note using 3D Touch. It didn’t do that before, which went against the whole spirit of ‘unlock.'
    - When you created an offline notebook, you sometimes got a message saying “Notebook downloading.” Was it downloading anything? No, but it won’t say that anymore.
Version 8.20 (Apr 24, 2019)
    - It was a day like any other. Until you tried to create a note in a shared notebook, and the app suddenly crashed. You fell to your knees, pounded your fists on the floor, and cried out in despair, “Whyyy? Why, in the name of all that is good and decent, can’t they just fix that?” We’ve got great news: we fixed that.
Version 8.19.1 (Apr 5, 2019)
    Bug fixes and miscellaneous improvements
Version 8.19 (Mar 21, 2019)
    Fixed:
    - Fix for app crash when switching between multiple accounts
    - Fix for app crash when searching through shared notebooks
Version 8.18 (Mar 8, 2019)
    Improved:
    - Tired of waiting to load and search your offline notebooks? We hear you. That’ll all happen much quicker now.
    - Dark Mode is seriously awesome, and it’s getting better every day. For example, your handwritten notes might have been a little hard to see, but not anymore.

    Fixed:
    - Sometimes there was a screen glitch when you reopened the app. So we just went ahead and fixed the glitch. Problem is solved from your end.
    - Occasionally, some of the formatting icons would just up and disappear while you were editing. Which was not helpful in the slightest.
    - Are you someone who creates huge offline notebooks? Worried about them not downloading fast enough? Well it won’t be a problem now.
Version 8.17.3 (Jan 10, 2019)
    You told us you love Templates, so we’ve made it even easier for you to use them. Now you can view our gallery of templates—plus any you’ve saved—right inside the app. Just click on the “Template” button when you create a new note to see them all. Oh yeah, you know we’re doin’ our happy dance.

    FYI, they look great with Dark Mode too.
Version 8.17.2 (Dec 18, 2018)
    Improved:
    - You said you love Dark Mode, so we’re polishing it up to make it even better.
    - Now you can double tap your Apple Pencil to quickly switch between tools in Ink and Skitch.

    Fixed:
    - If you’re wondering why the app was asking for your Apple ID, so were we. But it’s all in the past now.
    - Sometimes viewing lists of notes, tags, and notebooks would cause the app to crash, which was kind of embarrassing. But it should be smooth sailing now.
    - Using the passcode lock would sometimes sign you out of your account. It’s secure, but we’ll admit it was a bit of an overreaction.
    - The navigation sidebar was covering your device’s clock, which was not helpful. What time is it? Time to fix that!
Version 8.17.1 (Nov 28, 2018)
    Various tiny fixes to stop crashes and catch bugs.
Version 8.17 (Nov 15, 2018)
    New!
    * You asked for a dark mode in Evernote, and it’s finally here! Welcome to the dark side—lightsabers not included.
    * Small optimizations in registration experience

    Fixed
    * We fixed some specific issues that might have been getting in your way, like printing weirdness, images that didn’t attach properly, and misbehaving cursors. We agree they were annoying, but it should be smooth sailing now.
Version 8.16.6 (Nov 2, 2018)
    New:
    • Are blank notes getting you down? Say hello to templates. Now, when you create a note, you can format it with one of 30+ templates. Stay tuned for more.
    • We’ve added support for Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12 to make Evernote even more flexible! You can now create custom voice commands to: view a note, notebook, space, or saved search; create a new camera note or audio note; copy a note link to the clipboard; or print the current note. Whew!
    Fixed:
    • If you were using split view on iPad, dragging an image into a note would make it scroll to the top, which was super annoying. Now the cursor will stay right where you left it.
    • Somewhere along the way, the app forgot how to save reminders that didn’t have a due date. But now everything is back the way it used to be.
    • We had an issue where you could see the note list or last note after you reloaded the app, even if the passcode lock was enabled. That was a big fail, but we fixed it.
    • Adding images to a note in a joined notebook would sometimes cause a crash, but no more.
Version 8.16.5 (Oct 26, 2018)

Version 8.15.1 (Aug 16, 2018)
    New:
    • Notice anything different about us? We’ve updated our look to reflect our renewed purpose: helping you focus on what matters most. You’ll see a new design style, color palette, and fonts—we even gave our elephant a makeover!
    • Now there’s one easy place to find everything that’s been shared with you, including notes and notebooks. It’s called “Shared with Me,” and you can find it in the Notebook list right under “Reminders.” We think you’ll love it.

    Experiment:
    • We’re testing a new, quicker way for you to take pictures and add photos in Evernote. Let us know what you think!

    Fixed:
    • Logging out of multiple accounts on the iPad sometimes caused a crash. That was a bit of an overreaction, but on the bright side, we fixed it.
    • Sometimes, double-tapping an open note on your iPad would make the app hang. Things should be back to normal now though.
    • The context feature wasn’t giving you as many results on iOS as it did on other platforms. That really wasn’t fair but we’ve cleared things up.
    • We fixed an issue where images you drew in the Windows version didn’t look right on iOS. Because shouldn’t we all just get along?
    • We gave the app a speed boost for iPad. Note snippets were refreshing every time you edited a note, which was a bit excessive. But it’s all under control now.

Version 8.14 (Jul 17, 2018)
    New:
    • Now you can use Siri to set reminders in Evernote. Try “Hey Siri, remind me to leave work at 5PM in Evernote.” Yep, our integration just got even more awesome.
    • We’ve polished things up with a few design tweaks, so it’s easier to focus on your notes.

    Fixed:
    • When you scrolled through your list of tags, the keyboard would stop you from seeing all the way to the bottom. Bad keyboard! Very bad!
    • If you had a lot of notes on your iPhone X (and we mean A LOT!), scrolling through the whole list would sometimes cause the app to crash. And that’s no way to treat a power user, is it?
    • When you opened a note from the suggested search results, you could play an audio file but the controls were missing. Now you’re back in the driver’s seat.
    • If you copied and pasted a table from Excel, it would show up as an image that you couldn’t edit. The only constant in life is change, so we fixed that.
    • Split View is great on the iPad, but closing and reopening Evernote would sometimes cause a note to disappear. Since disappearing is only good if you’re a magician, we squashed that bug.
    • Sometimes the keyboard wouldn’t pop up if you were trying to share and edit a note. Things should be back to normal now though.
    • Your photos would stop uploading to a note as soon as you clicked Done. That’s probably not what you wanted, so now they’ll quietly upload in the background.
    • When you locked your iPad in landscape mode, the Evernote camera wouldn’t stay with you. That made your pictures look weird, so we fixed the glitch.
Version 8.13.2 (Jul 11, 2018)
    Numerous bug fixes and improvements
Version 8.13.1 (Jun 22, 2018)
    Numerous bug fixes and improvements
Version 8.13 (Jun 8, 2018)
    Experiments:
    • We’re trying out some suggestions when you’re setting reminders to make them faster and easier to use for all of those tasks, to-dos, and projects.
    • We’re shaking things up by placing the icons for tags and reminders on top of the note editing toolbar, so organizing your notes and setting reminders is always top of mind.

    New:
    • We’ve made some improvements to search and you can now sort by relevance, so you can see the things that are, well, more relevant to what you’re looking for.
    • You now have the power to annotate HEIC files. (In case you’re not up on the lingo, it’s the format sorcery Apple uses to make their images higher quality yet smaller in size.)
    • In your settings, you now have the option to turn auto-add location on or off as you please.

    Fixes:
    • If you had a lot of offline notebooks, sometimes that slowed you down when you were creating or loading notes. But we fixed that, so you should be off to the races now.
    • When you tried to drag and drop from other apps, your note would suddenly (and annoyingly) scroll the top. Now things will stay put.
    • You connected Evernote and LinkedIn and were happily scanning business cards, but the profile photos of your contacts weren’t appearing. Which really got in the way of the whole ‘putting a face to the name’ thing.
    • We’ve made changes so that notes will not be shown in iMessage or the iOS widget when pin lock is enabled.
    • We’ve also fixed some of the specific issues that were causing the app to crash.
Version 8.12 (May 18, 2018)
    New:
    - If your bluetooth headphones also have a microphone (*cough* Apple AirPods *cough*), you'll be happy to know you can now use them to record audio into Evernote.
    - Good news for Premium and Business customers: You love the Context feature, so we've brought it back. Reunion tour!
    - We've tweaked the note list view so you always know where you are (and when). Now, the month and year stays pinned helpfully at the top as you browse your notes. Or if you use the scrollbar, a box automagically appears so you can leap from month to month like a gazelle.
    - We've cleaned up the sharing menu to make it easier for you to share your notes and generate links so other people can view them. The previous options are still there too, we just brought the good stuff to the front. Let us know what you think!

    Fixed:
    - You may have been getting an error message when you tried to view your recent notes in the widget. That's probably not what you were hoping for, but we've fixed it now.
    - When you looked at a note's preview in the note list, any bullets you had would appear above the text, not next to it where you'd expect. Weird, right? It all looks good now though.
    - We took care of some of the top sync and copy & paste issues that were getting in your way.
Version 8.11.1 (Apr 21, 2018)
    Experiments:
    - We’re mixing things up with the tab bar by testing a few new options, so be sure to let us know your thoughts!

    Fixed:
    - When sharing notebooks, there was a problem with selecting the right account in the suggest list, but it’s now a thing of the past.
    - When you clipped notes, it unfortunately sometimes created duplicates, proving that twice isn’t always as nice. But we’re now back to the normal state of one clip, one note.
    - The app would crash after sharing a note via Work Chat, but we’ve fixed that now. Because nothing should stand in the way of sharing a great idea.
    - Sometimes the content of your note simply wouldn’t load. But we’ve cleared things up, so it should be nothing but smooth sailing and speedy loading from here.
    - Sometimes tapping on an attachment in a note wouldn’t open it. All attachments should now open correctly, as you would expect.
    - Various other tiny fixes to stop crashes and catch bugs.

    Fixed:

    Web clips will now always appear in a note when viewed—as you’d expect.

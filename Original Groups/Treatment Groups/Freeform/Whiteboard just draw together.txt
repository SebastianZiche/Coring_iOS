Business (Applications)

App Description
A clean whiteboard and several basic colors, just draw together. Simple, easy, focused and fun.

I made this app as a prototype for a larger app I was working on, to my delight my kids LOVED it. They use this whenever they want to draw instead of the other drawing apps we already had.

I think they love it so much because there's no extra stuff to get in the way, they can just be totally immersed in drawing.

So I decided to release it to the App Store and let others try it out too. I appreciate your support.

Features:
* Draw anything you want with the colors of the rainbow.
* Draw together with friends and family using the Messages app. Just send a drawing to a friend and they can open it and draw on it too and then send it back.
* 6 convenient preconfigured marker sizes
* Undo, Redo, and Clear drawing actions
* Special "Rainbow" marker lets you draw with a rainbow!!! you gotta try it!
* Change the background color by long pressing on one of the colors
* Remembers your last used marker color and size and your canvas color.
* Import photos to trace, annotate, and have fun with
* Shake to erase
* Save your drawings to your Photos library
* Print your drawings to AirPrint enabled printers
* Share your drawings with Messages, Mail, and many more
* Tip Jar allows you to provide financial support to further development of Whiteboard.

Whiteboard Labs Features (early stage features you can opt-in to try)
* Draw with Knobs - draw pictures using knobs the old school way!
* Screen Recording - record the screen and audio as you draw, save or send the recording to friends and family.
* Infinite Canvas - add more pages to your canvas as you draw
* Draw with Motion - tilt your device to draw a picture

My goal is to make the funnest and easiest to use drawing app for kids. I improve Whiteboard with your reviews, feedback, and financial support. If you or someone you know, enjoys using Whiteboard:

• Please leave a tip in the Tip Jar

Version 1.0.2 (Sep 30, 2019)
    Thanks for using Whiteboard and for all the great feedback and reviews! In this version I focused on responding to App Store review feedback about not knowing how to create new drawings and also more feedback from 3 year old daughter, that the Notification Center was getting in her way too much.

    Here's what's new in this version:

    Added:
    * A new friendly helper screen about how to start new drawings

    Fixed:
    * swiping from edges of the screen no longer opens notification center or control center automatically

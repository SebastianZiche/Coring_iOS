App Description
Miro is a visual workspace for innovation that enables distributed teams of any size to dream, design, and build the future together. With the magic of Miro, visualizing concepts, ideas, and solutions as a team can happen anywhere — no dry erase markers needed. Sync, flow, and feel the connection of working side by side with your team — even in remote, distributed, or hybrid work environments.

The Miro app for iPad and iPhone gives you the tools to collaborate with boards that put projects and context all in one place.

Our customers love using Miro to:

• Run online meetings and team workshops
• Brainstorm new ideas and designs on a limitless board
• Edit, annotate and mark up documents and PDFs
• Take digital notes with an Apple Pencil (and reduce paper use!)
• Easily collect resources, photos, docs, links, and references
• Plan and manage agile workflows and scrum rituals
• Create user journeys, map processes, and develop personas
• Teach and facilitate interactive classes in a collaborative space
• Create a vision board of ideas and inspiration

Miro allows you to create anytime, anywhere. With over 200+ pre-made templates, a drag-and-drop interface, and no limit on collaborators, working on a Miro board is fast and fun.


With Miro’s mobile app, you can:

• Scan paper post-it notes and convert them into editable digital notes
• Create, view, and edit all your boards
• Capture and organize your ideas on the go
• Share boards publicly or invite team members to edit
• Upload images, pictures, docs, spreadsheets, and more
• Share boards and invite team members to edit
• Review, add and resolve comments


On tablets, you can also use Miro to:

• Draw concepts and sketch new design ideas with an Apple Pencil
• Convert pencil or stylus drawings into shapes, notes, and diagrams
• Set up your tablet as the second screen with Zoom or Microsoft Teams
- Create Mind Maps to visualize your ideas
• Use Lasso to select and move sketches, drawings, or text anywhere on the board
• Use Highlighter to capture the attention of your team during a meeting

App Description
Educreations is a unique interactive whiteboard and screencasting tool that's simple, powerful, and fun to use. Annotate, animate, and narrate nearly any type of content as you explain any concept. Teachers can create short instructional videos and share them instantly with students, or ask students to show what they know and help friends learn something new.

INSTRUCTION THAT'S READY WHENEVER YOU ARE
Finished lessons are stored securely in your online Educreations account, so they're available whenever and wherever you need them. You control who sees what. Even if something happens to your iPad, all of your videos are safe.

DESIGNED FOR THE DIGITAL CLASSROOM
Create classes that students can join right within the app. Lessons sync automatically between teacher and student iPads, so it's easy for students to access teacher instruction and for teachers to monitor student work. Students without iPads can access classes and lessons on the Educreations website.

SHARE INSTANTLY
Lessons can also be shared via link, email, Messages, Facebook, Twitter, or by embedding them on your blog or website. Upgrade to Pro to export your videos to the Camera Roll, open them in other apps, and use them in other video projects.

    If you are installing for the first time or upgrading from version 1.1 or older, you can go ahead and install 1.2.1 without any problems.

    For v1.2 users, we are aware of a bug that will temporarily prevent your saved lessons from playing back properly on the iPad. We have fixed the issue and are waiting for Apple to approve our fix.

    If you've been affected by this bug, fear not! Your saved lessons will begin playing back normally on the iPad when you upgrade to v1.2.2, which will be available shortly. We're very sorry for the inconvenience.

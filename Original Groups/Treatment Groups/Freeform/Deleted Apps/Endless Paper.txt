App Description
Introducing Endless Paper, an all-new kind of app featuring an infinite canvas which lets you take handwritten notes, create immersive art pieces, explore and grow ideas visually, and so much more…
Deliberately simple yet powerful, incredibly fast, Endless Paper is as natural to use as pen & paper without the limitations of physical media.

Whether you are a student taking notes, an artist wanting to explore uncharted territories, or a manager brainstorming on your next project, Endless Paper is a versatile tool to help you think and communicate visually.

HIGHLIGHTS
• A truly infinite canvas
• Ultra-crisp drawings at any zoom factor
• Create vast and expansive universes while occupying a minimal storage footprint
• Bookmarks to quickly navigate your canvas
• Drag and drop pictures from basically any app, including images with transparency
• Broadcast a live version of your canvas to the web
• Unlimited undo and redo
• Data integrity: continuous auto-save coupled with an archiving system
• An interaction model that minimizes error and cognitive load
• Designed and optimized for iPad and Apple Pencil
• Powered by Fractile: Metal-accelerated, 64-bit vector rendering engine

DRAWN BY INFINITY
If you've been itching to know the techniques employed in creating the fascinating infinite zoom videos that are trending on social media, your search is over. Endless Paper's infinite canvas challenges you to think beyond isolated artworks, empowering you to weave an expansive tapestry of interconnected stories told in a new long-form format that extends beyond panels. For the first time ever, artists have the ability to accumulate a lifetime's worth of creations into one cohesive masterpiece. It liberates you from the constraints of traditional media, while still delivering a drawing and painting experience that closely resembles traditional methods.

SPATIAL WHITEBOARD
Have you ever started sketching an idea only to find out you won't have enough room to finish? Problem solved.
But here's the secret perk: Endless Paper let's you organize your content spatially. Everything in its right place. You can focus on the minute details of your project and quickly step back to see the big picture. It gives a sense of place to your work without artificial separation between documents. Every capability available at the document level seamlessly extends to any level. It all just works in a surprisingly consistent way.

DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE, INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
Endless Paper is designed to be natural to use. But this is no purposeless minimalism. Interactions are as simple as possible in order to minimize errors and cognitive load. This lets you dedicate 100% of your brain to the task at hand. Interactions feel second nature, especially important in stressful situations or when you hand over your iPad to someone who has never used the app before.

DESIGNED FOR IPAD AND APPLE PENCIL
The tailor-made Fractile vector rendering engine delivers an unparalleled level of performance: Whenever you are panning, zooming or writing, you always get ultra-crisp, retina quality, vector rendering at a silky smooth 120 fps, even with millions of strokes simultaneously on screen.
Canvases accumulating years’ worth of drawings and notes will open instantly. No sweat.
It all participates in an almost unreal, magical experience.

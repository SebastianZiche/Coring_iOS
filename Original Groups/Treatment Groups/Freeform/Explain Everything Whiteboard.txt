Version 6.9 (Jul 6, 2022)
    New Plans, Better Fit

    Explain Everything has a new subscription plan: Solo Teacher. It is a dedicated, more affordable offer for teachers and educators. It lets them use Explain Everything on their own with no limits. So if you’d like to create videos and have your personal media-powered whiteboard, this one's for you.

    The Solo Teacher plan features unlimited projects with unlimited slides, no restriction to video recording length, and 5 GB of Explain Drive cloud storage. The new plan is a yearly subscription and it comes with a 7-day free trial (if you haven’t used it already).

    Alongside the new plan, we’ve also renamed the Individual plan to Pro. This is to better reflect the difference between the two plans. If you’re already on a paid plan, don’t worry—it will all function as it used to.

    Last but not least, the recording length limit for the Free plan is now 3 minutes. We felt that the previous 1 minute limit was too short to explore the recording possibilities.

    More exciting updates are coming soon! Stay tuned!

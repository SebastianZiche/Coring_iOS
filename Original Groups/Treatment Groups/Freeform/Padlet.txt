App Description
Padlet is a digital canvas to create beautiful projects that are easy to share and collaborate on.

It works like a piece of paper. We give you an empty page - a padlet - and you can put whatever you like on it. Drag in a video, record an interview, snap a selfie, write your own text posts or upload some documents, and voilà! A padlet is born. Make it even more beautiful by choosing custom wallpapers and themes.

Padlet is different from other blogging tools and inspiration boards because it’s flexible. Create a grocery list, a Venn diagram, a discussion board, a group greeting card, a portfolio, or a business plan, all in one app. Used by teachers, students, professionals, and individuals of all ages, all around the world, padlets can be selectively shared and edited among multiple contributors.

Padlet for iPhone takes the Padlet you know and love, and makes it portable. With views tailored for smaller devices and easy-to-use editor buttons, you can change how your padlet looks with a quick tap. Personalize it with selfies. Use our new menu to invite others to view and edit your padlets. Share across social platforms.

ClassKit integration makes it easier for teachers to share and track their students when working on padlets. Teachers can create handouts that include a padlet and then share the assignment to their respective classes. The students are then able to open the padlet from the SchoolWork app and start work on their assignments right away. Teachers will be able to see who has opened the assignment, how long they have worked on the assignment, and whether or not they have completed their work.

Millions of people are already using Padlet for:

Portfolios
Opinion forums
Lesson plans
Bios
Real estate listings
Timelines
Blogs
Q+A
To-Do list
Inspiration board
Writing prompts
Collecting feedback
Collaborative note-taking

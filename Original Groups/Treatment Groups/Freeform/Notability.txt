    This is a major update for Notability!
    - Data detection of various types so you can:
    -- Tap a URL to open it in your web browser.
    -- Tap a date to show it, or to create an event for it in your calendar.
    -- Tap an email address to start a message in your email app, or add contact.
    -- Tap a phone number to dial it, send a message, or add contact.
    -- Tap a street address to open it in Maps, get directions, or add contact.

    - We updated the Scissor tool to include both freehand and rectangular selection methods. Tap the Scissor tool and select the method that suits your purpose. Now you can select and copy any content on a page, and paste it as an image, enhancing your note taking experience by giving you an efficient way to re-use content. For example, if you need more room to annotate a diagram, simply add a blank page, and copy & paste the diagram into it. To Tweet a portion of the page, select it and tap copy, then Share it via Twitter. To Message your selection, copy it, and paste in into Messages.

    A couple of tips — after selecting and copying content, tap the screen to Paste Image. The resulting image can be re-sized and moved, and typing wraps around it. To re-select the image, tap the Typing tool and tap the image. If handwriting is included in the selection, you can scale, rotate, and paste it anywhere, just as before.

    - Recovery of older versions of a note if iCloud syncing is enabled in Notability. To do this, tap and hold a note name in the library.

    - Copy and Paste Notability lists now uses correct format.

    - General bug fixes and improvements.

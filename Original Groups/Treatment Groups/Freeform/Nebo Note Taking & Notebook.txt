App App Store Notes
Our iPad Pro becomes an awesome on-the-fly notepad with this app built specifically for Apple Pencil. With a few taps and strokes, we can format handwritten text as titles, paragraphs, or bulletpoints. And creating diagrams or marking up photos? Dead simple. Ah, the simple joy of taking old-fashioned notes—and decorating the page with random doodles!
App Description
Create beautiful notes and professional documents by hand, sketch ideas on an endless canvas, and annotate PDFs with our dynamic notebook tool. Powered by the world's best AI handwriting recognition, seamlessly mix handwriting, text, drawings, diagrams, and images on the expandable canvas. Edit effortlessly with pen gestures, converting handwriting and shapes to typed text and perfect forms. Redefine your note taking experience with a modern approach - it's more than notes, it's where ideas take shape.

Nebo understands every word you write in your choice of 66 languages, and works on all platforms - so you can access and search your notes from any device.

Enjoy 3 powerful experiences in one app:

** Create freely in a Nebo Note – the world’s most advanced freeform canvas with full write-to-text and shape conversion **
** Handwrite a responsive Nebo Document, adding math and diagram objects as needed **
** Import existing documents as PDFs, ready to annotate **

Version 1.2.1 (Feb 14, 2015)
    - Completely new design optimized for iOS 8
    - Improved sharing and collaboration: work with teammates on any browser and any device
    - COMING SOON: Save your documents for offline viewing

    This is the first release of our new, rewritten app. We know it's been a long time coming, and we're very excited to get it into your hands! You can always reach us at support@lucidchart.com with any questions or feedback, and thanks for being a Lucidchart customer!

    We've completely replaced the old versions of the document list and sharing functionality, as well as the login and signup workflow. It's now much easier to share your documents and folders, quickly find recent items, and search for documents across all your whole account.

    We've made several updates to the editor to make it more stable for your day-to-day use. Even for documents that we don't fully support on the iPad (such as floorplans or certain mockups), you'll be able to see and interact with a view-only version of the document.

    We're just starting work on a brand new editor, and we're working hard to get it in your hands as soon as possible. It's a big project, but this new editor will have a brand new, touch-optimized interface to make editing even faster and more seamless. Don't worry – we'll keep making improvements to the rest of the app while we work on it, so you can expect the app to keep getting even better over the next weeks and months.

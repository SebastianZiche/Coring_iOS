App Description
Write with focus. Open your mind with Minimal, a meditation-inspired notes and writing app.

Minimal combines thoughtful, modern design with powerful features to deliver a spacious, beautiful writing environment.

• Note Lifetime
• Collaborative writing
• Publish notes as websites
• Add Todos to the Calendar app
• Beautiful formatting
• Sync everywhere: Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch

Minimal is a simple yet powerful notes app. Inspired by meditation, nature, and architectural design, Minimal provides a beautiful space to think, write, and organize projects.

NOTE LIFETIME
The Note Lifetime keeps your notebook fresh and reflective of the present moment. When a note goes unedited for a duration you choose in settings, you’ll be gently notified. This is an opportunity to review the note, act on it, or let it go.

COLLABORATIVE WRITING
Share notes with friends, family, and teammates. With a gentle design, writing remains focused and tranquil, even as thoughts merge and ideas multiply. Everyone receives changes as notes evolve, and multiple people can make edits at the same time without conflict.

FOCUSED + SPACIOUS DESIGN
Minimal is designed so only one element is ever in focus. We love the beauty of a blank page – abundant empty space allows for an ease of creative expression.

PUBLISH AS WEBSITE
Transform notes into beautifully-formatted websites in microseconds.

TODO LISTS
Todo lists are an effective way to organize projects and complete tasks. Sync with the Calendar app, get things done, and check everything off.

BEAUTIFUL FORMATTING
Minimal combines Markdown-style formatting with elegant typography. The result is simple, expressive notes that make it easy to think and write.

SYNC EVERYWHERE
Bring focus to your favorite devices. Minimal is designed for Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Cloud Sync is fast, reliable, and invisible.

SHARE, EXPORT, IMPORT
You’re in control of your notes. Share directly in iMessage, export as PDF or HTML, and use the system share mechanism to take notes anywhere. Importing links + prose into Minimal is just as easy.

CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING
The best notebook is personal. We made everything in Minimal customizable, from fonts + themes to sorting notes + note actions. You can also build custom workflows using the Shortcuts app.

A LITTLE GIFT
Wow, thanks for reading. As a little gift for tuning in, these are our favorite musicians -> Somi, Snarky Puppy, and London Grammar. They’re jazzy and introspective, just how we like it. Enjoy.

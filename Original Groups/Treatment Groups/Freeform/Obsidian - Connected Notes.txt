    Core update:

    Includes all new functionality and bug fixes up to Obsidian Desktop v0.13.24.

    This update also allows all new cm6-compatible plugins to run.





    Live Preview:

    While this feature works pretty well already, it hasn't been fully mobile optimized, so there could still be some usability issues when using with a touch-only device, such as editing embeds and code blocks.

    In the meantime, feel free to use Source Mode when that happens. You can do that by long-holding the 3 dot button on the top right and hitting "Toggle Live Preview/Source mode" (or run a command from the pull down menu or bottom toolbar).





    Vim mode:

    Support for vim mode is now available, but must be enabled on a per-device basis on mobile. It is not really usable on a mobile device without an external keyboard.





    Others:

    Drag and drop features from desktop is now generally available across the app, and can be triggered by long-holding items. This includes drag and drop files and folders, starred items, and outline items.

Version 1.0.5 (Nov 8, 2021)
    - Includes all new functionality and bug fixes up to Obsidian Desktop v0.12.19.

    - Improved graph view animations.

    - Heading rename.

    - New theme store.

    - Slash commands.

    - New plugin APIs now available for the latest plugins to use.

    - Tons of bugfixes.

    - Editor

    - Upgrade from CodeMirror 0.18 to 0.19. Should come with many bugfixes and performance improvements.

    - Copy and paste is now handled just like the desktop app.

    - Drag and drop should now work properly on tablets.

    - Obsidian Sync

    - Fixed version history not showing size and device info.

    - Restoring files using version history will no longer error out with "This version is already the latest version".

    - There are now commands for copying, pasting, and opening the context menu, which can be assigned to the toolbar for convenience.





    - The app will now wait for iCloud to sync back configuration files before opening the vault to prevent load failures.

Version 1.0.4 (Aug 7, 2021)
    Improved start up performance.
    Updated functionality to match newest desktop release.

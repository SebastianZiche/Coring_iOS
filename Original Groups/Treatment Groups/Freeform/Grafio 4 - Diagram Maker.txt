App Description
Grafio turns 10. It's been around for a decade already - polished, efficient and with more features than ever before.

Grafio is not a tool for professionals only. Its smooth learning curve allows everyone to convey their ideas visually and with ease. Hundreds of thousands use Grafio worldwide, due to its simplicity and affordability.

There are no ongoing subscription costs or upgrade charges. Once you purchase it, you have access to an ongoing number of libraries (shapes and symbols) and a multitude of new features with every update.

Since Grafio was released 10 years ago, there have been 3 major upgrades, including dozens of new object libraries and a fresh new look to the layout.

To begin, simply draw a rectangle, circle or an ellipse and see what makes drawing with Grafio so easy and fun.  Grafio can recognize and replace any of the shapes mentioned with a perfectly looking one for your diagram or schematic, ready to be used over and over.

Drag and drop objects on the canvas for more complex diagrams. Make connections, add text labels and images.

SHAPE RECOGNITION
The shapes you draw are automatically closed and straightened, all basic shapes are instantly recognized. The lines you draw between shapes are automatically turned into connections thanks to our shape recognition magic.

STENCILS
Some diagrams require more advanced objects. Grafio provides thousands of shapes that you can easily drag in from the library. In addition, you can embed images from your Camera Roll into shapes and connect them to your other shapes.

AUDIO RECORDINGS
Recording audio notes to your shapes can be a way for you to collect your thoughts and include them in the finishing product, or as a reference.

- Video tutorials on Grafio can be found on YouTube:

    In times like this there is nothing better to do than #StayHome and expand your creativity with a cool tool like Grafio.

    We were thinking of ways to give back and we believe Grafio 4.2 is our way to go. Alongside all the cool new features we're bringing to the loyal Grafio users, we decided to throw in a lot of free icon packs such as P&ID, Military and ArchiMate. To bring some more value to your in-app purchases we just added a ton of European and Asian country maps into the Maps & Flags add-on.

    Here's what's new in Grafio 4.2.3:
    * Undo/redo functionality restored, big apologies!

    * Fix for a rare crash that would occur when updating a line's arrow. Thanks go to Hans for reporting it promptly.
    * Potential crash fix related to the sharing process

    * Grafio toolbar now fully supports all possible screen resolutions and orientations including all split screen modes
    * Mode buttons are grouped together and displayed in a more intuitive way
    * Useful shortcut buttons are now available on the toolbar: shape recognition, snap, non-pencil rejection
    * A setting is provided to disable finger and palm input while drawing with Apple Pencil
    * Drawing lines or shapes now produces thicker lines if you press more firmly with the pencil
    * Colors are now stored globally retaining user custom colors across documents
    * Free style lines now behave exactly as other shapes on the canvas
    * Any shape on the canvas can now be filled with color, even unclosed ones
    * Huge new icon pack: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID)
    * New free icon pack: NATO military symbols
    * New free icon pack: ArchiMate symbols
    * Updated maps icon pack: Detailed Asian and European country maps added
    * Shape style popovers no longer behave oddly when selecting other shapes

    Some of the most notable Improvements in 4.0:

    Grafio can now store and sync your documents in the iCloud. Not just iCloud, any cloud service that has an app on your iPad. Exchanging between your devices has never been easier. Plus you're constantly backed up.

    Speed up your creative process - no need to waste time typing shape text. Simply handwrite it using Apple Pencil into any shape on the canvas. Grafio won’t recognise the handwritten script but will duly store it inside. You can always use a fancy typeface later when you’re done with creating the graph.

    A unified document browser that lets you manage your documents locally as well as on supported cloud services such as iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc.

    A precision toolbar to adjust any of your objects' position, rotation and size through numerical values. Flip a shape with just a button, or align and distribute multiple shapes.

    Tons of new free icons - more than 3,000 color and black&white pictograms including activities, places, weather, people, animals, emoticons, electrical symbols, GHS and a lot more.

    Icon search in the library. Now you can find what you need as easy as typing its name into the search box.

    Scaling or rotating a shape now affects the text label inside as well.

    It’s now possible to put arrowheads to any line even if it’s not a connection between shapes.

    It's now possible to rearrange the order in which the shapes appear when exporting a video presentation.

    Amazon Web Services (AWS) icon pack is now up to date

    …and of course many usability and speed improvements under the hood.

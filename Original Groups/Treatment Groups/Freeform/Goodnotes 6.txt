Version 5.7.0 (May 3, 2021)
    Introducing Elements - Save and reuse frequently needed objects across all of your notebooks.

    Stickers, stamps, headers, sticky-notes, basic shapes, graphs, coordinate systems... When taking notes, we need to use the same objects over and over again. The new Elements feature lets you import and save objects or groups of objects to a collection from where you can add them to the page again. No more copy and paste between different notebooks or hectic redrawing when time is short.


    ### SAVING ELEMENTS ###
    GoodNotes comes with some built-in Element collections that you can use to decorate or enhance your notes.
    Of course, you can also add your own elements:
    1. Select something with the Lasso Tool > tap on the selection again > tap “Add as Element”
    2. Select an image with the Image tool > Then tap on it again > Add as Element
    3. Open the Elements picker > tap and hold on the mini thumbnail of a collection at the bottom > “Edit” > Import images from Camera Roll or Files

    ### INSERTING ELEMENTS ###
    Inserting elements work similarly to inserting images with the image tool:
    Select the Elements tool > tap anywhere on the page > select the Element you want to insert.

    You can also use drag and drop to add elements from the Elements picker or from the contextual area that includes your recently used Elements for faster access.

    Tips for Pros:
    When you save an Element, the format is preserved, which means all objects are fully editable when you add them back to a page. For example, you can save a hand-drawn table with placeholder text boxes for the table headers. After adding the Element to the page, you can update the placeholder text with the text tool or erase columns you don’t need.


    ### ORGANIZING ELEMENTS ###
    Elements are organized in collections. When saving an element, you can choose to add it to an existing collection or create a new one. You can delete Elements in collections, move them around, and import more.

    You can learn more about how to use Elements by visiting our blog on medium.goodnotes.com and following us on Instagram (@goodnotes.app) and on Twitter (@goodnotesapp).

    ##Study With Flash Cards
    GoodNotes lets you create flash cards that you can study with the “Spaced Repetition” learning technique.
    - To create a flash card, add a new page using the “Flash Card” paper template
    - Flash card paper is currently only available in the size “GoodNotes Standard Size” and can be found in the Essentials template group all the way on the right side
    - Add the question on the top half and the answer on the bottom half. Tip: Use images, text, and handwriting to create great-looking and information-rich flash cards.
    - To study all flash cards in a document (“the flash card deck”), tap on the ... menu and then on “Study Flash Cards”
    - Tap on the screen to reveal the answer and then choose how easy it was to remember the answer.
    - GoodNotes will suggest your next study date based on your learning progress and the selected difficulty of the cards. The more you study, the more accurate these suggestions will become. E.g.: You will see “hard” cards more often and sooner than “easy” cards.
    - You can reset your entire learning progress for the current deck in the settings in the flash card studying screen. Note that this is not reversible and the entire progress for this deck is lost as if you would have never studied it before.

    - GoodNotes will suggest your next study date based on your learning progress and the selected difficulty of the cards. The more you study, the more accurate these suggestions will become. E.g.: You will see “hard” cards more often and sooner than “easy” cards.
    - You can reset your entire learning progress for the current deck in the settings in the flash card studying screen. Note that this is not reversible and the entire progress for this deck is lost as if you would have never studied it before.

    ## Other fixes & improvements
    - added a dialogue for when there are incompatible sync versions installed that isn’t blocking you from using GoodNotes
    - Fixed crashes related to the new shape and text features
    - Fixed the multi-selection gesture for the library and page
Version 5.6.0 (Sep 24, 2020)
    We're excited to introduce improved shape drawing and updates to the text tool: Draw and hold with the pen and highlighter, support for curves, subsequent shape editing, faster text style selection, text box drop shadow and more. Here's what's new:

    ### Draw and hold
    - Draw a stroke with the pen or highlighter tool and hold down with your finger or stylus at the end of the stroke to convert it to a perfect shape or line
    - Continue holding down and drag your finger/stylus across the screen to resize or rotate the shape
    - This adds back the ability to draw shapes with the highlighter that many of you missed from GoodNotes 4

    ### Select shapes
    - Tap on a shape using your finger or the shapes tool to select it
    - You can now edit it using the points on the lines
    - To resize or rotate a shape use the lasso tool

    ### Draw curves
    - We're introducing curves as a new shape in this update
    - You can change the slope of a curve when editing it

    ### More options for shape drawing
    - You can disable "Draw and Hold" in the pen tool options. Tap on the pen tool icon in the toolbar twice to access them
    - Strokes you draw can snap to other stroke endpoints which allows you to create perfect shapes with multiple strokes. If the shape is closed, it can be selected and edited as a whole instead of only selecting the single lines


    ### New “selected state” for text boxes
    - Tapping on a text box once will select it so that you can make edits to the text box as a whole without bringing up the keyboard right away
    - You can move selected text boxes or change the style easily
    - Double tap on a text box to start typing

    ### New toolbar layout and styles
    - The text tool receives an improved contextual area so that the style options are easier to access
    - A new drop shadow option has been added to the text box style options
    - We updated the FontAPI so that custom system fonts are now visible in GoodNotes 5 on iOS 14

    INTRODUCING SHARED DOCUMENTS

    Finding new ways to work together with other people is now more important than ever. This update adds the ability to share documents with other GoodNotes users and edit them together.

    ## How to share a document
    1. Open a document in GoodNotes and tap on the Share icon
    2. Tap on "Collaborate" and enable "Link Sharing"
    3. Copy the link to your clipboard or send it directly to other people so that they can open it on their iOS & iPadOS devices and accept the shared document

    You can find more information on all new features and instructions on how to use them on goodnotes.com/shared-documents

    ## What you can use shared documents for
    Shared documents are incredibly versatile. Here's some inspiration what you could use them for:
    - Ask someone else to leave comments an annotations on a PDF document you drafted
    - Share notes with your classmates to check if you understood everything from your last lecture correctly
    - Collect signatures or feedback on a document from a group of people
    - Make your meeting notes available to your entire team immediately

    - Correct someone's homework
    - Brainstorm with your team
    - Play Tic Tac Toe or Battleships with friends
    - Plan a home renovation project and even share it with your interior designer to get their feedback

    Changes to shared documents sync via iCloud and take around 15-30 seconds to show up on other devices. Currently, anyone with the link can open and edit a shared document in GoodNotes. We recommend sharing documents with trusted people only.

    Happy sharing!

    OTHER RELEASE NOTES
    - added a page number indicator when scrolling. This can be disabled in Menu > Settings > Document Editing

    This update adds the bookmarks feature from GoodNotes 4, now called “Custom Outlines”.

    ## How to use Custom Outlines ##

    Document outlines allow you to quickly navigate to specific pages in your documents from the Outlines tab in the thumbnail view. 

    You can add pages to the document outline and set a name for them, by following one of the options below:

    1. Tap on the ... button in the navigation bar of an open page and tap "Add this page to Outline"
    2. Open the thumbnail view and tap on the arrow next to the page number and tap "Add Page to Outline"

    You will then be asked to insert a title for the outline item, which will appear next to the page in the thumbnail view and in the outlines tab.
    A page can be added to the outline multiple times, and thus can have multiple labels. 
    To remove an outline item in the Outlines tab, swipe from right to left on the item.

    ## Migrating old bookmarks from V4 to Outline Items ##

    If you migrated your GoodNotes 4 documents to GoodNotes 5, your old bookmarks were converted to "Favorites". You can convert them to Outline items in Menu > Settings > Document Editing. Favorites you added in GoodNotes 5 won't be affected by this conversion.

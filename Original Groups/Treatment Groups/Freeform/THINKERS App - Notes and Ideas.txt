App Description
The THINKERS App helps you do more with your best ideas through easier capture, better organization, and collaborative sharing.

Combined with our THINKERS Notebook, this groundbreaking combo will help you unlock your creativity and ideas - from paper to the cloud.

TESTIMONIALS

"I've looked around at a lot of different apps, and they all do the job of note-taking. But when you're talking about a system that captures and then helps you clarify your notes, I feel like this app might be the wave of the future." -- Patrick G.

"I love the simplicity and flexibility of the app for capturing thoughts and ideas. The ability to simply tag, geotag, share, organize, and then re-locate things that are important to me in a meaningful and customizable way is awesome. I haven't found anything like it in any other application!" -- Jeffrey K.

Let’s break down the key features ...

ONE-CLICK CAPTURE

Capture any type of idea the moment inspiration hits -- no keyboard required.

Just a tap allows you to capture a handwritten idea, an image, a document, an audio recording, a video recording, or even a whiteboard. And you’ll have searchable text and tags all without needing to type.

BETTER ORGANIZATION

You don’t need to fit your style to our app; the app conforms to you. Create your own intuitive folder structure using custom colors and images.

And when you’re looking for that one particular note, search with confidence. Our powerful Smart Search feature will be able to identify your ideas and notes by searchable text and tags you didn’t even have to enter yourself.

HANDWRITING RECOGNITION

Our unique machine learning technology automatically recognizes handwriting so words on a notebook page or whiteboards can be searched in the app. Plus, audio and video notes are automatically transcribed so you can find what was said.

INSTANT TAGGING

Tags are a great way to organize your ideas. And with our built-in ML, hashtags in your notebook are appended to your notes in the app, along with auto-tagging of images. Quickly connect your ideas using our built-in tagging system.

ONE-TAP SHARING

Share individual ideas or entire folders with just a tap. The best part? The person you’re sharing with can access your idea(s) from any device using our custom-built, web-based collaboration interface -- no THINKERS App account required.

And if they want to leave you a comment, it’s right there in the interface. Turn your notifications on and you’ll get notified when comments come in.

But that’s not all …

The THINKERS App also features all of the following:

** Widgets for your phone including Quick Capture, Recent Comments, and Last Note Taken.

** Secure cloud storage you can count on.

** Optional cloud sync with your favorite third-party provider (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) (Requires Subscription)

** Location awareness (once you enable) that appends location info to your notes.

** An interactive “My Nearby Notes” map so you can have a spatial view of your ideas.

SUBSCRIPTION OVERVIEW & TERMS

No subscription is required to capture pages from your THINKERS Notebook.

If you would like to unlock the advanced features of the app - including capturing photos, documents, audio/video, whiteboards, text, and advanced data sync - then you will need a subscription.

Start your subscription with a free 7-day trial.

Once the trial is over, you’ll be charged a subscription fee based on the duration and price you select at the time of purchase. Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Settings > iTunes Account & App Store > Apple ID > Subscriptions to manage your membership and turn auto-renew off. Your iTunes Account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed.

App Description
Minimal Diary is an app that allows you to easily and quickly record the present and review the past.

Inspired by "Daybreak Diary", "Nine Square Diary" and "Bullet Journal”, we have incorporated the idea that "every moment in life is worth recording" into Minimal Diary, which allows you to record every interesting things that happens at present, such as good songs, unforgettable movies, delicious food, and general living.

Even the simplest life log is a unique biography of you.

Features:
[Timeline]
Clearly show what happened in a day according to the chronological order of the day.

[Tags]
The process of travel, the latest TV series watched, the book excerpts done by reading, the daily time of falling asleep, each time the fitness record ...... All a series of moments can be tagged, and then by clicking on the tags you can filter out this series of memories and see your experiences and changes at a glance.

[Switch Dates]
The button at the bottom not only allows you to add diary entries, but dragging it also allows you to quickly switch dates for easy time travel.

We hope you like the diary and enjoy the app. For any questions and suggestions, please contact minimal.software.studio@gmail.com.

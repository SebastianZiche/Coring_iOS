App Description
People who practice CBT between therapy sessions have better outcomes than 70% of people who don’t. (Kazantzis et al. (2016))

Make the most of CBT by practicing with Bold.



Real reviews:

“I recommend it to my patients all the time” - Hal McAlllister, LCSW

“Everything is explained so well and I love that it is all evidence based!” - Kirstie T, CBT Therapist, NHS

“This app has been a life changer for me” - u/TrippyChick

“It’s the right mix of simple and functional and has been a significant part of my CBT journey.” - Matthew O.

“This app and the positive psychology/CBT exercises helped me breakdown the insurmountable gloom of my depression and anxiety by allowing me to finally find a few minutes a day where I can thrive.” - u/HilA1399

“From personal experience this app has propelled my self-esteem, happiness and motivation forward unlike anything else I’ve tried. It’s about the effort you’re willing to put forth that will get you to where you wish to be. Take the step for yourself!!!” - u/23466

"This app does exactly what it says on the tin: helps you change how you think" - u/Solrisen



How it works:

Do I need a subscription to use Bold?

Yes, users need to purchase a subscription to be able to use the app. There’s a 7 day free trial and then it’s $4.99 per month.

Is Bold a medical provider? Is Bold a replacement for therapy?

No, Bold is providing a mobile app for guided journaling in the health & mindfulness space. However, Bold is not a health care or medical provider, nor should our service be considered medical advice. Only your doctor or other health care provider can do that. While there is third party evidence and common knowledge that journaling can assist in the prevention and recovery process for many mental conditions as well as in improving some performance and relationship issues, Bold makes no claims, representations or guarantees that the service provide a therapeutic benefit.


People who practice CBT between therapy sessions have better outcomes than 70% of people who don’t.(Kazantzis et al. (2016)) Make the most of CBT by practicing often with Bold.

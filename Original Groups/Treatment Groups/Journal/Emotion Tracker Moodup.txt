App Description
Moods are a natural part of your emotional rhythm, and they can change based on various factors, such as time, situation, and circumstance. By tracking your moods, you can discover patterns and insights that can help you improve your well-being.

This app allows you to record your moods and associate them with different emotions and triggers. You can use them as a daily journal to track your thoughts and feelings, and see them in a visual way. This can help you understand yourself better and manage your moods more effectively.

Benefits of using this app are:
- You can become more aware of your feelings and emotions
- You can create your space to reflect on your feelings and emotions
- You can recognize patterns and triggers affecting your moods
- You can make better decisions related to triggers and moods
- You can share your mood checks with your therapist and get the support you need

With MoodUp Premium, you can also:
- Observe Stats: See how your moods, emotions, and triggers vary and identify trends and patterns.
- Attach Photo: Add a photo to your mood entry to capture the moment and express yourself visually.
- Backup Data: Sync your data across devices via iCloud automatically and never lose your mood history.

To access the MoodUp Premium content and functionality, you can choose the yearly auto-renewable subscription. This recurring transaction will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase, and will automatically renew unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription. Renewals will be charged the same cost within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscriptions or turn off auto-renewal by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.

App Description
Poz is a mindful journaling app. It helps you live mindfully with the simple magic of journaling. By combining the simplicity of a real-world notebook with the flexibility of a complex note-taking app, Poz has everything you need to build a consistent mindful journaling practice – 100% free.

With dynamic prompts, daily goals, password protection, and your own self-recorded entries, Poz is the perfect way to check in with yourself and reflect on what matters most.

When you take just five minutes each day to be mindful, you will learn more about who you are and restore your connection to each moment that matters. Every day you use it gives you the opportunity to create a record of personal growth and meaningful self-discovery.


DAILY GOAL & REMINDERS
Poz uses daily reminders and a daily goal to promote consistency, encouraging you to sit down a few times per day and build a habit of mindfulness. Unlike other reflective journaling apps, Poz has no time limits or “gamification” elements – just focus on your thoughts and feelings.

Simply set reminders for yourself to write in Poz each day, and respond to the wide range of prompts. We’ll help you focus your thoughts into something beautiful and useful.


PROMPTS
With Poz, we’re trying to change the way society looks at journaling. Instead of haphazardly jotting down a few thoughts whenever you can, our app will remind you to write just a bit in your journal each day and offer an experience that takes you through different kinds of prompts based on where you are in your day. With a wide range of prompts to choose from, you’re sure to find a topic that resonates.

At the end of the day, the most important part of a consistent and fulfilling journaling practice is your genuine reflection. Poz’s password protection and simple interface invites you to pour all your thoughts onto the page/


PASSWORD PROTECTED
Poz is YOUR personal journaling app. Use Face/Touch ID or a password to protect your prompts, and feel the freedom of a completely secure place to express your inner world. All your notes are stored on your device, so no one has any access to a single word you write, including us.


COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE
Change the name, color, pattern, basically everything about your journal and the journaling experience so you can feel completely comfortable when reflecting on your day or pouring out your soul.


Poz encourages small moments of introspection throughout the day. Whether you’re someone who likes to write their thoughts out in full sentences or only needs a few minutes of clarity, Poz has been designed for anyone who could use a space to document and reflect on their life.

HOW MENTALIO WORKS:
1. Record how you feel each day.

2. Monitor your mood using the daily tracker, powered by AI technology. This tracker gauges your emotions, feelings, panic episodes, and other mental health parameters, then presents you with related graphs and insights.

3. Respond to personalized questions derived from your journal entries.

4. Review and amend your past journal entries.

5. Obtain daily, weekly, and monthly summaries containing personalized insights and reminders.


MOOD REPORTING:
With Mentalio's mood tracker, you can consistently monitor your feelings. By grasping your sentiments towards different aspects of life, you can better manage them and promote a positive way of living.


JOURNALING:
Maintaining a diary consistently is beneficial in addressing lingering fears and concerns. These digital journals aid you in prioritizing your concerns, necessities, and tasks, thereby guiding you to tackle issues that affect your mental state.


BREATHING:
Choose from three distinct breathing exercises accompanied by soothing background sounds. This meditative approach is designed to offer profound relaxation and solace.


SELF-TESTS:
Mentalio administers varied tests to evaluate levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and potential panic episodes. Such self-assessment tools and trackers are pivotal in proactively managing mental health, empowering you to take preemptive measures.


EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS:
It's essential to understand and express our feelings and emotions authentically. Concealing or denying them can lead to increased stress and mental vulnerability. Mentalio provides resources and training to help users connect with and understand their true emotions, promoting a healthier mental outlook.


STATISTICS:
Besides providing insights from psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Mentalio offers a statistical view of your progress using anxiety tests, panic episode logs, and emotion trackers. This allows you to gauge the effectiveness of your mental health initiatives.

Version 2.0 (Jan 26, 2023)
    Introducing the latest update for Mentalio, the AI-powered mental health support app for teenagers! We're excited to announce that this update includes a variety of new features specifically designed to better serve our young audience.

    First and foremost, we're thrilled to announce that Mentalio is now completely free to use across all functions! We believe that mental health support should be accessible to all, and this update removes any barriers to accessing our tools and resources.

    We've also improved a new mood reporting and guided affirmation feature, allowing teenagers to track their mood and receive personalized insights and reminders. Additionally, we've improved our diary/journal feature, making it even easier for teens to prioritize their concerns, needs, and activities and make better decisions to sort out the causes that are troubling their mind.

    We've also added a new breathing exercises feature, with three different breathing techniques with calming background sounds, to help manage anxiety and stress. We've also added new anxiety, stress and depression tests, as well as educational materials for teenagers to learn more about mental health.

    And last but not least, we've added new statistics feature, that shares facts from psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and also provides statistics about your progress through your anxiety tests, panic attack records, and emotion trackers so you can see how your efforts are leading you to stable mental health.

    We're confident that these updates will help even more teenagers to track and improve their mental health. Thank you for choosing Mentalio and please keep sending us feedback!

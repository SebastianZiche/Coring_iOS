Zebra - Diary, Journal
Simple but beautiful writing.
Lifestyle (Applications)
Free
App Promotional Text
The next generation of diary apps from Japan!
A simple, well-designed and easy to write diary application with a beautiful traditional Japanese colour scheme.
App Description
Zebra is a simple diary application that is designed to be beautiful, easy to use and easy to keep writing.
We've created the ideal diary with no ads and all the features are free for them!
Whether you are starting a diary for the first time or thinking of switching from paper to app, please download and try it!


【Features of Zebra】

◆More beautiful photos!
You can insert a photo in your diary (one photo only) to keep your memories of the day clearer and more beautiful because it is digital!

◆Edit later
When you look back and see what you have done, you may want to correct some things. We've got just the thing for you!

◆Weather and mood
Keep a diary of the day's weather and mood. It's as easy as tapping a pictogram!

◆Find out what was happening in the world "then".
At the end of each month we update the main news stories of the month, so you can look back and see what was happening in society!

◆Ad-free
Advertisements are a distraction and make it difficult to use. That's why Zebra has no ads at all.

◆Passcode lock for privacy.
Perfect if you don't want people to see your private diary! You can set the passcode input when you start the application, so you can manage your diary with peace of mind.

◆Reminder notifications
If you can make it a habit to write with the reminder, the continuation rate will be greatly improved.

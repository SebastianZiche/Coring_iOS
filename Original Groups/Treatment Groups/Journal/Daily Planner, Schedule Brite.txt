Version 2.0.56 (Aug 29, 2022)
    Hello! Brite Team online. 
    In this update, we launch 3 (!) new features:

    1. Countdown timers.

    Super easy to use countdown timer and reminder for the important events & dates in your life. In addition to receiving a notification when it is time for your event, you can receive reminders one day or a week before the event. You can also add a photo as a cover and visually customize each countdown.

    2. Pomodoro Timer.

    The Pomodoro technique is highly effective as it helps you manage your time and work on a task without distractions. It is also beneficial as it helps you become more disciplined and think about your work. This technique is designed to combat multitasking and improve concentration. Add a Pomodoro widget to the My Day screen, and set up a countdown.

    3. Relaxing/concentration sounds.

    This exceptional feature will help you gain some concentration or gain relax, depending on what you need at the moment. Just choose a sound from the library, and tap on the sound icon to turn it on. You can also combine different sounds to create a unique melody as a soundtrack for your current moment.
    Water sounds, such as that gurgling brook or a steady waterfall, tended to be the most effective at improving positive affect (the psychological term for a more positive outlook or disposition and the experience of joy and interest). In contrast, bird sounds were best for lowering stress.

    All these widgets can be found in the widget gallery. Just add them to the "my day" screen of Brite to improve functionality and tailor them to your needs.

    Also, in this version, we've fixed some bugs and made performance improvements and UI overhaul

    In the next update, we plan to launch:
    1. Mac Desktop app
    2. Face ID/ Touch ID support to lock the app and keep your information super private.
Version 2.0.55 (Jul 23, 2022)
    Brite Update: A new help center

    We have finished working on a new, redesigned Help Center in Brite.

    We believe that one of the most valuable things in building long-term relations with users is to quickly and carefully answer any product questions that may appear. But, top-notch customer support- is something overvalued. So, we combined the three most common aspects of support we provide daily in one easy-to-use feature.

    Now you can quickly get an answer to any question about using ios or a web app.

    How it works:
    At the app's top, a new help center icon will appear. Tap on it and open the help center window.

    The help center includes three main sections:

    1. Chat with devs - here, you can ask questions about features and give your feedback to our team. In addition, we are always happy to chat with users, so feel free to write us a message if you have a question about Brite.

    2. Tutorials - here, you can watch short video guides that cover different aspects of Brite.

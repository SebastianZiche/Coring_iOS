Flow Journal: Writing a Diary
Live. Reflect. Journal.
Lifestyle (Applications)
Free
iPhone Only
App Description
Keep a journal and reflect. Writing is fundamentally system of organizing thoughts, and keeping a journal helps organize the mind. Taking time to write your thoughts will help you make sense of the world, your feelings and your motivations. How does it really work? Quite simply by freeing our mind from the job of processing that experience. As a result, it has been shown to improve our mood and leave us to sleep better.

There's no single magic moment. Building a habit to reflect every day through a journal entry, even if it is brief, yields many benefits over time. Similar to meditation, scientific studies have showed that it can boost mindfulness, communication skills, and working memory. It also helps heal wounds faster, by labeling them and acknowledging them, and ultimately making sense of difficult experiences. Think of it as "brain drain", a way to expel your energy buildup that muddies our subconscious.

Features:
- Daily reminders to reflect.
- Organize your day with themes.
- Track themes and notice patterns over time.
- Discover which themes are correlated, and which are not.
- Ads free.
- Complete privacy. Your data is in the safest possible place - in your hands.

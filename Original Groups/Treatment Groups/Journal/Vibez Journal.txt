App Description
Vibez is your daily mood journal. It is there to capture how and what you feel throughout the day. Did an activity? record it. Felt strange? Capture it. Let Vibez be there to help you understand how different aspects of your life impact your mood quality. Smart reporting helps getting insights that much easier. With some though, it should start to help shape your daily routine to get more days when you feel better.

Vibez can automatically capture additional information like your current location and weather. This way you can start to see if being at a specific place or seeing a certain weather pattern can help elevate or tank your mood.

We continue to look for ways to include more automated environmental information. Look for more exciting additions in future releases.

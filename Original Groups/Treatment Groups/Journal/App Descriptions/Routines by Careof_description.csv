So we re releasing this unofficial early version for free with the hope that it s helpful for all of you too. Routines by Care of helps you create morning and evening routines log how they make you feel and evaluate how those habits are helping you reach your health goals over time. What you can do Create personalized health and wellness routines Set reminders for daily habits Practice self reflection Learn from weekly insights about what habits are effective Track your progress over time How it works Whether you re looking to improve your sleep energy or stress it can be hard to know what habits are working for you unless you have data to look back on. And since we re all different there s no one size fits all approach for anything. Routines by Care of helps you create routines you can stick to then gives you the tools and personalized data you need to measure the impact those habits have on how you feel over time so you can find what works for you. Why we re releasing the app early We weren t planning on releasing the app now but as the weeks unfolded we realized the app has been a huge resource for our team internally. We ve found that sticking to even the smallest routines can help make things feel normal even with so much up in the air. We wanted to share it with you in case it helps you too.

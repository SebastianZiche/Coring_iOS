We focus on teaching about CBT because outside research shows again and again that it the most effective form of therapy to improve mental well being for the vast majority of folks who experience symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Studies show that patients can get the benefits of learning CBT techniques without an in person therapist. Bloom gives users the power to learn about mental health in a guided self directed way at their own pace. WHAT USERS SAY Bloom is considered a cheaper and more accessible option: Not everybody has access or can afford a therapist. This is like a therapist in my pocket. Personalized but still private. I love that I can do it at my own time and I don t have to feel awkward talking to a stranger about my life. It s an easy and private discrete thing no one even has to know! WHEN SHOULD I USE CBT CBT can help people with depression by giving you tools to challenge the negative thoughts and override them with more realistic and positive thought processes. CBT is also used to help many more psychological problems. In some cases other forms of therapy used at the same time may be recommended for best results. Self Therapy is best for people with mild to moderate mental health problems. If you experience severe anxiety or depression Bloom can be a great add on to therapy however we do recommend speaking with a professional in severe situations. CONNECT WITH US!

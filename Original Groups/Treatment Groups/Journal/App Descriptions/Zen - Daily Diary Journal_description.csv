1665333520,0,Zen Daily Diary Journal,Lifestyle,2023-01-19,2023-01-19,92.39,2,0,0,1,Zen is the minimal diary app. Zen was developed based on the developer s own struggles of not being able to continue any diary. Effortlessly Record If you try to write perfectly you will not know where to start. Zen allows you to keep a diary in a simple and easy manner by recording what happened in fragments line by line just like a note. Even on days when you are tired you can keep a diary as if it were a note making it easy to continue to keep a diary every day. Of course you can also record detailed information. Calendar Sync Zen automatically displays your schedule for the day by connecting to your calendar. This makes it easy to look back on the day and smoothly start writing in the diary. Even if you forget to keep a diary for a few days you can easily keep a diary by checking the day s schedule. Make Journaling a Habit Receiving notifications at a set time every day will support in making journaling a habit. Minimal We paid special attention to the design because it is an app that you use every day. The minimal design allows you to keep track of your daily activities intuitively without getting lost in the operations. Wabi sabi Wabi sabi is a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. We are not perfect. So we don t need to write perfect sentences. Just write what you think. The essence is short. That s why Zen has a limit of 280 characters. Security You can set a password when you start the app to further enhance your privacy. You can also unlock the app with fingerprint or face ID. Organize with Tags You can add keywords or categories related to your diary as tags. This allows you to efficiently manage and search diary entries using tags. Don t worry just write. Our Story There are many diary apps in the world but I couldn t master any of them because they are all too complex. So I decided to create my own minimal diary app that only includes the bare minimum necessary features. The only thing this app can do is to record and look back on daily events. I am constantly updating the app so that people who are looking for a simple diary app like me can be satisfied with it. I would be happy if this app can be of any help in your life. I wish for your life to be enriched. Terms of Use: https: tinylab apps.web.app TermsOfService ja.html Privacy Policy: https: tinylab apps.web.app PrivacyPolicy ja.html

BENEFITS OF JOURNALING Journaling works because it helps you organize your thoughts realize what s important and clear your mind of junk. This makes decision making and progress easier. However maintaining a journaling habit can be challenging at times. You may not feel like writing or exploring a certain topic or you may simply forget to check in.

Sometimes our thoughts make it harder to reach our true potential. Fear and worrying can keep us safe from real danger but it can also stop us from doing amazing things. Imagine a world where Michelangelo let a fear of heights stop him from painting or imagine if 12 year old Justin Bieber let a fear of public singing stop him from making music. This world would be a lot less lively and fun. We believe everyone can make the world a better place in their own unique way and the first step is to make sure nothing holds you back. That s why you should journal. PRIVACY Turtle s private journaling experience acts as a sanctuary for the mind. As a result we do not store your journals on a remote server.

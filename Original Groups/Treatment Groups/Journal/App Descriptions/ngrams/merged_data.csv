All journaling entries are encrypted and saved in the cloud. Nothing is seen by humans. None of your training data is shared with third parties or outside partners. IS BLOOM EFFECTIVE The team at Bloom understand how helpful cognitive behavioral therapy CBT can be for folks who need to improve their mental well being. We focus on teaching about CBT because outside research shows again and again that it the most effective form of therapy to improve mental well being for the vast majority of folks who experience symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Studies show that patients can get the benefits of learning CBT techniques without an in person therapist. Bloom gives users the power to learn about mental health in a guided self directed way at their own pace. WHAT USERS SAY Bloom is considered a cheaper and more accessible option: Not everybody has access or can afford a therapist. This is like a therapist in my pocket. Personalized but still private. I love that I can do it at my own time and I don t have to feel awkward talking to a stranger about my life. It s an easy and private discrete thing no one even has to know! WHEN SHOULD I USE CBT CBT can help people with depression by giving you tools to challenge the negative thoughts and override them with more realistic and positive thought processes. CBT is also used to help many more psychological problems. In some cases other forms of therapy used at the same time may be recommended for best results. Self Therapy is best for people with mild to moderate mental health problems. If you experience severe anxiety or depression Bloom can be a great add on to therapy however we do recommend speaking with a professional in severe situations. CONNECT WITH US!

It starts with one intriguing fill in the blank question for the whole world each day. Just fill in the blanks with you . Then see how the rest of the world responds! It s a chance to be inspired and uplifted. And we have a thoughtful daily quote for you too. There s no judgment here. It s all anonymous. Just a chance to come together for a shared human moment. An app that offers a place to reflect and connect without the possibility of judgment or anger. Mindful Technology ... inspires you to think more deeply each day about a simple but profound topic and helps you feel more connected to your fellow humans around the world. Center for Compassionate Leadership WHAT S A HALOHA A Haloha is a simple thought provoking question that gives us an opportunity for self reflection imagination and creativity. Here are a few examples: If I had the courage I would ____________________________ If my body could talk it would tell me ___________________ You would never guess by looking at me that ___________ I want to be remembered for ____________________________ My theme song should be _______________________________ HOW IT WORKS 1 Daily Haloha starts with you. Take a moment for yourself each day to consider the question. This is your chance for self reflection. Remember you only answer the day s Haloha question once so make it count! A Haloha is a chance to truly be yourself and express your thoughts honestly because Halohas are anonymous and free of judgment. Once you fill in the blanks you select a Mood color that best fits your Haloha. And then you re ready to offer your personal Haloha to the rest of the world! 2 Pay it forward. When you send your Haloha it s randomly and anonymously delivered to another person somewhere in the world and instantly you ll get a Haloha back from another thoughtful and curious person. You can even see where in the world that Haloha came from. Then you can select a Response sticker to let the sender know they were heard! 3 Be part of the bigger picture.

Daily Journal is your guide to daily self care. You can use to track your moods and jot down your feelings. And This is a App that allows you to process complex thoughts and emotions which helps promote positive thinking and self talk. WHY DO YOU NEED A DAILY JOURNAL Having a consistent recording of your life can be invaluable because it allows you to track personal patterns or behaviors over time. This history can show your personal growth and give you memories of important moments in your life SURPRISING BENEFITS OF DAILY JOURNAL 1. Can Reduce stress and anxiety. Journaling about your anxieties soothes your nerves and helps you brainstorm for solutions to your problems. You can also use the mood tracker found in Daily Journal to indicate your sentiment level. Overall expressing yourself in a diary is a good way to free up any tension that prevents you from feeling happy. 2. Helps you learn from your experiences. Daily Journal is a good way to help us to stop take a step back and reflect on ourselves. We can look back at our life in a journal and think about how we ve changed and what we can do to improve ourselves. When you journal and reflect on the day you re more likely to draw lessons from what you ve gone through. 3. Improves your communication skills. When you journal you learn to better express yourself. And this lets you better communicate your feelings with others. The more self aware you become the more you can make yourself understood to others. 4. Improves your mindfulness. Writing about your surroundings and the present moment helps you become more mindful every day even when you re not journaling. It teaches you to pay attention and be present. Daily Journal brings you into that state of mindfulness. 5. Boosts your self esteem. Positive journaling has been found to help improve feelings of well being and self esteem. A lack of confidence usually means an inner critic or a voice of self doubt. And although that voice never goes away journaling puts it into perspective. It gives space for your positive thoughts so the negatives don t take over. 6. Helps you sleep better. Bedtime worry about incomplete future tasks contributes significantly to people s difficulty in falling asleep. If you have trouble falling asleep at night you can try writing in a journal focusing specifically on positive events. This may help you sleep longer and better according to research.

Your healing journey starts in your bed when you drift off to sleep and enter a dreaming REM stage. Your brain is sorting out your emotional concerns. DreamApp has little to do with this process stage and all the credit goes to its evolution and nature. STAGE TWO Dream Reporting and Journaling Wake up and make sure to log your dream report. Notice how the story you dreamed about makes you feel upon awakening. Does it define your mood for the coming day Capture your thoughts and feelings before they fizzle out as they most definitely will. Journaling your dreams sets the ground for asking questions like why you were dreaming what you were dreaming and how you can use this information to make decisions in your waking life.

Unlike reading your lab exam results the chart will only show you the statistical norm across the studied populations and any actionable recommendations can only be prescribed to you according to your specific state and history of health and illness. STAGE FOUR Discussing Your Dreams with a Therapist Yes you heard it right. DreamApp connects you to a board certified psychologist specializing in using dream analysis. It doesn t mean that DreamApp thinks you are mental and connects you to a doctor . It means that DreamApp believes in the immense power of honest and open conversation in a safe and compassionate setting.

Q: Why is self talk important A: Self talk is important in many ways. It s the script that we use to frame our lives. If we constantly give ourselves negative messages then we begin to develop automatic thoughts that take us from a particular incident to a negative emotional reaction. Conversely if we engage in positive self talk we begin to view the world in a more positive manner and will ultimately feel better about ourselves. We can t always control what happens but we can control how we react to it! Tim Legg MD

BENEFITS OF JOURNALING Journaling works because it helps you organize your thoughts realize what s important and clear your mind of junk. This makes decision making and progress easier. However maintaining a journaling habit can be challenging at times. You may not feel like writing or exploring a certain topic or you may simply forget to check in. That s where Turtle comes in as your superpower. It goes beyond traditional writing to offer drawing voice recordings and the ability to add photos and videos. You can also play peaceful sounds to create a calming atmosphere and set personalized reminders to ensure journaling becomes a lifelong habit. Sometimes our thoughts make it harder to reach our true potential. Fear and worrying can keep us safe from real danger but it can also stop us from doing amazing things. Imagine a world where Michelangelo let a fear of heights stop him from painting or imagine if 12 year old Justin Bieber let a fear of public singing stop him from making music. This world would be a lot less lively and fun. We believe everyone can make the world a better place in their own unique way and the first step is to make sure nothing holds you back. That s why you should journal. PRIVACY Turtle s private journaling experience acts as a sanctuary for the mind. As a result we do not store your journals on a remote server.

1507575828,0,Punkt Journal Private Safe,Health and Fitness,2020-05-17,2020-05-17,11.84,18.0,0,0,1,Punkt makes journaling secure private easy and fun. But the best of starting a journal now is that you become a happier person. Here s what makes Punkt special: EASY TO USE Punkt s focus is on a simple design. Your stories are the most important part of the app so why should we distract you with any other complicated stuff SECURE AND PRIVATE Punkt saves your stories on your local device and in your private iCloud. No one but you can read your stories. You can also protect your stories with Face ID or Touch ID. NO LOGIN NO ADS Punkt works without sharing any personally identifiable information. The app is focused on simplicity and privacy. There is no login no Facebook or Google SDKs no analytics tracking no server connection. Everything you do in Punkt is truly private and secure. ACCESSIBILITY Punkt supports dynamic type voice over and voice control. It is designed to be used by everyone. I would welcome any feedback regarding accessibility as this is truly important to me. FAIR PRICING Punkt is developed just by one developer therefore I want to make really fair and transparent pricing. If Punkt makes you just a little bit happier you can help to contribute that the app stays independent and does not need to display ads or require personal data. Why did I start building this app I m a startup founder myself and I ve been through very rough but also hyper exciting and happy times. That s tough by itself but if one of your loved ones is helpless in pain and suffers then your world stops spinning. Bad times in business and private life made me think about how I can get out of this and become more positive and happier in the end. I ve researched a lot and came across the one sentence journaling technique. Long story short I ve started tracking my days in a Google Sheet. With just a few clicks I could make myself smile again by reading stories about happy days. But also the other way round looking at rough times makes you appreciate even more what you have in your life. Now I want to help other people with this app. If you have any feedback you can reach out at https: punktapp.me or gregor punktapp.me Should you choose to support the development of this app and unlock all premium features of Punkt payments will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.

1665333520,0,Zen Daily Diary Journal,Lifestyle,2023-01-19,2023-01-19,92.39,2.0,0,0,1,Zen is the minimal diary app. Zen was developed based on the developer s own struggles of not being able to continue any diary. Effortlessly Record If you try to write perfectly you will not know where to start. Zen allows you to keep a diary in a simple and easy manner by recording what happened in fragments line by line just like a note. Even on days when you are tired you can keep a diary as if it were a note making it easy to continue to keep a diary every day. Of course you can also record detailed information. Calendar Sync Zen automatically displays your schedule for the day by connecting to your calendar. This makes it easy to look back on the day and smoothly start writing in the diary. Even if you forget to keep a diary for a few days you can easily keep a diary by checking the day s schedule. Make Journaling a Habit Receiving notifications at a set time every day will support in making journaling a habit. Minimal We paid special attention to the design because it is an app that you use every day. The minimal design allows you to keep track of your daily activities intuitively without getting lost in the operations. Wabi sabi Wabi sabi is a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. We are not perfect. So we don t need to write perfect sentences. Just write what you think. The essence is short. That s why Zen has a limit of 280 characters. Security You can set a password when you start the app to further enhance your privacy. You can also unlock the app with fingerprint or face ID. Organize with Tags You can add keywords or categories related to your diary as tags. This allows you to efficiently manage and search diary entries using tags. Don t worry just write. Our Story There are many diary apps in the world but I couldn t master any of them because they are all too complex. So I decided to create my own minimal diary app that only includes the bare minimum necessary features. The only thing this app can do is to record and look back on daily events. I am constantly updating the app so that people who are looking for a simple diary app like me can be satisfied with it. I would be happy if this app can be of any help in your life. I wish for your life to be enriched. Terms of Use: https: tinylab apps.web.app TermsOfService ja.html Privacy Policy: https: tinylab apps.web.app PrivacyPolicy ja.html

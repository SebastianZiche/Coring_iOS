What's New

Version 3.0.10 (Dec 11, 2023)
    - Fixed: Hyperlinks and Strikethroughs did not save until other unrelated modifications have been done to trigger autosave.
    - Fixed: Importing photos taken directly from the Camera within the app did not do anything.
    - Fixed: Some users may have had troubles installing the app on the Apple Watch.
    - Fixed: Images may be stuck "loading" - they are caused by previously deleted images of which the app still thinks exists and is trying to load.
    - Fixed: Dragging and dropping images to export images out of the app, or copy images to multiple entries, may cause the app to incorrectly use low resolution thumbnails of the image.
    - Fixed: Images may flicker upon selection of an entry, upon autosave, or upon scrolling through lists or pages with images.
    - Fixed: Smart Search did not correctly account for search terms consisting of the day of the week (so searching for "Saturday" did not work).
    - Improved: Added more hints of Safe Mode and direct shortcuts to exit it.
    - Improved: Disabling image previews will now show a placeholder image instead of a blank space.
Version 3.0.9 (Jun 15, 2023)
    - Fixed: Storage Location preference settings may not update correctly after a background iCloud login update. This may have caused unexpected confusion as to why storage locations randomly switched.
    - Fixed: Journal Picker headers may not appear correctly on macOS.
    - Improved: Information about storage location differences of a journal are now clearer. The app also now prompts to automatically change settings for you if you want to access journals in a different location without migrating.
    - Improved: There are now double-confirmations for journal storage location migrations to prevent accidental migrations.
Version 3.0.8 (Jun 9, 2023)
    - Fixed: On recent versions of iOS, iPadOS and macOS and Personal Diary, there is a chance where you would frequently get scary iCloud access denied errors. This is because the system temporarily removed access to iCloud for whatever reason. It has now changed to a "waiting for iCloud access" indicator, which automatically dismisses once iCloud is ready.
    - Fixed: Some miscellaneous crashes that do not appear to have any reason should be resolved.
    - Fixed: Depending on luck, you may occasionally find a warning of an "unavailable" entry, which does not acutally exist.
    - Improved: Entries which have data load issues are now ordered beyond the latest entries in the list.
    - Improved: When you are in the Timeline and you have written data in iCloud in the past, but no data is downloaded (making the Timeline appear blank), and system configuration permits, the app will more aggressively poll for iCloud updates and refresh the Timeline in order to retrieve your data.
Version 3.0.7 (May 1, 2023)
    - Fixed: On recent versions of iOS 16, iPadOS 16 and macOS 13 (Ventura), the app may incorrectly assume all your diary data is downloaded from iCloud, and attempt to load them before the download is complete, causing extremely slow loading times in the Timeline.
    - Fixed: Some links in the app (like FAQ) were moved, and are thus updated.
    - Improved: The Data Availability section in Storage Location & Usage now shows an estimated percentage of data downloaded locally.
    - Misc: Removed legacy code and updated dependencies.
Version 3.0.6 (Feb 26, 2023)
    - Fixed: Page Curl Animations added tap-to-flip-page tap targets that conflict with button taps on images and text, making it impossible to edit text or add a new image in some situations. This is now removed.
    - Fixed: Strikethrough option was missing in recent versions of the app.
    - Fixed: Strikethrough and Hyperlink keyboard shortcuts were missing in recent versions of the app.
    - Fixed: PDF and Printing Export Cover Page might not be removed even if you turn it off.
    - Improved: For PDF and Printing exports, they might crash when merging large numbers of pages due to running out of memory. This is mitigated through transferring partial exported contents onto storage and improved memory management.
    - Improved: For PDF and Printing exports, you can now specify the starting page number, so you may merge PDF parts from the past outside of the app and do not need to reexport everything to get the page numbers right.

    Known Issues:
    - PDF Export may not work correctly if you have too many images. You will now be served a warning if you hit memory limits.

Version 3.0.5 (Dec 31, 2022)
    - Fixed: Mood and Weather cannot be removed if already set.
    - Fixed: Biometrics Unlock may be displayed even when it is not supported or enabled on your device.
    - Fixed: In some cases you might be able to "import" inline images into the text editor. Though it looks like it worked, the action isn't supported and it is not saved. The text editor will now correctly reflect this and not show inline images.
    - Improved: Closing the Journal Picker (available when Multi-Journal Mode is on) will now lock the app as well (if a passcode is set).
    - Improved: Entry data now internally tracks a version number, so future version incompatibilities can be marked with an appropriate warning.
    - Attempted to Fix: Personal Diary might crash on older versions of macOS.
Version 3.0.4 (Dec 22, 2022)
    - Fixed: Notifications stop working after 2 weeks in the newer versions, claiming that you have never opened the app even if you did.
    - Fixed: 'Something went wrong' alerts may appear on app launch even when nothing is wrong.

    Known Issues (go to in-app section to read details):
    - Page Curl Animations may conflict with the image attachment buttons and Focused Editing Mode.
    - PDF Export may not work correctly if you have too many images.
Version 3.0.3 (Dec 11, 2022)
    - Fixed: Searching with multiple words may not work in certain languages.
    - Fixed: Search terms with only the month and year now correctly shows results (again).
    - Fixed: Delete button was missing in the image attachment panel.
    - Fixed: Image thumbnails may appear in the wrong orientation in previews on iOS 14 and below.
    - Fixed: A transition animation may unexpectedly occur which "transitions" to the same entry.
    - Improved: Added a section to perform basic customizations for VoiceOver prompts.
    - Improved: Date Format options for the Timeline view has been rephrased for clarity.
Version 3.0.2 (Dec 8, 2022)
    - Fixed: Search terms with only the month and year now correctly shows results.
    - Fixed: Searching contents were incorrectly case sensitive. That is fixed and are now no longer case sensitive.
    - Fixed: Tags now show up correctly in PDF exports.
    - Fixed: Editing an entry while entries are refreshing may cause edits to be undone and reverted.
    - Fixed: A rare crash that may occur when the number of entries loaded changes while the UI is being updated.
    - Fixed: When mood and weather are turned off for new entries, auto mood detection should not have kicked in automatically.
    - Fixed: Raw Data Archive now outputs folder names with the corresponding timezone the entry is written in.
    - Improved: The timezone indicators for entries with timezones different than your current one can now either be hidden or ignored.
    - Improved: Clarified in-app explanation for legacy iOS version warnings.
Version 3.0.1 (Nov 26, 2022)
    - Fixed: Toggling the Multi-Journal Mode switch may crash the app.
    - Fixed: The app may crash when creating a new entry.
    - Fixed: Some other miscellaneous crashes that may occur.
    - Improved: Images in PDFs should be less likely to fail to export.
Version 3.0 (Nov 16, 2022)
    Personal Diary has been massively revamped behind the scenes and is now on version 3! Enjoy vastly improved app launch times, lots of new features and compatibility with all new operating systems and devices released so far.

    Background Entry Data Loading
    - You can now use the app, browse, edit and create diary entries, even while the app is still in the middle of loading your existing data in the background. No more long loading times at the launch screen!
    - Note: Some actions, like searching through all your data, are unavailable until all entries are loaded.

    Multi-Journal mode
    - You can now create multiple journals to organise your info, such as separate ones for Personal and Work entries.
    - You can choose a preferred journal for your own reference, for which the app may auto-open if no other journals are open.

    Large Screen and App Window Optimizations
    - On larger landscape displays and window sizes, the timeline and entry can now be shown in split view, making better use of available screen space.
    - A maximum width may now be set for the entry page, so it doesn't span the entire width of a display.
    - Full compatibility with Stage Manager on iPadOS and macOS.

    UI Revamps
    - An updated Timeline design now allows for dynamically sized table rows and entry image previews.
    - Timeline and Entry contents can now be displayed in split view.
    - Settings page organisation and VoiceOver accessibility has been improved.
    - Image attachment panel design has been updated with a simpler floating design, new context menus and improved VoiceOver accessibility.
    - Apple Watch app UI conventions have been updated with some design cues used in watchOS 7+.

    Miscellaneous
    - New sorting order options now has the ability to sort in chronological or reverse chronological order, jump to current entry, and more!
    - Apple Watch app now uses the watchOS system keyboard on Series 7+ instead of FlickType. Older devices still default to FlickType. (If you still want to use FlickType on Series 7+, tap-and-hold the entry edit fields)
    - Entry tags are now supported, which allows for faster and more precise search results.
    - Timezone information are now tracked in entries and displayed if there's a mismatch with your current timezone.
    - You can now import multiple images by once on iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and macOS 11 and later through the photo and file pickers.

    - Themes have been revamped to allow for more customization. No longer are you forced to pick vibrant colors in the app, you can also choose pastel and minimal ones!
    - An updated machine learning model for Auto Mood Detection is now included and used on iOS 14, iPadOS 14, macOS 11 and above, which should yield improved precision and accuracy.
    - The search engine has an updated algorithm that now works better with most languages, even if the app isn't translated to them.
    - New option for page curl animations to emulate a physical book.
    - New shortcuts are now available directly in the Timeline.
    - Improved syncing with other devices reduces the chance of conflicts and data overwrites from multiple devices at once.
    - Data migration to and from iCloud Drive will no longer automatically happen and must be manually initiated. This prevents unintended automatic data migrations.
    - Resolved lag issues when displaying large amounts of data in the Timeline.

    Thank you everyone for using and supporting Personal Diary to this day!

Version 2.5.11 (May 24, 2020)
    Hi Personal Diary users! Hope all is well. Here's a long overdue update to the app, focusing on quite a bit of bug fixes and stability improvements. Details below.

    - Fixed some bugs and glitches that may occur when operating with keyboard shortcuts.
    - Resolved crashes and UI glitches that occur when you perform actions too quickly while a search result is active.

    - Resolved an issue where text formatting, specifically text formatted only in italics, may not preserve its style.
    - Bulk data export options are revamped. Notably, they now show their progress, so you'll know whether something is happening or not when exporting to ZIP, PDF or printing data.

    - More preparations for multi-journal support.

    If you ever encounter problems with Personal Diary, feel free to send me an email; I'd be happy to help!
Version 2.5.10 (Jan 18, 2020)
    - Minor bug fixes.
    - Added Acknowledgements.
Version 2.5.9 (Jan 2, 2020)
    - Fixed a critical bug where resetting a forgotten passcode, running diagnostics, and other parts of Recovery Mode that just doesn't seem to do anything as a subsequent alert does not pop up.
    - Added ability to check purchased tips.
Version 2.5.8 (Dec 30, 2019)
    - Made significant changes behind the scenes to prepare the app for multiple journals and custom attachments (video, audio, files etc) support. Stay tuned!
    - Updated App Store screenshots.

    Do feel free to report any issues you may have encountered to me using the "Report a Problem" option within the app. I'd be happy to help!
Version 2.5.7 (Dec 14, 2019)
    - Fixes a bug where the Plain White theme renders text and buttons in white, making them look invisible on a white background.
    - Resolves an inconvenience where overriding light or dark themes won't necessarily update throughout the app until the app is completely restarted.
    - Improved the phrasing of the entry deletion alert to warn about the fact that deletion will sync across devices.
    - Removed some animations as they have a small chance to glitch out and cause entries in the Timeline to "fly away".
    - Some internal code changes to improve future compatibility.
Version 2.5.6 (Dec 2, 2019)
    - Fixed an issue where 'Title' labels interfere with the search bar on older iOS versions.
    - Fixed a bug where iPad users using iOS 13.2 or later would have issues exporting data as the app would freeze a little and not show the share sheet.

    - Minor phrasing changes to the error prompt that appears after a crash.

    - A prompt now confirms that diary data is ready for export, before showing the Share Sheet to select where to save your file.
    - Hopefully the bug where some users aren't able to select a location to save their exported file is resolved.
    - Fixes watchOS app UI glitch where the Show More or Load More button is visible and sometimes interactive while data is supposed to be loading.
    - Slightly refreshed the Dark Theme in the Timeline view.
    - Fixes a bug where the Images heading does not update its counter after adding a new image.
Version 2.5.3 (Nov 14, 2019)
    It appears that almost nobody checks the App Store for app updates before sending emails or writing negative reviews about how the app "doesn't work properly". (For example: version 2.5.2 already fixes a serious problem in version 2.5.1 *in less than a day* but a large number of people never realised a newer update existed.)

    Thus, I've decided to include a handy "Check for updates & bug fixes" button within Recovery Mode in version 2.5.3, to allow you to easily check for fixes and update the app.

    Another thing changed in this release is an improved error prompt that appears after a crash, as some people do not seem to fully understand what it meant in the past.

    Oh and yes, as mentioned above, the bug in version 2.5.1 (where creating or viewing entries will crash the app) is already fixed some time ago. Please update to the latest version A.S.A.P. if you're still experiencing the issue. Thank you.

    Do contact me from within the app if you have any questions. Thanks for using Personal Diary!
Version 2.5.2 (Nov 8, 2019)
    Version 2.5.2:
    - This update fixes a critical issue in P.Diary 2.5.1 where users using iOS versions older than iOS 13.2 are not able to use the app normally, as the app crashes when you try to add an entry, among other areas. iOS 13.2+ users were not affected by the issue.
    - This update also fixes a bug where biometrics authentication is possible even if it's disabled.


    Version 2.5.1:
    - Re-added the latest FlickType SDK in the watch app. Type away with the new version of the award-winning keyboard, right from your wrist!

    - Improved data sync mechanism in the watch app, so now you can view your entries and create new ones while the synchronisation is taking place.
    - The passcode will now be confirmed twice when setting a passcode for the first time.
    - Fixes a bug where iPad users cannot import data.
    - Fixes autorotate not working while keyboard is visible. Previously, you could only type in landscape mode on your phone if you rotated to landscape before typing.

Version 2.5 (Oct 6, 2019)

    - Added compatibility with the latest iPhone & iPad.
    - Added import functionality, so you can restore any backups you made in the past as a *.zip file exported by the app.
    - Fixed a date corruption issue if you restore an iOS 13 backup or transferred data to an iOS 13 enabled device, like the new iPhone 11. However, this version of the app needs to run before iOS 13 is installed, otherwise it would be a little too late. Any corrupted data unfortunately cannot be recovered unless you have a backup.
    - Fixed some bugs regarding data migration and data export.
    - Removed FlickType SDK temporarily as it is not yet compatible with watchOS 6. 
Version 2.4.30 (Aug 22, 2019)

    - Fixed an issue where if text formatting (bold, italics etc) are applied at the start of any entry, the exported content would have messed up styles.

    - Improved Dark Mode auto switching such that it performs less unnecessary work in the background.
    - Cleaned up some of the app's source code.
    - Performed some preparations for iOS 13.

    * Warning to iOS 13 beta testers: The app is unable to keep data offloaded in the cloud and may initiate a full download upon first launch due to changes in iOS 13. This might cause some inconvenience and may utilize a large portion of your storage space in your device.
    ** Development of new features are paused to put full priority on fixing the above issue. Thank you for your understanding.

    If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email from within the app; I'd be happy to help! :)
Version 2.4.27 (Mar 10, 2019)

    - You can now modify a portion of an entry or continue writing an entry that you've made in the past, without replacing the text completely from scratch. (Only supported with the FlickType keyboard)
    - Hopefully I fixed the issue where on some devices you may keep encountering the message "Apologies for the crash" even when the app never crashed.
    - Slightly increased maximum font size supported.
    - Some other small glitches which hopefully you never noticed are fixed.

    *FlickType keyboard is a full QWERTY keyboard right on your Apple Watch, which is designed to be faster than scribbling, or dictating then correcting errors manually. You do not need to press the letters exactly where they are, FlickType will do the magic of figuring what you typed for you! Note that for now, it only supports English.

    If you have any issues, feel free to contact me (lwjdev@gmail.com). Hope you enjoy using the app!

    Critical Bug Fixes are released in this version. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

    Hey there! I've included a few amazing functionalities in this update. Notably:

Personal Diary is one of the FIRST diary/journal apps to offer a complete version of the iPhone app on your watch, including your entire Timeline and every single aspect of an entry can be created, viewed and/or modified directly on your watch as well (note: image viewing is not yet supported but will come soon!). Comes with automatic mood & weather selection as well (which can be overridden directly on your watch), and your settings will be mirrored from the Personal Diary app on your iPhone.

    *Apple Watch app usage requires "Allow data access on your Apple Watch app" to be enabled on the iPhone app.

    - Printing & Export To PDF Support! You can now export an individual entry or all of your Personal Diary data for printing or just for archiving your data.

    And other random updates like:

    - The new iPad Pros & iOS 12.1 are now supported as well!
    - The App Store Screenshots are updated to make them more interesting. ;)
    - Notifications now allow you to directly select "Create New Entry" (by 3D touching the notification) and instantly jump into a new entry within the app and start writing.

    And some bug fixes:
    - Fixed random animation glitches when deleting an entry.
    - Removed animations for users on iOS 9 due to an animation glitch that only occurs persistently on iOS 9.
    - Fixed bugs regarding the app not detecting a new iCloud sign in properly and therefore would not display iCloud content until an app refresh is performed.

Version 2.4.19 (Oct 26, 2018)
    What's this update? New features added, while most bugs should be squashed. Hopefully they don't reproduce.

    - Killed a bug where the Timeline just decides not to chronologically sort your entries and jumble up your entries if you've modified the dates so that it isn't referring to 'now', until you summon it to reload by pulling down to refresh.
    - Squashed a bug causing the app to be stubborn and nag you to write in your diary even if you have already written earlier.
    - Annihilated a bug that made the app be lazy and not want to automatically select the latest weather as it can see from the sky, but rather just based on its memory, guesses the weather based on info a few hours to days ago.
    - Removed a bug where hiding entry preview literally hides the preview of everything, i.e. it also hides whether or not an entry is downloaded.
    - Added the ability to toggle whether to use randomness when notifications are sent.
    - Adds more information to clarify when to expect a reply from me after sending an email.
    - Adds a Tipping Jar for supporting the development of the app, since some of you are willing to do so. Thank you for supporting Personal Diary :)
    - Slightly updated splash screen which now also indicates the version number of the app, and shows detailed loading progress of the app.
    - Reordered some of the settings from within the app.
    - Added random Easter eggs but I won't tell you what are they. ;)



    If you have any issues with the app, feel free to send an email to lwjdev@gmail.com. Hope you enjoy using Personal Diary :)

    - Data backup support
    - Headers in the mood picker to speed up the selection process.

Version 2.4.8 (Jun 4, 2018)
    Version 2.4.8 fixes an issue where specifically turning on Face ID will cause the app to crash when relaunched. Plus, if you're like me and always forget to write your diary even with the convenience of a phone, the app can now give you a friendly nudge to do so.

    Honestly though, the version 2.4.6 changelog is nice. Just that there are two new versions to fix some bugs. It would seem boring to have a plain changelog here, so I'm gonna leave most of them below, plus updates from 2.4.7 and 2.4.8.

Version 2.4.5 (Jan 25, 2018)
    This minor update (v2.4.5):
    - Fixes an issue where entries might turn white, causing unselectable white "gaps" in the Timeline. Don't worry, this bug did not cause any data loss.
    - Performed some fixes and improvements to make the app more responsive.

    Main release (v2.4):

    Welcome to this new update of Personal Diary 2.4!

    This new update has *so little* new features you won't even notice. (*NO* easter eggs included)

    Just download this update and you will see *nothing* new, not even faster performance, bug fixes, slight UI changes, improvements to entries created in the same day, new messages pop up and under the hood improvements. And *NO* compatibility with any new iPhone such as the iPhone X.






    ps: - disclaimer, it's the opposite.

    Okay enough jokes, you should understand what's added by now. By the way, I'm still developing an [export] functionality into the app due to multiple user requests, and it will be released in version 2.5 once ready. Stay tuned!
Version 2.4.3 (Nov 28, 2017)
    This minor update (v2.4.3):
    - fixes an issue caused by v2.4.2 where the "2" is replaced with "z...e" in the password field.

    This minor update (v2.4.2):
    - fixes an issue caused by v2.4.1 to not allow users to turn on or turn off Touch ID/Face ID. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

    This minor update (v2.4.1):
    - fixes an issue which prevents you to scroll to another area while keyboard is displayed.
    - fixes an issue which causes the text cursor to jump to the end when editing an entry and not to start at where you have tapped.
    - fixes user interface which does not reference Touch ID & Face ID properly.
    - improved user interface when in the locked state.
    - slightly improved the responsiveness of the app.

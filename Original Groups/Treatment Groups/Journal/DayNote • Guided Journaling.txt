App Description
Welcome to DayNote.

Our goal with DayNote is to help you discover something lost during the day - the moment to pause and answer some of life's most important questions.

As a guided journal, DayNote becomes a place where thoughts are recorded and collected as answers to four significant questions.

These questions are:

What did you learn?
What did you achieve?
What were your good experiences?
What can I improve?

And that's all you have to do. Preferably daily, but if not, as often as you can, answer these questions to the best of your ability.

Over time, as you create journal entries, a wealth of knowledge tailored to your experiences will grow and become increasingly valuable to your personal growth.

With DayNote, remember what you learnt, be proud of your achievements and reminisce positive memories.

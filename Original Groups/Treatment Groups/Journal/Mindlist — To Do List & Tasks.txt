FEATURES OF MINDLIST:
• NO ADS! No distraction or intrusion from ads when you use Mindlist. We want you to focus on managing your tasks and schedule.
• REMINDERS: Mindlist helps remind you of your upcoming appointments, meetings, deadlines, or things to do. Please allow Notification so we can end you reminders for things you need to do.
• CALENDAR: visualize your work or schedule with our calendar. Plan your daily life starting from the moment you wake until you go to bed easily.
• CUSTOMIZE YOUR TASK LIST: customize icon color, icon shapes, enable / disable hiding completed tasks, and highlight overdue tasks.
• SIMPLE & FAST: our app is minimalist so it’s very easy to see where everything is and also very intuitive. To add tasks, just tap Add new tasks, then Edit to add the name of the task, set in on your calendar, activate reminder, and set if it’s a repeating task.
• DARK (NIGHT) MODE: Automatically change to dark mode at night time for better visibility.
• ORGANIZE LISTS: Simply drag and move the list to organize them.
Although our app is FREE to use, we have Premium features you can unlock with very low cost, less than a cost of a latte. If you enjoy using Mindlist, please consider getting our Premium version. You only need to unlock it ONCE and you can use all premium features forever.

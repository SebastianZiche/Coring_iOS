TenYear Diary - journal & memo
Record treasured memories
Lifestyle (Applications)
Free
App Description
Every page covers 10 years.
Ten Year Diary is a truly special way to record your most treasured memories.

Where were you six years ago? What was on your mind?
Wouldn't you love to read those thoughts today?

Record your activities, thoughts, feelings & memories. Each Daily Page covers a single date. The page is divided into 10 sections, one for each year, with four lines for each individual daily entry. Enough room to record the day's events without the burden of creating a lengthy entry. Each year you will record your entry for that date on the same page, and so you get to look back and relive all your wonderful memories from past years.

Our memories are our most treasured possession but with time all memories fade. Enjoy reading about your children growing up. Or your grandchildren. What was your child doing this same day last year? Every time you make an entry in our ten year journal you can see what was happening in your life on that day in years past.

•Takes just 5 minutes a day
•No pressure to fill a blank page
•Builds over time into a family memoir
•As you make each entry you see what was happening on that day in previous years
•Re-reading triggers memories of people, place and events otherwise forgotten
•Captures personal and family development and milestones

Just scribble down a few sentences each day and, before you know it, you have a decade of memories and observations at your fingertips! Each "daily page" of the 10 Year Journal offers room to write about one day - March 6th, say - every time it comes around from 2014 to 2024 (start any time in 2014). What fun to compare what was happening in your life on any given day as the years go by. The subject matter is totally up to you...record what you do or how you feel, what your children say or do, what you eat or what you read, financial data or medical notes, local weather or world events - be creative! This unique diary will quickly become a treasured possession.

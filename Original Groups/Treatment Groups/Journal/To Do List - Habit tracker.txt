App Description
Handy habit tracker and task planner. With a plan of regular and one-time tasks.

Application features:
- Creation of one-time and regular tasks (habits);
- Creation of multi-component tasks (for example, drink "8 glasses of water");
- Setting up reminders for individual tasks;
- Statistics of habits;
- Create notes;
- Synchronization with the cloud
- Set password
- Filter notes by type for easy tracking of changes;
- easy and clear design will also make the process of introducing new habits attractive.

Track progress and task completion statistics and get inspired by it. What can motivate you better than your own success?

The "Notes" function allows you to write down everything that is important to you:
- parameter changes,
- interesting observations,
- mood,
any symptoms, etc.

The application is as simple and flexible as possible!

We treated the creation of this application with trepidation and attention, because we know how exciting the process of self-development is.

If you have ideas for improving the application, we will be glad to see them on our email: track-diary@yandex.ru

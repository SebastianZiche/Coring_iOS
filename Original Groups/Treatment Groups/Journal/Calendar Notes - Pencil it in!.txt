    Hey everyone, I am sorry this update has taken so long, especially since there are so many bugs in version 3. Hurricane Ian significantly damaged my home/office, and I have been without power or internet. Anyways Starlink arrived today, so updates should start consistently rolling out again.

    If you are one of the users who experienced data loss, please follow the steps outlined here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201398
    NOTE: Step #4 may itself result in new data loss, so only proceed with it as a last measure.

    If the steps above don't resolve your issue, please email support@databenice.com with:
    1. your device iOS versions
    2. the Pencil it in! App Versions
    3. A description what/how much data is missing

    Thanks for your patience,

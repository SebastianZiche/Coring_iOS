    In the meantime, we have operated an upgrade system through paid payment within YOUKAMI. But I decided to switch the operation to a full free method (advertising) because of the difficulty of the confused YOUKAMI payment method. In the future, instead of randomly appearing ads while using the app, you can watch as many ads as you want and write a diary. It's a way to charge 2 times per 1 viewing. If you are tired of watching advertisements, you can download and use the official version of YOUKA. We will always listening to your inconvenience. Thank you.

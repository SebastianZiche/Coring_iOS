IMPORTANT INFORMATION

The MindDoc App is a risk class I medical product according to Annex VIII, Rule 11 of the MDR (REGULATION (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices)

Intended Medical Purpose:

The MindDoc monitoring and self-management application medical device provides continuous long-term sign and symptom monitoring of common mental disorders. This protocol is supplemented by courses and exercises. This enables users to recognize patterns in their symptom trajectories which then can be shared with a mental health care provider and used for self-management.

MindDoc thus

provides users orientation regarding the need to consult a mental health care provider by providing an assessment of the general emotional health. A mental health care provider then can include the summary of the protocols in his overall diagnostic and clinical assessment.

enables users to self-manage symptoms and related problems by providing both transdiagnostic and disorder-specific evidence-based courses and exercises which help them to recognize, understand, and cope with signs and symptoms of mental disorders by self-initiating behavior change.

The application explicitly does not replace the diagnosis by a mental health care provider, but can only give orientation on whether to consult a mental health care provider who then can include the results of the medical device in diagnostic processes.

The application explicitly does not replace psychotherapy.

Please read the regulatory information (e.g., warnings) and instruction for use as provided on our medical device site: https://minddoc.com/medizinprodukt

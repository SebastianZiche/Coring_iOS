App Description
Thoughtsy is the easiest to use journaling app, that stays in your text messages like your best friend. Once a day, you will receive a text from Thoughtsy checking in to see how you feel. Simply respond with a thought, feeling, or summary of your day, and Thoughtsy will save it away.

Using artificial intelligence and sentiment analysis, Thoughtsy will score and organize all your thoughts for you. By simply texting back one time a day, you start to build a history of your entire life. It takes less than a minute, but will give a lifetime of memories.

Journaling every day can improve your productivity, your mood, and your mental health. Look back in time to see your best days, or your worst. We all have both. It is the practice that counts.

Thoughtsy offers auto-renewing subscriptions:
- $3.99 billed monthly
- $23.99 billed annually

You will receive 7 free text messages to start, and after that will have to subscribe. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal at the total subscription price within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions and auto-renewals may be managed or canceled via your iTunes Account settings.

These prices are in US dollars (USD). Pricing in other currencies and countries may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.

App Description
LazyDiary is a diary app that specializes in "keeping going".

LazyDiary was developed based on the developer's own problem of not being able to keep up with any diary.

- Record as if you were taking notes.
If you try to write perfectly, you will not know where to start.
LazyDiary allows you to keep a diary in a simple and easy manner by recording what happened in fragments, line by line, just like a note.
Even on days when you are tired, you can keep a diary as if it were a note, making it easy to continue to keep a diary every day.
Of course, you can also record detailed information.

- Never be at a loss for things to write about.
LazyDiary automatically displays your schedule for the day by connecting to your calendar.
This makes it easy to look back on the day and smoothly start writing in the diary.
Even if you forget to keep a diary for a few days, you can easily keep a diary by checking the day's schedule.

- Daily notifications make it a habit.
Daily notifications help you keep a diary habit by sending you notifications at set times each day.

- Simple design that you will never get tired of.
Because it is an app that you touch every day, we paid special attention to the design.
The simple design allows you to keep track of your daily activities intuitively without getting lost in the operations.

- Security.
You can set a password when you start the app to further enhance your privacy.
You can also unlock the app with fingerprint or face-ID.

App Promotional Text
The use of this diary can help individuals with neurosis better understand their thoughts, emotions and behaviours.
App Description
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that helps individuals identify and change unhelpful or unhealthy thought patterns and behaviours. The goal of CBT is to positively influence a person’s emotions, behaviour and overall wellbeing. CBT can be used to treat a variety of issues, such as depression, anxiety, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. It helps people develop beneficial coping strategies and improve their problem-solving skills.

A CBT diary is a tool that is used to record events, thoughts, emotions, body reactions, behaviours, rational responses and cognitive distortions. It is used to track progress over time and help individuals learn more about their thought and behaviour patterns. The diary can also be used to set goals and develop strategies for improving mental health. By writing down their thoughts, emotions, and behaviours, individuals can gain greater insight into their own behaviour and gain new perspectives on the challenges they are facing.

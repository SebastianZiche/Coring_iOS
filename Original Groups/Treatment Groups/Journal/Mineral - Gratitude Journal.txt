App Description
In a time where our mind is often on overdrive being mindful of the best things in life can spark ease and clarity to focus on the positive.
Mineral supports you by making it easy to savour the best moments of the day big or small allowing for a boost in positive energy.

Why?
Building a rhythm that allows for giving space to dwell on everyday treasures allows for you to retract from a world of big data and consumerism to a space of your own. In this space what you value increasingly becomes more apparent to you and may guide you to choose what to do more and what to do less to increase your level of happiness.

It’s not easy to create new habits which is why Mineral is created to support you on this path. Mineral will make sure you get notified every day at a time convenient for you.
Repetition is key to make this work. By tracking each day you will hopefully see an increase in happiness and feel better the more you use mineral.

Our minds has a tendency to not focus on the best moments on life. Mineral is here to train your mind to allow focus on the positive, not only of the practical, complex and the difficult.

Essentially, Mineral is your personal positivity Journal. You can use it to write down things that makes you happy and things that you are grateful for.

What's New

Version 1.4 (Feb 14, 2024)
    We fixed the bug in the onboarding flow to improve the transition between screens.

    Hope you enjoy using Mineral :)
Version 1.1 (Aug 3, 2023)
    A few weeks back we finally released Mineral. An idea that’s been brewing for almost 3 years.
    Mineral is a simple Gratitude Journal designed to help you appreciate the positive moments in life, both big and small.

    We are grateful that you have chosen to embark on a journey of gratitude with us.

    In this update, we've introduced a few improvements and refinements to enhance your overall app experience:

    - Real-time Date Headers: We've fixed a bug to make sure the date headers are always up-to-date. No more confusion with entries listed as "Today" when they were actually from yesterday. The app now accurately differentiates between "Today" and "Yesterday".
    - Enhanced Input Field: We've added a fresh shine to the input field for a delightful experience.
    - New App Icons: To keep things exciting, we've introduced new app icons.
    - Revamped About Screen: The about screen has been polished and tidied up for better readability and a more pleasant user experience.

    With these improvements, we aim to make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing. We hope you enjoy these updates as much as we enjoyed making them!

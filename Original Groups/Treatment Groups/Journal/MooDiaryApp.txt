App Description
[Why You Should Have It]

"MooDiaryApp is a simple app designed to help you record your daily life. In today's world, where people are often influenced by social media and experience heightened levels of anxiety, MooDiary offers a solution. By using this app, you can shift your focus back to yourself and truly appreciate the uniqueness and preciousness of your own life.




[Features]

- Monthly Mood Calendar
Record your feelings by tapping specific days or the '+' icon on the tab bar for today's mood. Access previous records by tapping the icon below the calendar date.

- Simple daily recording with emojis and photos
Adding a day to the app is simple. Choose to either tap the emoji or fill in all the details. Use the circular slider to select sleep time, and add a brief description if desired.

- Mood flow and Sleep Tracking
The app creates monthly charts based on your daily mood and sleep records, allowing you to easily track your mental and physical well-being.

- Auto-generated monthly memoir
When adding more than five pictures in a month, this feature will be activated. 'Moodiary' will automatically generate a monthly memoir for you, utilizing the photos you've added during that month.

- Secure diary storage
You can set a password for your diary in order to ensure its security and make your secrets safe.

- Mood recording with Siri
No need to open the app for recording. Just ask Siri to 'Record Mood' and assign a score for today. Siri will automatically write the mood in your diary.



[How to Add Your Daily Mood Score to 'Moodiary' Using Siri]

(Part 1: Initial Setup) - Only needs to be done once

2. Add 'Moodiary' as your new shortcut and select the 'Record Mood' action.

(Part 2: Activating Siri)

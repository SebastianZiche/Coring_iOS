Take a look at how you feel during a month with five mood beans. If you click on the bean, you can check the record you left that day right away.

○ Tap the mood beans and activity icons for a simple record
Let's choose your mood for the day and summarize the day with colorful icons. You can add a picture and a line of notes.

○ Category blocks that allow you to select only the categories you want
Blocks can be added or deleted whenever you want, and categories will be updated continuously.

○ Statistics that analyze mood and activity on a weekly/monthly basis
Look at your mood flow through statistics and see what activities affect your mood. You can also check the number of icon records on a weekly and monthly basis.

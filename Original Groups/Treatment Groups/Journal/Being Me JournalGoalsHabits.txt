"I've never felt motivated to write an app review before! I'm feeling more positive and motivated in all areas and I'm actually getting things done! Really grateful and highly recommended Being Me!"
- One of thousands of 5-star reviews for Being Me

* WHAT IS BEING ME?

In a world that's constantly comparing and pulling us in so many directions, Being Me is your place to JUST BE YOU! It's the ONLY app that combines a Journal, Goals and Habits into one simple and powerful package.

- Reflect and deepen your self-understanding
- Track your moods and gain insight
- Save precious memories including PHOTOS
- Set goals and make progress
- Build habits and keep yourself accountable

* DON'T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

"This app saved me from myself! I have way more self-awareness and way more self-confidence. It has helped me so much and made my days more positive! I highly recommend!!"

"I really love this app! I love tracking my habits and goals and reading the daily quotes that keep my mind focused. The photos are amazingly lovely! One of my gratitudes today was this app itself!"

"This app is a must! It has helped me with my anxiety and depression so much. I was looking for help and didn't know where to turn. Now I do! Thank you!!"

* DESIGNED BY EXPERTS

Being Me is based on principles from mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. The exercises follow the journaling practices of celebrities, therapists and experts including Oprah, Tim Ferris, Arianna Huffington and many more. Every part of the app is designed to help you be your best self!

* BENEFITS

- Greater self-love, joy and confidence
- A private place to store your memories and special moments
- Stress & anxiety relief
- Better self-care
- Help managing difficult emotions like sadness, fear and anger

* HOW IT WORKS

The JOURNAL gives you a variety of ways to reflect. You can follow a guided approach with exercises and fresh daily reflections every day. Or you can choose from a number of freeform entries including memories, moods, learnings, vents and more.

The GOALS module is simple. You design goals that are aligned with your life purpose and values. We'll help you check-in and stay on track until they're achieved!

The HABIT tracker makes it easy to stay accountable. Easily track your progress with simple CHARTS and GRAPHS. Reminders make it easy to remember!

* PRIVACY

App Description
Moody lets you track your moods and keep a private journal with just a few taps. No typing required!

Log a mood and tag your activities, mood triggers, and even the weather. Add a note and/or a photo if you're so inclined. Moody makes journaling effortless.

Moody's simple journal feed contains a FILTER that will allow you to see only entries that contain a certain activity/trigger, mood, rating, or weather.

Moody's powerful summary page will give you a tally of moods, activities/triggers, ratings, and more over a span of time (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 365 days).

Moody is a simple, fully customizable tool to help you learn more about yourself, your actions, and your behaviors.

Moody Features:
• Log a mood in seconds. Optionally log a note, photo, activities, and the weather as well.
• 1000+ icons to choose from to make your own mood, activity, and weather icons.
• Totally customizable. Create an icon for any mood, activity, and weather that you choose.
• A journal FILTER can show only entries with a certain mood, rating, weather, or activity.
• A powerful STATS page will show you a tally of your moods, activities, weather, and a graph of your moods over time.
• Set reminders and never forget to log an entry.
• Dark/Light background mode.

Moody is FREE to try for 15 entries. For unlimited entries, upgrade to PREMIUM.

Moody PREMIUM Features:
• Unlimited entries.
• Set a private passcode to keep your entries private.
• Export your data as a CSV file that you can open in any spreadsheet program.

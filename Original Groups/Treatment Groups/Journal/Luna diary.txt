App Description
■ Monthly Challenge for New Themes
Write 7 notes in a month and earn one of the premium themes as this month's special theme.
We've infused the spirit of developing a daily writing habit for the new year.
It's okay to fail repeatedly. As long as you don't give up, we're always here to support your challenges.

■ New Themes Added Each Month
From moon, stars, and flower illustrations to beautiful artwork, we've prepared various themes to decorate your home screen.
Choose themes that suit your taste and create your own memory space.
New emotional characters with different concepts like cute cookies along with the moon are also being added.

■ The Moon that Expresses Your Day
Assigning your own meanings to the moon's shape or emojis allows you to use it as a diary for various themes.
Set meaning as satisfaction for a diet diary.
Use gratitude for a gratitude diary.
Cute emotional emojis can be used for a mood diary.

Many find psychological comfort by sharing their feelings with the moon, especially during times of stress, depression, loneliness, or when in need of comfort.
The daily records written on the moon will safeguard your emotions.

■ Growing Emotional Landscape with Each Entry
The more you use the diary app, the more flowers and stars will appear.
The moon gets filled according to the number of diaries written in a month.
Just like the growing flowers and stars and the filling moon, your heart will also become enriched.

■ Glass Cards that Support You
Encouragement sent to yourself is more powerful than from anyone else.
Write phrases for yourself on a glass card and use them when times are tough.
The more you use the cards, the clearer they become, offering a small strength to live through today.

■ Monthly Reflection
View statistics of the writings and the trajectory of the moon filled with your emotions over the month.
The meanings you have saved are visually represented in the moon's trajectory, allowing for easy analysis.
Reflection is available to everyone, not just premium users.

■ Various Convenient Features
Keep your secret diary safe with a lock feature.
Embed multiple photos, videos, and music in your entries.
Add a moon-shaped widget to your home screen to display a beautiful moon. Seeing the moon in your wallpaper will inspire you to write diaries.
Categorize diaries with hashtags to view only the ones you want.
When unsure where to start, use our diary templates. Answering template questions makes diary writing a bit easier.

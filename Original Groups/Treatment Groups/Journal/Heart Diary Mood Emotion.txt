App Description
Blink, and a day's gone.What did you feel? Capture your emotions in words


Do you know

When you are happy?
When you feel excited?
When you are sad?
When you are angry?
When you feel anxious?

Most people don't really understand their own emotions.

Because they don't know,

They can't fully enjoy moments of happiness,
And they are deeply hurt in difficult times.

When exciting moments come to you, recognize them and fully experience them.
Such moments don't come often.

These memories enrich your life.

Increase happy events,
Decrease sad ones,

And create a happier life.

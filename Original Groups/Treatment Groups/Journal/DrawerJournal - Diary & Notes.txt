    - When a single image is posted on the calendar screen, adjust the size so that the entire image is visible.
    - We have received many comments from people who take pictures of their food or their dog, but they would have preferred to see the entire picture like before, so we have made this change. Our team holds review meetings every week, so please continue to let us know your various opinions.

    Now, as for this update

    This time, we have added the photo submission function, which has been requested by many users. Now that you can add photos, the range of expression is much wider, and it's great to record your feelings about sunflowers on the side of the road, a sunny day, or a delicious meal.

    The app's icon has been revamped with the help of an amazing designer. With the help of a very talented designer, the app's icons have been redesigned to create a completely new atmosphere that will make you want to keep using it. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, thank you!

    We've added an icon at the top of the screen to make it easier to see the month and week views of the calendar, as requested by users. So we added an icon at the top of the screen.

    We've also received a request from a user who wanted to go back to a post he wrote a long time ago, so we've made it possible to travel back in time by tapping on the month part of the calendar.

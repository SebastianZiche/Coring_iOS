App Description
Seasons is a simple and creative digital journaling and note taking app. Stay organized with multiple journals, express your creativity with countless designs and stickers, and document your thoughts and feelings to help you reflect and grow.

After a quick introduction, users can immediately begin creating journals and journal entries. Your reflections and notes can be in the form of text, photos, or audio recordings. Tag your journal entries with mood emojis and use our helpful charts to track your mood over time. To help you stay focused and organized, journals can be created in one of five categories (Personal, Health, Work, Learning or Relationships). And just in case you have trouble figuring out what to write or post about, we also provide a number of prompts that can be answered to help you practice mindfulness and jumpstart your reflections.

Customize the look and feel of your journals with a broad selection of unique designs. Personalize and style your journals with endless combinations of background images, patterns, frames, journal bands, and stickers. We are continually adding new ways for you to express yourself and make your journals your own!

If you would like to share your journal with others, we also provide the ability to invite those closest to you to form group journals. This is ideal for the friends, family, therapists, coaches and mentors in our lives who help keep us motivated and accountable. Their support, along with features like positive affirmation notifications and calendar scheduling, will help you make journaling an indispensable part of your self care routine.

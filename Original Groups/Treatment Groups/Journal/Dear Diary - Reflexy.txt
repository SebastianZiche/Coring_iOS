App Description
Welcome to a journey of self-discovery and personal growth with Reflexy. Let's see how using the app will help you feel better.

Record the moments that matter, just like entries in a diary. In Reflexy, each 'Story' captures a specific situation or event in your life, offering a space to reflect and understand your experiences. It’s about focusing on the details that shape your narrative, one story at a time.

When analyzing a story in Reflexy, start by separating the non-judgmental 'what has happened' from 'what do I feel regarding that.'

It's about distinguishing the event itself from your personal emotional response, and realizing that it is something within you that causes it.

Ask yourself, 'Why do I feel this way?'. Explore beyond your feelings to uncover the underlying needs.

With the insights gained, recognize that there are many ways for them to be satisfied. Choose the one that truly resonate with "who you are", and set a conscious aim feeling responsible and powerful.

As you set new goals, new activities naturally become a part of your life. Watch how they bring about new stories.

Monitor the changing amount of stress, anxiety, sadness and depression, bipolar and sickness symptoms as well as undesired behaviour like binge eating or over drinking.

With this cyclic process, every day is a step towards a more mindful, fulfilled you.

The suggested approach is inspired by Marshall B. Rosenberg "Nonviolent Comunication. A Language of Life".

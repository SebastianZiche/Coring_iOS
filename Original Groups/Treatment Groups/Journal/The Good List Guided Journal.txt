App Description
What if you could live a happier and more meaningful life by investing just a few minutes a day?
Using research-based practices, The Good List is your guide to a more fulfilling life. All of the content in the app is based on decades of research and analysis done at prestigious institutions like UC Berkley, Yale, Harvard, Duke, University of Pennsylvania, and more. 

The Good List can make practicing these skills easy by choosing from curated pathways carefully designed to meet your goals or browse the full catalogue of practices to pick whichever one speaks to you.

Science has shown gratitude, connection, self-compassion and purpose to be key components of a more fulfilling life. Science has also shown that all of these skills can be learned with practice.

Just as we must practice to learn other skills like playing the guitar or piano, or learning a new language, practicing these mindfulness skills will help us live a happier and more fulfilling life and make them part of our daily lives.

• Be happier - Research-based practices to help you lead a happier and more fulfilled life.
• Control stress & anxiety - Breathing and meditation practices to help with stress and anxiety.
• Guidance - Structured programs to help reach your personal, relationship and career goals.
• Variety - Hundreds of practices that include guided journaling, meditation, breathwork and audio guides.
• Trust - Learn the science behind the practices with audio-guides and links to digestible research.
• Private and secure - End-to-end encryption ensures that only you have access to your data.
• Easy to use at night - Dark mode to help lessen the impact on your eyes at night.
• Enable Apple Health to track mindful minutes

The growing list of research-based practices include:
• Gratitude journal
• Three good things
• Acts of kindness
• Silver lining
• Body scan
• Loving-kindness mediation
• Character strengths
• Self-compassion
• Awe
• Best possible self
• Box breathing

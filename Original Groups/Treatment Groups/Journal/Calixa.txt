Wellness self-experiment guide

App Description
Calixa is your self-experiment guide to help with the formation of healthy habits.

Habit formation takes time, so why not have an app accompany you on a journey to try out something new, one day at a time - with engaging reminders and easy to understand health and wellness content.

Do you get excited by a new wellness topic and think to yourself wow it would be really freaking cool to try this to see how it would affect me and sort of commit to it but then forget entirely the next day? Yeah, me too. That’s why Calixa is designed to keep you going with self-discovery through entertaining, bite-sized content that will be delivered over a period of time. That way you have enough time to both internalize a concept and implement it - without the overhead of doing it all by yourself.

Self-experiments
Calixa works under the premise that anything is hackable so we can move forward in life with new realizations and understanding of ourselves.
You will find a library of self-experiments ranging from using food to boost neurotransmitter formation to understanding the psychology behind manifestation. We will list relevant research studies whenever possible so you can quench your curiosity. We will also increase your motivation by sending daily reminders while you’re progressing through the experiment.

Logging
A big part of Calixa is logging mood and activities in just a minute - with a minimalist interface that won’t deplete your daily will power supply. You can log with or without an ongoing self-experiment. It’s a way to make connections between your daily inputs and how they affect how they ultimately make you feel - a precious insight into your patterns. Mood includes your general mood, your zen levels, creativity and motivation. Activities include food, physical activity and miscellaneous self-care activities like meditation, socialization, sexytime etc.

Graphs
In the stats tab you will find your mood graphs - beautifully visualized to track the variations in your emotional and creative landscape. Visualize mood over the past week or a whole month all together. Click on mood data points to see mood details and the food/activity inputs for that day.

Wellness Content
In addition to self-experiments/habit journeys, you will have access to a library of wellness topics. These are broken down into What, Why and How so you always have the option to implement what you’re learning - bite sized, simple to understand and engaging as always.

The primary focus of Calixa is making complex wellness topics accessible and interesting to the public through easy to understand and entertaining language.

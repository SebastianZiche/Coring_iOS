App Description
Have you ever stopped to notice how much of what goes on in your mind isn't under your own control and how much of your behavior is influenced by those uncontrolled parts? Most of it goes by each day unexamined and barely noticed. Much of it causes us stress. But, when you start to examine this unknown or pull it apart, you can have some truly fulfilling insights and experiences.

That's where Bodhi comes in. Almost inevitably, you'll find yourself confronting uncomfortable or embarrassing memories, and our app helps you organize them, relate them, and draw insights from them. We can't yet give you the insights, but we're here to help you figure it out. We'll store the breadcrumbs so you can find your way back!

Key Features:
- Organize events in your timeline
- Connect events any way you see fit
- Our AI-powered chatbot helps prompt you to remember
- Share your timeline with coaches, mentors, or therapist with our web tools

App Description
Scribble Journey provides guided activities that focus on drawing paired with journaling for people who want to dive deeper into their emotions.

The process is simple. Choose an emotion to focus on, then let Scribble Journey guide you through a drawing and journaling activity. Each activity is designed to help your brain discover shiny, new insights that can smooth the path of your mental health journey.

Activities focus on:
* Anxiety
* Confidence
* Focus
* Gratitude
* Happiness

Haven’t picked up a crayon since you were a kid? No worries, Scribble Journey’s instructional prompts provide simple steps to ease you into your creation. The activities are simple enough for someone who finds drawing daunting and broad enough that a professional creative can add their own complexity if desired.

The end goal isn’t to create a masterpiece, but to dive deeper into your emotions and get more in tune with your mental health.

If you have any questions, suggestions or any other feedback, please email support@scribblejourney.com.

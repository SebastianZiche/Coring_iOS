Now you can see at a glance how your mood usually changes throughout the day. You can even tap on a time slot to get more stats and read through all the linked entries.

This new time chart is fully customizable and can also be hidden if you feel that it s not applicable for you e.g. if you create just one entry per day . Since we were working on improving the analytical part of our app we ve made improvements to the distribution chart: Tap on ... right next to the headline to show a new alternative graph. Also you can now tap on any mood within the distribution chart to open a details page. We ve additionally improved the analytics details page for the weekday: Now there s also a list of events and activities.

Browsing and reading through your mood diary entries is much easier now. The Timeline view lets you see nearly all details of your created entries in a compressed view that also visualizes which entries were created on the same day. You can enable the Timeline view by tapping on the icon in the upper left hand corner on the Home screen. Tap again to switch back to the default view. Additionally you can now load more than 10 entries on the home screen. How Just scroll down to the very bottom of the list and tap on More . This combined with the new Timeline view lets you read through all of your diary entries from beginning to end without any break. Since we were already working on improving the readability of diary entries we ve also given the entry details screen a small makeover: The edit mode looks much cleaner since we ve moved the Delete button to the very bottom of the screen. Good news for people using external keyboards: Moodistory is now optimized for that. As always we ve also corrected some bugs and made minor layout optimizations. Last but not least we would like to give the iPhone 12 family a warm welcome! Our app is now also optimized to run on iPhone 12 Mini iPhone 12 iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. : A final note: Moodistory s development is driven by the feedback of our users.

From now on you can add images and photos to your diary entries. We ve tinkered with the design to integrate them in a pleasant and natural way. The result is an interactive image view: By default you will just see a user defined cropped image but if you tap on it the whole image becomes visible. If you tap and hold on the image the image opens in fullscreen. Now you can zoom and scroll just like you re used from the Photos app. If you swipe down to or tap and hold again you can close the fullscreen. Of course all images can also be printed to a PDF document. Also the data backup will include all images along with the journal data. Speaking of data backup there is now a progress indicator that gives you an idea of how long it will take to finish. Up until now the data backup was a matter of seconds. But with images the data can get quite large. That s why we ve added a progress indicator. Regarding minor changes we ve added icons for Plus and Minus . As always we ve also fixed minor bugs: corrected daily view scrolling position theme deletion now also works for user created themes changing colors of an active theme now works correctly. As a final note to this update we would like to thank YOU for your support and the continuous feedback we receive. Only with your help are we able to make the great mood tracking app that we aim for.

Powered by the precious feedback that we ve received from the best of all: our users : New features: As you know Moodistory comes with a set of events to describe your day. You can fully customize those events but none of those changes could be reverted. From now on you can! Go into Menu Settings Events list categories Defaults to find all options to restore an event or whole event categories. We received some feedback that during entry creation you would like to skip some steps and e.g. only record your mood. That s why there s now a Quicksave button. Just tap on the page indicators on the top in the middle to bring up this button. Tap again to proceed and skip any following screens. You can now change Moodistory s app icon background color so the app fits even better to all the other app icons on your iPhone.

Since iOS 13 it is possible to change the language of any app that supports more than one language. Just open the app s setting from your iPhone Settings and look for Language . To make things easier there s a shortcut to that setting within Moodistory: Go into Menu Settings Events list categories Customize Moodistory Change language. For technical reasons event names categories may still be in the previously set language but you can automatically translate them just go into Menu Settings Events list categories Defaults Switched language. Improvements: For those who are already familiar with Moodistory and just did a fresh install you can now skip the tutorial: On the welcome screen enter your name and tap on the text Skip tutorial . We ve also fixed a few bugs most important ones being: The list of reminders is now sorted also for 12h time format. The location selection screen now uses the correct colors even if your iPhone is set to dark mode. Renaming categories will now make sure that you are not creating doubles.

Just as a heads up: We re going to give you more customization options for icons in one of our future updates so you will also be able to use any emoji and more .

We got the feedback that icons about the weather would be helpful so we created 12 new icons and put them into a new category called Weather . We ve also added icons for Guitar Playground Lock Computer and Going to the park . Additionally we ve improved the PDF Export. There s now a new selection for the time range Last Month and very long texts are now handled in a better way.

With our new update we did focus on the smaller things in Moodistory and fixed a few minor bugs. Thank you so much for the feedback that we ve received in the last 2 weeks! Since we are keeping track of all ideas the more feedback we receive the better Moodistory will get and the more it will fit your needs.

1335347860,1000800000223538,Emotion Tracker Moodistory,Health and Fitness,2018-08-03,2018-07-31,36.28,8,1,0,1,1.8,2019-10-09,This brand new update is one of the biggest we ve ever released to this day and we re super excited to finally bring it to you! All new features that are listed below are there thanks to the many feedbacks we ve received from you! Thank you so much for every single one who has taken the time to send feedback and ideas. But let s continue to the new features: We ve not just added new themes for Moodistory you can now even change existing or create your own individual themes. Finally YOU can decide if dark green is more positive than light green or the other way around. We also wanted to give you more choices when it comes to the scaling of your mood. We originally thought that a 6 point scale fits perfectly. But we ve learned that this doesn t fit everyone some users were especially missing a neutral mood. Therefore you now have the option to define the range of the mood scale: Choose any range between a 2 point up to an 11 point scale. But what if you already have a lot of diary entries and now would like to switch the scale No problem! You just have to make a link between the old and the new rating levels. Moodistory fully supports this approach so you can switch to any mood scale no matter if you have already created entries. Another new feature is the option to set the start of the week. Previously Moodistory would automatically use the start of the week that is set on your iPhone. But now you can simply override this. While iOS 13 introduced cool new features it also introduced a few layout glitches to Moodistory. However this is now a thing of the past. Our list of activities events has again increased since we ve added 4 new items for Binge eating Throw up Sick leave and Take meds .

It s again an updated that is all about the feedback that we have received! Thank you so much your feedback is the fuel to improve Moodistory! : But let s get right into the details of what is new in this update: We ve thoroughly reworked the reminders. Since we have the feature for random reminders for quite some time we thought that we could also add an option for random notification sounds. Meaning you can now create random notifications with random sounds. Of course you can also just simply select a specific reminder sound for a notification. We ve created 8 completely new and exclusive sounds just for Moodistory let us know if you like them! Reworking the reminders did also solve an issue where und certain conditions random reminders would sometimes not show at all. This is now a thing of the past! But we ve not just worked on the reminders we ve started to work on improving the accessibility for people with blindness by supporting VoiceOver. Also we ve improved the backup restore feature. Backups will not be saved as a zip archive taking much less space on your phone. Of course existing backups can still be restored and always will! . There s a now a new option for the PDF Export: Sorting. You can now decide whether you would like to see newer entries first or older entries first in the PDF document. Last but not least we ve fixed a few bugs. We are super excited about this update and hope that you like especially the new notification tones! : Let us know what you think about Moodistory!

A lot of changes were made under the hood to make the app smoother overall. But our main focus has been of course your feedback! Thanks to you Moodistory hast improved! : Find out what is new and has changed: The sequence of months on the calendar is now the same as in any other calendar app. Previously the calendar showed the latest month at the top. This came with one disadvantage: When time passes and a new month starts it was hard to read the mood patterns. The solution to this issue was straight forward: we ve reordered the sequence of the months just like you are used from your default calendar app. Also we ve significantly improved the calendar loading time for large amounts of entries. The avatar Miyo can now always be maximized. Previously you could only see the avatar s text when you were at the top of the page. Now no matter if you are at the top of a page or somewhere in the middle you can simply tap the avatar to see the text. Tap it again to make it disappear. Added new function back to start . E.g. If you are on the calendar and want to go directly to the current month then you can hit the calendar icon again and Moodistory will scroll automatically to the current month. Added new item Customize in settings. There you can change for the entry creation screen whether swiping left will result in a positive mood OR in a negative mood. Added new activities events for ice skating handball cricket gymnastics boxing smoke non smoke. Added new icons that you can use to create your own activity event for your personal energy level no energy low mid high . Searching for icons or activities events will now also include the category name. This can speed up your activity event selection when you create a new diary entry. Completely revised the app s introduction and tutorials. Fixed bugs: Changes in the notes field will now always save. Fixed a problem where under certain conditions the deletion of an entry would close the app. Fine tuned the layout here and there throughout the app. Rephrased some texts to be more descriptive. Last but not least we ve added a link to our blog in Menu Settings About . We are very excited about this update and hope that you like the changes as much as we do! : Your feedback is incredibly important to us so do not hesitate and let us know what you think about it.

Thanks to you we are going in the right direction of making Moodistory better every day! And starting today Moodistory has more insights for you! We ve now added a new chart in the analysis area that nicely shows the trend of your average mood per day. This doesn t just look beautiful it also lets you easily identify mood swings. You can find the new chart right in the analysis area below your average mood. Since we were already improving our mood charts we found it useful to also add a new time range The last 7 days for the analysis area. Please let us know if this fits your needs! We also got the feedback from you that you want to have something like often used events when creating an entry. This feature is actually available for a long time but it is a bit hidden. That s why we ve added a hint that shows you where to find it: Whenever you come to the events selection screen just tap on any headline Drinks Food etc. and select Recent . There you have it your recently used events. : Last but not least we fixed a few bugs and tweaked Moodistory a little. We hope you like the new version!

You can store you videos in the cloud, on your phone or share them with your friends!

KEEP A PERSONAL JOURNAL
Every journal entry automatically defaults to private. We also give you the enhanced option of sharing specific entries with some or all of the friends you may choose to add to your inner circle.

EASILY LOOK BACK THROUGH YOUR POSTS
Ever tried to find a photo stored in your phone, only to have to scroll through hundreds – or thousands – of other photos or videos first? When you post to My Life Journal, you’ll be able to search through your previous posts using keywords and tags, making it super quick and easy to find specific photos, videos, audio files and journal entries.

SHARE MOMENTS WITH YOUR INNER CIRCLE
Sometimes we don’t want to share content with the world on social media and we’d rather share it with those closest to us. With My Life Journal, it’s easy to keep your photos, videos and posts between you and your closest friends, family or group. We help you stay connected with those closest to you without all of the distraction.

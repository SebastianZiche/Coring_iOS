App Promotional Text
Make your mental health a priority by diving into the world of affirmations.
App Description
Our brains are wired to repeat negative feelings if fed with negative thoughts. Luckily the same goes for the positive side. Daily affirmations help us rewire our brains and fix these negative patterns.


“If you practice saying positive things in non-stressful situations, it has been found that you can change your brain’s reactions” - Caroline Miller

Affirmations are simple yet powerful statements that help us validate our core values. The latest researches indicate that practicing positive mantras and daily affirmations decreases stress, improves performance on challenging duties, builds self-esteem, and overall, makes us happier. As a result; we feel better, make healthier decisions, and live a happier life. Now, unleash your subconscious mind’s power and take your first step in the world of affirmations with Mantra.

All the affirmations inside our app are constantly updated. Instructions are clear: Think positive and hold down the button! Your affirmation will glow and you will light up! Give it a try and observe how you start your days in a better mood! Besides your daily affirmations, you can always read as many affirmations as you like by simply swiping.

Here is what you will get with our application:
• Affirmations for any situation from 30+ different categories and topics.
• More than a thousand "I am" affirmations
• Smart daytime and bedtime affirmation reminders (as push notifications)
• Uniquely new daily affirmations
• Practice as many affirmations as you want
• Create your own collections of affirmations

• Add your own affirmations if you can’t find what you’re looking for
• Record your voice and listen on repeat
• Manifestation sessions and guided affirmation sessions
• Personalize your theme with hundreds of cherry-picked background images, videos and fonts
• Ambient sounds that uplift you
• Share your daily affirmations to any platform in portrait or square mode

    Hello! We're so excited to announce our latest update for Mantra, which includes many new features and improvements. Here's what's new with Mantra:

    • Introducing Affirmation Sessions •
    We've created a series of guided affirmation sessions. Each session is centered around a specific topic and will guide you into the positive world of affirmations. Simply put on your headphones or earphones, make yourself comfortable, and start the session. You can either follow along with the affirmations on the screen or close your eyes and repeat them to yourself. You can track your progress for each session and experience the transformative power of affirmations on your journey towards becoming a calmer, more positive version of yourself.

    • Lock screen widgets •
    With the release of iOS 16, you can now receive affirmations at a glance on your iPhone lock screen. These new widgets will keep you positive in a convenient way. These widgets are not only functional, but also visually appealing.

    • Mantra Music •
    We know you love our background music tracks. Now we have created a dedicated section for music. You can choose to listen to our ambient sounds by setting a timer or you can dive into our music library and enjoy.

    • Breathwork •
    Whether you want to relax, concentrate, or sleep, we got you covered with amazing breathing techniques. You'll feel the immediate effects on your body and mind.

    • Articles •
    We've assembled a team of writers who are passionate about positivity and have experience with affirmations. We'll be regularly posting new blog posts full of positive affirmations and inspiration.

    • New themes •
    We've added a variety of new themes, which have been organized into categories such as Nature, Minimalistic, Live, and Colors to make them easier to browse.

    • New affirmations •
    We've added a selection of new affirmations to keep things fresh, and we're always working to improve and expand our content with each update.

    • Search •
    You can now search for affirmations, sessions, blogs, and music pieces within the app.


    —


    Besides these major changes, we have lots of minor improvements as well.

    • Analytics: You can now view your analytical stats in your profile, including the number of days you've read your daily affirmation, the number of sessions you've completed, and your current streak.

    • Reveal animation: You can now customize the affirmation revealing animation in the settings menu. This includes the option to disable the letter-by-letter revealing animation, which was requested by some of you.

    • Data control: You have the option to clear your history or delete your account, though we hope you'll continue using the app and benefiting from its positive affirmations.

    • Feedback form: You can suggest new content ideas, request features, or report bugs using the forms found in the settings menu.

    • This update also includes various bug fixes and performance improvements.

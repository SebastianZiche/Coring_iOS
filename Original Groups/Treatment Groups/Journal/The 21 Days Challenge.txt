App Description
Create your ideal life with life changing habits.
It is estimated that it takes people 21 days to form a new habit. So it’s a perfect amount of time to change or introduce something new in your life. Choose the best challenge for you and do it for 21 days and you’re going to see how the habit becomes part of your lifestyle day by day.

Starting a healthy lifestyle, taking a break away from the internet, practicing gratitude, trying to be more productive, simple practices to find happiness and calm in your life, how to study effectively for all the students, ways to spread kindness and positivity, tips for fixing your sleeping schedule and daily positive affirmations are some of the challenges that you can find in the app.

Once you complete your daily task, you can mark as completed and collect the points (to customize your avatar). This way, you can use this app like a habit tracker.

In the gratitude challenge, you can write your thoughts and share them in the feed (you can leave anonymously too). Here you're going to see all the community answers and you can also give it a like on your favorite ones.

Complete tasks on your profile and do daily challenges to collect points so you can buy items for your own avatar like different hairstyles, eyes and mouth shapes and clothes.
Create a healthier and happier mind with journaling. With this app you can daily journal and choose your daily mood. Then you can track your mood in the calendar and see all your previous records.
You also a have a selection of positive wallpapers for your phone.

Enable notifications and choose the time to be notified to remind you to do the challenge every day.

Don’t forget to take care of your body and mind. It's the only place you have to live.

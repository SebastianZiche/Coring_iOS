App Description
Record your precious day with a ghostdiary!
You can record your daily life easily and quickly with cute ghost characters.



"Emotional Records"
Record your mood as a ghost butler character, and check out the calendar at a glance.
It is also possible to classify the diary by each emotion.



"Daily Diary"
Record who you spent the day with and what you did with various icons.
Write it simply with icons on a daily basis, and on a special day, with pictures and long articles.



"Mood Tracker"
Check the statistics on emotions and activities recorded.
Identify the factors that affect my emotions.



"Memo"
Have you ever wanted to separate themes such as travel diary and cooking diary ?
Create a folder and record it one by one by one.
Or if you have to remember something,
but it's ambiguous to write in your diary, write it separately in the memo column.



"Fortune cookies."
Start your day with ghost cookies. There'll be a note in it that'll help.
When you have negative thoughts such as depression, insomnia, or irritation, stress
pull out a fortune cookie and control your mind.



"Design Theme"
Ghost Butler offers a variety of themed calendars. We are currently offering basic themes and summer themes.



"Diary with Password"
You can set a password to keep the record safe.



"Other Features"
It also provides functions such as notification function, font setting, and calendar image sharing.



"Contact Us"
Please let me know in the review! Thank you :)

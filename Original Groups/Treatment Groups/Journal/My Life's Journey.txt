App Description
My Life’s Journey is an app which encourages people to record things that matter most to them, and that shape who they are - as a way of preserving a sense of self and leaving a legacy once they are gone.

Its design is based on the use of Reminiscence Therapy - a psychosocial intervention that involves discussion of past events and experiences, using tangible prompts to evoke memories and stimulate conversation.

It is an app that can be used by every New Zealander to record their life’s journey for future generations.

It’s simple, intuitive design, and easy to follow categories, allow the user to tailor their story, in their own words. By downloading text, images and audio, people can fully build a picture of what and who matters most to them. Be that old family stories, favourite songs or even much loved family recipes. It is one central place to keep a bank of memories, just as you remember them.

The My Life’s Journey app has been produced with the support of the Ministry of Social Development, and Alzheimers New Zealand.

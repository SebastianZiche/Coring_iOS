App Description
Ahead - the app that teaches us what school didn’t: How to be in charge of our emotions!
Developed by learning behavior-change scientists

Do you sometimes regret having been so thin-skinned, worried, lazy, impulsive, shy, pessimistic, insensitive, people-pleasing…?
Imagine being like one of those rare people who’re always calm and kind, even under pressure…

We wanted that too. Because having emotional intelligence impacts our lives more than anything else: It makes us better partners, parents, friends, and colleagues - more connected, successful, and happy.
Luckily, we are behavior-change scientists - so we built Ahead to help us become the person we want to be. Thousands of calm and kind Ahead users are living proof of that!

Try it yourself! Learn to manage your emotions for 5 min a day. Your personalized journey will make you reach your goals in weeks!
Overcome unhelpful emotional thought patterns with simple, science-proven techniques
Find out what's driving your emotions and how to prevent outbursts through interactive reflections
Learn what works for you, then directly apply it (no “in one ear, out another”) in fun, short activities
Build your personal toolkit to manage emotions
Track emotional moments and see your progress
Learn together with like-minded people

At Ahead, every day is New Year’s day! So start investing in yourself now - and benefit forever. Your future self says thanks!

We promise to only give science-proven advice, never reveal your secrets, and always act in your favor. Let’s make the world a kinder place together!

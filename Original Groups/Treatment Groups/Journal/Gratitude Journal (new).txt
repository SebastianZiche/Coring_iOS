    The first Gratitude Journal that comes with FREE coaching! It's one thing to have a gratitude journal, it's another thing to actually know how to use it to create the life you want. That's why we are rolling out our new coaching features. The first phase will link you directly to our podcast so you can quickly and easily discover the topics that will benefit you the most.

    Is it ok if we overdeliver? In this release, we are connecting you with our latest gift, a new podcast called Radical Shift. During the past 10 years of Gratitude being on the App Store, many have reached out to me for advice. This forced me to dive deep into neuroscience, mindset, ancient wisdom and positive psychology and what I discovered is shocking. This is raw and honest truth designed to create a radical shift in your life in ways you never thought possible!

This upgrade is to improve the speed, scrolling issues and other small fixes! If you ever need any help, shoot us a message and we will get on it ASAP. Thanks so much for getting Gratitude and investing in your awesome self!

Version 1.8.7 (Jun 19, 2018)
    99 out of 99 doctors agree that writing in the Gratitude app before going to sleep is waaaaay better than checking Facebook or Instagram. OK, it was actually 100 doctors but one got upset with me when I pointed out that he was posting a selfie while we were talking and I said that it was ironic. But he said he needed to traffic and thought it wasn't funny or ironic, that I wasn't very funny or even knew what irony meant. I told him he was wrong and it was hilarious and we can just agree to disagree. Then he went and ruined my survey results. The jerk.
Version 1.8.6 (Jun 13, 2018)
    Gratitude was confused with it's error messages. But we sat down, had a little heart to heart, and now she is clear on what to tell you if you push her buttons. Much love to all of you!! Carla xo
Version 1.8.5 (Apr 30, 2018)

    A NOTE FROM CARLA:
    Your privacy is important to me, so I chose to fund Gratitude myself rather than sell your data in exchange for funding. Indie app producers like myself have been pushed out of the App Store by by companies with deep pockets. They create amazing apps and give them away in exchange for your data. I will never do that. I think it's important you know that you have options.

    Carla :)

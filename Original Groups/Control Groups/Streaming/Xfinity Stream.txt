Version 5.3.1 (Jan 9, 2019)
    We were having a problem with really large downloads that just didn’t finish downloading. Super frustrating, we know. We caught the little bugger causing the problem and sent him back to 2018. Buh-bye bug!
Version 5.3.0 (Dec 11, 2018)
    - We now support Siri Shortcuts, which are quick ways to get things done with a tap or by asking Siri. Run a shortcut by asking Siri to take you to your commonly watched content, like recordings or downloads. Add a shortcut anytime under Settings > Siri & Search.​

    - We took care of the layout issues that cropped up on the new iPad Pro so that shouldn’t be a problem any longer. Stream away! ​
Version 5.2.0 (Nov 15, 2018)

    - Faster, more responsive download messaging. We all know downloads can run into trouble. On the occasion where the download refuses to cooperate, we’ll let you know quickly so you’re not left hanging. You’ll also have the option of retrying or deleting the download from your collection. Because nobody likes an uncooperative download. ​
Version 5.1.2 (Nov 2, 2018)
    - We've made the big blue Watch button on show and movie screens predictive, smarter and a little magical. Now you can go right to the latest episode of a series, watch the live version even if it’s currently airing, or jump right back in where you left off. Same goes for movies!

    - We’ve also scared off some bugs that kept creeping around the mini player and cleaned up content screens for easier, faster navigation.
Version 5.1.1 (Oct 29, 2018)

    - Good news for multitaskers! Now you can minimize the playback screen to a mini-player, so no matter what device you're on, you can watch and browse at the same time.

    - In support of iOS 12, we’ve fixed some bugs to ensure the best experience possible.
Version 5.0.0 (Sep 6, 2018)
    · You’ve always used the Stream app to watch content available for purchase. Now we’re adding rentals to the mix. Watch your rentals when you’re away from home, or download them to watch offline.
    · You can now also use the app to discover content available to rent or buy. Browse through countless options and when you’re ready to watch, go online or use your TV Box to purchase or rent.
    · Not in the mood to buy or rent? We get it. So we’ve made it easier to find no-cost content. We’ve added “Free to Me” options to the Browse menu so you can see what’s available with your subscription.
Version 4.12.2 (Aug 23, 2018)
    Starting playback from the website could sometimes cause the app to get stuck in a loading state. We greased the wheels and playback started from the website should now work smoothly.
Version 4.12.1 (Aug 14, 2018)
    There's been an annoying bug crashing the playback experience for some of our users. We've found it and sent it packing. ​
Version 4.12.0 (Aug 7, 2018)
    TV lovers rejoice! New features to brighten your screens and your day.

    · Binge watching just got easier. When you’re watching a show, if the next episode is available to stream, we'll queue it up. Look mom, no hands! Just check the "Next Episode" button in the player or use the toggle in Settings.

    · The TV Series screens have been redesigned to make finding and watching your favorites even easier. Coming soon to a device near you!

    · Remember the annoying bug that caused closed captions to appear enabled when they weren’t actually turned on? Welp, we fixed it and a few others just for good measure.

    · Occasionally things go wrong, and we get how frustrating that can be. So, we’ve created better, more detailed error messaging so you’re not left wondering what happened. ​
Version 4.11.2 (Jul 16, 2018)
    More good news for Comcast Business customers. We’ve ironed out some wrinkles to ensure the best experience, no matter where you watch.
Version 4.11.1 (Jul 9, 2018)
    -Hello Comcast Business customers! Now small and mid-sized business customers can enjoy the Stream app. Simply tap the Comcast Business link to sign in and start watching live TV at work. This may or may not be a good thing for productivity.

    -Feast your eyes on fresh movie screens. Streamlined for better organization, we’ve tucked less popular actions into an overflow menu so that important things, like watching and downloading, are front and center. This mobile-friendly redesign offers faster, more consistent navigation so you’ll spend less time searching, and more time watching.
Version 4.10.3 (Jun 11, 2018)
    Good news for World Cup fans! In select local markets, FOX channels will now be available to watch live when you’re on the go, away from home. Look for the FOX TV Go channel in your Guide to find upcoming matches and, if you’re in one of these select markets, take the action with you! ​
Version 4.10.2 (May 24, 2018)
    What's New

    We’re working on our communication skills! With this release, we've improved our messaging to keep you up to date on app features and changes.
Version 4.10.1 (May 17, 2018)
    -Bug fixes.
Version 4.10.0 (May 3, 2018)
    -We've streamlined the layout of content rows which should make browsing and finding your favorite shows a bit easier.
    -Bug fixes.
Version 4.9.2 (Apr 12, 2018)
    Bug fixes and UI tweaks.
Version 4.9.1 (Mar 21, 2018)
    -Bugfixes and tweaks to the player controls and zoom gesture.
Version 4.9.0 (Mar 9, 2018)
    ·Player controls have been refreshed with a cleaner, more efficient display and we’ve swapped out the zoom feature with a pinch gesture that we hope is a bit more intuitive.
    ·Want to watch a program already in progress? If it’s available On Demand, you'll see a Restart button so you can watch from the beginning.
    ·Tap the forward and back arrows multiple times to get to the best parts even faster. Happy skipping!
    ·Dates and times will now be set and styled using your device's regional formatting settings. ​
Version 4.8.2 (Feb 14, 2018)
    · There was an issue resuming playback on downloaded recordings after locking/unlocking a device. Annoying, we agree. It’s fixed so now you can pick up exactly where you left off.
    · On Demand playback is running smoothly since we swept a few minor bugs from the time bar and skip forward/back controls.
Version 4.8.1 (Feb 5, 2018)
    - We’ve expanded the types of things you can search for. Now you can search by movie genre, sports type, or even Olympic teams and events. Find a collection of shows and movies to fit every mood.
Version 4.8.0 (Jan 16, 2018)
    ·If there’s a problem with video playback, we’ll automatically check to see if it’s available to watch On Demand instead.
    ·Create a big screen on your small screen. iPhone X users can use the new Zoom feature to fill the entire display.
    ·Using Parental Controls? Now the PIN prompt will display as soon as someone attempts to browse adult content. Plus, you can snooze the prompt for 1, 2, or 4 hours after a successful PIN entry.
    ·Glitch fix! Now all programs that are watched will appear marked as watched, so you can binge without backtracking.
    ·Improved error messaging for instances where content is unavailable.
Version 4.7.1 (Dec 8, 2017)
    -Optimized the height of the minimized player on iPhone X.
Version 4.7.0 (Nov 28, 2017)
    -iPhone X support.
    -More efficient image-handling throughout the app.
    -Deep link bug fixes.
    -Additional deep link support for special event menus and video playback.
    -Fixed an issue where, in certain cases, downloads returned from another device would still be downloaded to the original device.
Version 4.6.0 (Oct 20, 2017)
    Autumn is in the air, and with that comes a new version of iOS. We've updated and tuned our app for iOS 11 and squashed a handful of pesky bugs along the way:

    -Tired of the player controls showing up randomly during playback? We removed the ghost that was tapping the screen so your playback sessions should no longer be haunted.
    -We solved the mystery of the missing cover art and logos when playing downloads offline (no thanks to those meddling kids!).
    -Flickering channel logos when leaving and coming back to the grid are now a thing of the past. The grid now burns bright and steady, like a warm, glowing Jack o' Lantern.
Version 4.5.0 (Sep 5, 2017)
    Dots! On the grid! If you're a cloud DVR subscriber, you can now see that a show is set to record without having to expand each cell in the Live TV listings.

    - Did you set a recording on another device or your TV box and don't see it in the app? We're only refreshing the Scheduled and Recordings lists every few minutes, so waiting will do the trick -- but you can also force a refresh by pulling down on the list (just as you would in the Mail app).

    - Downloads are now automatically renewed for as long as they can be when you connect to the Internet. In practice, this means downloaded purchases can stay on your device indefinitely, recordings can stay until they're deleted from your Cloud DVR, and TV Go programs can stay until they expire as long as you connect to the Internet periodically.

    - Fixes for a few edge-case TV listings grid crashes, as well as some accessibility improvements around navigating the grid.
Version 4.4.0 (Aug 1, 2017)
    We've made some changes to the app's navigation and how we organize content to help you find interesting things to watch, faster. Check it out by tapping the hamburger button in the top left corner.

    - The two Popular rows in For You have been replaced by more timely and relevant content. You don't care that Mickey Mouse Club is popular if you're interested in the latest episode of Game of Thrones, and vice versa.

    - The Live section now offers quick access to your favorite channels as well as all the channels available out of home.

    - Kids, Sports, and Movies content--both live and On Demand--is highlighted in the new Browse section.

    We also fixed an issue where your resume point could be lost when moving from in-home viewing to out-of-home viewing. (We automatically pivot you to eqivalent TV Go content if possible when you move off your home WiFi, and this would often result in a show restarting from the beginning rather than where you were when the network change occurred. We err on the side of going back a bit to avoid spoilers, but we shouldn't go all the way back to the beginning.)
Version 4.3.1 (Jul 6, 2017)
    This release contains a change to make the SAP button in the player active whenever an additional audio track is present.
Version 4.3.0 (Jun 12, 2017)
    - We heard you loud and clear: You want a way to get back to your favorite shows quickly without having to search. Now you can, with the new Favorites section. If you have an X1 set-top box and have favorited shows there, you'll see those on your phone or tablet as well. To add favorites, visit the Info screen for any show or team and tap Add to Favorites.

    - We finally managed to kill one of our top crashes -- deleting a recording from the Just Recorded row on For You -> BOOM -- as well as a few others in that same area.

    - For MLB Extra Innings subscribers, if the game you want to see is blacked out, we now give you the option of checking for a local listing when you get the blackout message.
Version 4.2.1 (May 9, 2017)
    This update brings a few bug fixes, including one to make the Channel Finder easier to navigate with VoiceOver on.
Version 4.2.0 (May 2, 2017)
    - Big news for MLB Extra Innings subscribers: You can now watch every out-of-market game in HD in any room in your house! There's a channel for every team, so you'll get to hear your favorite announcers call the game. (Games are subject to local blackout restrictions; when a blackout occurs, check for the game on a local channel.) MLB Extra Innings subscribers can find these HD channels just above the TV Go channels, or search for MLB in the channel finder at the top of the All Listings screen.

    - The tiles in the Recent Channels row on the For You screen now go directly to video when tapped instead of expanding. (Yay!) We also fixed the issue where Voice Over wasn't reading the program title below the tile, so VO users will now hear what's airing on the channel before making the leap.

    - We finally admitted to ourselves that cover art isn't well suited to the Apple Watch and removed it. Without images clogging up the pipes, changing STBs now works again, and the Watch app should feel snappier overall.

    - Last but not least, we're springing an experimental feature on you: Background Audio. It's off by default, but faithful release note readers can turn it on by going to app settings and toggling Allow Background Audio. Please let us know how it works for you!
Version 4.1.0 (Mar 23, 2017)
    - We're now automatically selecting the best available option to watch a channel or program: HD if available, TV Go content when you're out of home, and so on. (If you really miss the huge list of Watch Options we used to show in the program screens, you can disable this feature in Settings.)

    - After a few attempts at making the All Listings grid more accessible to VoiceOver users, we've settled on diving into the details screen when VoiceOver is enabled rather than expanding the cells. Please let us know how this works for you, VoiceOver users!
Version 4.0.1 (Mar 2, 2017)
    A fix for an embarrassing visual bug. Nothing to see here! :-o
Version 4.0.0 (Feb 28, 2017)
    Welcome to the XFINITY Stream app. We changed our look to improve your entertainment experience.
    - Updated app icon. Check.
    - Snazzy new name. Check.
    - More to stream on any screen. Check, check, check!
Version 3.12.0 (Feb 13, 2017)
    - Favorite Channels have arrived! If you already have favorites set up on your X1 set-top box or in the TV Remote app, you'll see those channels marked with a star in the All Listings grid. You can add or remove favorites in All Listings, of course, but also in the Channel Finder and in Search. To see only your favorites, filter by Favorite Channels. Voilá!
    - Search has moved out of the left navigation bar and up to the top right corner of the screen, where you were looking for it all along.
    - More accessibility fixes, including better support for large fonts.
Version 3.11.0 (Dec 20, 2016)
    - We re-wrote our Live TV listings grid to be faster and more reliable, and at the same time we tackled some of the bigger accessibility challenges, such as navigating the channels and the time-based listings and interacting with individual program details when using VoiceOver or switch devices.

    - The player controls no longer dismiss automatically when using VoiceOver or switch devices; there's now a button available to dismiss them when you're ready. This should make it possible to hear all the control options as well as lengthy program descriptions.

    - Common Sense Media ratings are now displayed throughout the app to help you make more informed viewing choices.

    - In certain instances, the minibar would not display the most recent resume point. This has been fixed.

    - Removed a distracting animation on the Recordings screen that happened every time that screen was opened.
Version 3.10.0 (Nov 29, 2016)
    - We now show--and enable--the Closed Captioning (CC) button in the player if the video stream indicates captions are available, even if the program details say they aren't. No more getting stuck with captions on when you want them off, or off when you want them on.
    - Player controls stay up longer before dismissing when VoiceOver or a switch device is in use to give users a chance to read the entire program description.
Version 3.9.2 (Nov 7, 2016)
    - Finally got a fix for ad breaks looping and preventing you from getting to the end of your show.
    - Updates to the Date Picker in the All Listings guide to make finding TV listings by date and time a bit easier.
    - Fixes to make the app more resilient to missing data and multiple filters (aka fewer crashes!)
Version 3.9.1 (Oct 13, 2016)
    - A fix for slow video startup on iOS 10 devices.
    - A Channel Finder that's actually accessible. We want that feature to help all users find the channel they want to watch; now it can.
    - Similarly, it's now possible to navigate to the channel keypad in the video player with VoiceOver.
    - Fixed a crash that could occur after changing the SafeBrowse setting in Settings > Parental Controls.
Version 3.9.0 (Sep 21, 2016)
    We've got a bunch of improvements for you in this release -- and one significant name change.

    - A server error we weren't handling properly is causing many of you to incorrectly receive 403 errors. We're handling the error in this release, so you should be able to carry on as usual now. Sorry about that!
    - The section formerly known as Guide is now Live TV.
    - You can now filter Live TV listings by DVS (descriptive video) availability.
    - Don't care what movies are popular, just which ones are good? Try sorting On Demand > Movies galleries by Rotten Tomatoes Critic or Audience score.
    - Did you know you could delete an entire recording group (or a single recording) by swiping from right to left? Now you can *also* delete multiple recordings--all of them or just a few--by entering Edit mode inside a recording group.
    - Our For You and Kids, Sports, and Movies Live TV sections have been less than accessible, and it really bugged us. We've given the carousels in these sections a complete overhaul with accessibility in mind in this release. We also fixed a few accessibility issues in our player controls and in Settings > Parental Controls.
    - Tired of scrolling through hundreds of channels to find the one you want? Now you can find channels by number or by name, and either tune directly or jump to that channel in the grid to see what's on. Just tap the Find button in Live TV > All Listings.
    - Wondering how long your downloads will last? We've got you covered. You can now clearly see how much viewing time you have left on your downloads, so you can prioritize which shows to watch first.
Version 3.8.1 (Aug 8, 2016)
    - Team images now load properly on iPad (e.g., if you search for the Philadelphia Phillies and go to the team's entity page, you should see the Phillies logo on the baseball field background now instead of an empty field).
    - Olympic team images are no longer overlaid with redundant gray text.
Version 3.8.0 (Jul 29, 2016)
    - To help you quickly get to the program you want to see no matter what network you're on, Watch buttons for programs on in-home only channels are now always enabled if there's an equivalent TV Go channel available. Go watch that show! We won't stop you.
    - A few labels and messages that still showed in English when the device language was set to Spanish now appear properly in Spanish.
    - We also fixed several bugs, including two crashes standing between you and your Purchases.
Version 3.7.0 (Jul 6, 2016)
    - In limited markets, live local broadcast channels NBC and ABC can now be streamed when you're on the go.
    - ¿Hablas español? If your device language is set to Español, the app UI will be now, too. ¡Vamos a ver televisión!
    - Have you ever gotten on a plane only to find all the shows you downloaded have disappeared? We are REALLY sorry about that; the bug that caused that behavior should be fixed now.
    - Fixed a few more Voice Over bugs in our ongoing effort to improve accessibility, including accurately reading download progress, announcing the Info button for future airings in the Kids/Sports/Movies guide areas, and prompting for a PIN when attempting to parentally lock a network.
Version 3.6.0 (Jun 2, 2016)
    Now you can manage all the streaming and download devices associated with your account from inside the app. Lost a device? No problem—you can remove it from your account, return any downloads, and free up a device slot from Settings > Manage Devices.
Version 3.5.1 (May 18, 2016)
    - Fixed the way we keep track of which emergency alerts you've seen, so you don't have to watch the same one again when you switch to a different show.
    - Fixed a crash that could occur if you had recorded a TV series without episodes (e.g., a news show) and paired an Apple Watch with your iPhone.
Version 3.5.0 (May 4, 2016)
    - Video playback when you want it (and ONLY when you want it). You can now dismiss the player—and quickly return to it at any time via a snazzy minibar at the bottom of the screen.
    - On Demand enhancements. More categories, more suggestions, more help finding great content to watch.
    - Purchases in your pocket. If you've purchased On Demand content, you can now stream and download it without leaving the app.
    - In limited markets, live local broadcast channels NBC and ABC can now be streamed when you're on the go.
    - We've updated our Watch app for watchOS 2. You may need to toggle the Show App on Apple Watch switch to get the latest & greatest.
    - Lots of bug fixes, including the one that caused in-progress recordings of lengthy programs to freeze. Sporting event recorders rejoice!
Version 3.2.0 (Mar 9, 2016)
    * Improved first-time user login flow
    * A lovely new left menu
    * 3D touch quick actions that let you launch into All Listings, Recordings, and On Demand Movies and TV Shows on iPhone 6s and 6s Plus

Version 3.1.0 (Jan 12, 2016)
    - Support for Xfinity On Campus users.
    - Bug fixes! (We finally got that one where the logos in the Guide would occasionally disappear, making it look wonky, plus a few others.)
Version 3.0.0 (Dec 15, 2015)
    - An updated For You screen that includes popular On Demand titles and recently-tuned channels to help you find something to watch faster
    - Easier-to-tap player controls, as well as gestures for skipping 15 seconds while watching recordings and On Demand (double-tap on the left to skip back, and on the right to skip forward)
    - Multitasking support on iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, and iPad Pro, as well as Picture-in-Picture video
    - Bug fixes (of course!)
Version 2.5.0 (Oct 27, 2015)
    We've added TV Go channels to the Guide so you can watch live TV anywhere you go.

    IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADS, please note that you will need to go online after updating to 2.5.0 in order to refresh your licenses. The process only takes a minute or two, and then you can watch your downloads offline as usual.

    Additional changes in this release include:
    - Filter the Guide by TV Go to find channels to watch when you're not at home.
    - Filter On Demand by SAP to find programs with secondary audio tracks.
    - Filters are now sticky across the Guide and On Demand.
    - Live TV no longer auto-plays. Choose whether to play the channel you were last watching, or browse for something new.
    - "In Home" and "TV Go" badges help differentiate which content can be watched where.
    - The video player will pivot you to watchable content when you're not at home.
    - Additional options added to Help, including one for Feedback. We'd love to hear your thoughts on the app.
    - Minor bug fixes for iOS 9 users. (Goodbye, overlapping login fields!)

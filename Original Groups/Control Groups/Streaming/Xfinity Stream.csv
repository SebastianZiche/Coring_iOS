We ve updated and tuned our app for iOS 11 and squashed a handful of pesky bugs along the way: Tired of the player controls showing up randomly during playback We removed the ghost that was tapping the screen so your playback sessions should no longer be haunted. We solved the mystery of the missing cover art and logos when playing downloads offline no thanks to those meddling kids! . Flickering channel logos when leaving and coming back to the grid are now a thing of the past. The grid now burns bright and steady like a warm glowing Jack o Lantern.
731629156,1000600000452717,Xfinity Stream,Entertainment,,2013-12-04,93.26,3,1,0,0,4.5.0,2017-09-05,Dots! On the grid! If you re a cloud DVR subscriber you can now see that a show is set to record without having to expand each cell in the Live TV listings. Did you set a recording on another device or your TV box and don t see it in the app We re only refreshing the Scheduled and Recordings lists every few minutes so waiting will do the trick but you can also force a refresh by pulling down on the list just as you would in the Mail app . Downloads are now automatically renewed for as long as they can be when you connect to the Internet. In practice this means downloaded purchases can stay on your device indefinitely recordings can stay until they re deleted from your Cloud DVR and TV Go programs can stay until they expire as long as you connect to the Internet periodically. Fixes for a few edge case TV listings grid crashes as well as some accessibility improvements around navigating the grid.
731629156,1000600000452717,Xfinity Stream,Entertainment,,2013-12-04,93.26,3,1,0,0,4.4.0,2017-08-01,We ve made some changes to the app s navigation and how we organize content to help you find interesting things to watch faster. Check it out by tapping the hamburger button in the top left corner. The two Popular rows in For You have been replaced by more timely and relevant content. You don t care that Mickey Mouse Club is popular if you re interested in the latest episode of Game of Thrones and vice versa. The Live section now offers quick access to your favorite channels as well as all the channels available out of home. Kids Sports and Movies content both live and On Demand is highlighted in the new Browse section. We also fixed an issue where your resume point could be lost when moving from in home viewing to out of home viewing. We automatically pivot you to eqivalent TV Go content if possible when you move off your home WiFi and this would often result in a show restarting from the beginning rather than where you were when the network change occurred. We err on the side of going back a bit to avoid spoilers but we shouldn t go all the way back to the beginning.
731629156,1000600000452717,Xfinity Stream,Entertainment,,2013-12-04,93.26,3,1,0,0,4.3.1,2017-07-06,This release contains a change to make the SAP button in the player active whenever an additional audio track is present.

Now you can with the new Favorites section. If you have an X1 set top box and have favorited shows there you ll see those on your phone or tablet as well. To add favorites visit the Info screen for any show or team and tap Add to Favorites. We finally managed to kill one of our top crashes deleting a recording from the Just Recorded row on For You BOOM as well as a few others in that same area. For MLB Extra Innings subscribers if the game you want to see is blacked out we now give you the option of checking for a local listing when you get the blackout message.
731629156,1000600000452717,Xfinity Stream,Entertainment,,2013-12-04,93.26,3,1,0,0,4.2.1,2017-05-09,This update brings a few bug fixes including one to make the Channel Finder easier to navigate with VoiceOver on.

There s a channel for every team so you ll get to hear your favorite announcers call the game. Games are subject to local blackout restrictions when a blackout occurs check for the game on a local channel. MLB Extra Innings subscribers can find these HD channels just above the TV Go channels or search for MLB in the channel finder at the top of the All Listings screen. The tiles in the Recent Channels row on the For You screen now go directly to video when tapped instead of expanding. Yay! We also fixed the issue where Voice Over wasn t reading the program title below the tile so VO users will now hear what s airing on the channel before making the leap. We finally admitted to ourselves that cover art isn t well suited to the Apple Watch and removed it. Without images clogging up the pipes changing STBs now works again and the Watch app should feel snappier overall. Last but not least we re springing an experimental feature on you: Background Audio. It s off by default but faithful release note readers can turn it on by going to app settings and toggling Allow Background Audio. Please let us know how it works for you!

If you really miss the huge list of Watch Options we used to show in the program screens you can disable this feature in Settings. After a few attempts at making the All Listings grid more accessible to VoiceOver users we ve settled on diving into the details screen when VoiceOver is enabled rather than expanding the cells. Please let us know how this works for you VoiceOver users!

The player controls no longer dismiss automatically when using VoiceOver or switch devices there s now a button available to dismiss them when you re ready. This should make it possible to hear all the control options as well as lengthy program descriptions. Common Sense Media ratings are now displayed throughout the app to help you make more informed viewing choices. In certain instances the minibar would not display the most recent resume point. This has been fixed. Removed a distracting animation on the Recordings screen that happened every time that screen was opened.

A server error we weren t handling properly is causing many of you to incorrectly receive 403 errors. We re handling the error in this release so you should be able to carry on as usual now. Sorry about that! The section formerly known as Guide is now Live TV. You can now filter Live TV listings by DVS descriptive video availability. Don t care what movies are popular just which ones are good Try sorting On Demand Movies galleries by Rotten Tomatoes Critic or Audience score. Did you know you could delete an entire recording group or a single recording by swiping from right to left Now you can also delete multiple recordings all of them or just a few by entering Edit mode inside a recording group. Our For You and Kids Sports and Movies Live TV sections have been less than accessible and it really bugged us. We ve given the carousels in these sections a complete overhaul with accessibility in mind in this release. We also fixed a few accessibility issues in our player controls and in Settings Parental Controls. Tired of scrolling through hundreds of channels to find the one you want Now you can find channels by number or by name and either tune directly or jump to that channel in the grid to see what s on. Just tap the Find button in Live TV All Listings. Wondering how long your downloads will last We ve got you covered. You can now clearly see how much viewing time you have left on your downloads so you can prioritize which shows to watch first.

Fixed a few more Voice Over bugs in our ongoing effort to improve accessibility including accurately reading download progress announcing the Info button for future airings in the Kids Sports Movies guide areas and prompting for a PIN when attempting to parentally lock a network.

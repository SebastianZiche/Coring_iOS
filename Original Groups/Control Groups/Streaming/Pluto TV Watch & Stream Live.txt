Version 4.1.7 (Oct 25, 2017)
    *Expanded On-Demand Movies Selection
    *Improved Perfomance
Version 4.0.9 (Oct 2, 2017)
    - Expanded Titles in Free Movies & TV Shows
    - Bug Fixes
Version 4.0.8 (Sep 17, 2017)
    * If you’re having binge watching problems, we feel bad for you son. We have 99 episodes of ALF and you don’t have to pay for any of them.
    * Yes, we added support for full TV Series On Demand. Now you can watch Thousands of your favorite shows and navigate easily between seasons.
    * We also added support for iOS 11 because it would be pretty silly if we didn’t.
    * We also fixed like 4 little bugs that our QA guy Arvin found. Email his boss Mary@pluto.tv if you find anymore bugs or if you just want to talk about stuff.
Version 4.0.7 (Aug 24, 2017)
    *We added support to increase our Free On Demand Movies catalog. Now there are more movies to choose from.
    *We also fixed an issue where longer movie titles were getting cut off.
Version 4.0.5 (Aug 16, 2017)
    *We made it easier to hide the channels you don’t want to watch. We get it...maybe the Horror 24/7 channel is just too scary or the Food TV channel makes you sooo hungry that you’re not sticking with your diet. Whatever the case, inside the My Pluto tab there is a 1 click tap to hide those channels from showing up on the guide.

    **We also made a few bug fixes. Yes that’s a pretty vague description, but it’s fairly boring stuff for 99% of you reading this. For example, one of the APIs was taking a few milliseconds too long to fire and there was a very rare case where iPad users would see their app crash if they ferociously switched back and forth between portrait and landscape modes like a crazy person.
Version 4.0.4 (Aug 10, 2017)
    *Are you sitting in bed with your iPad and just can’t muster enough energy to turn your screen sideways? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Just tap on the guide button to bring up all 100+ channels to see what’s on.
    **Still nothing that tickles your fancy after scrolling through every channel? Really? We’ll you better check out the New On Demand section. We’ve completely updated the movies and made it easier to find the top hits.
    ***Did the last build make your app crash after opening a push notification? Yes, that was terrible and we sent that engineer to detention. Our new engineer fixed the issues, and she promises this build won’t do that anymore.
Version 4.0.3 (Jul 29, 2017)
    - New Guide, More Channels, and Next Level Performance...We took this baby down to the studs. Speaking of amazing remodels, you’ll notice we added Frontdoor (CH 615) a DIY channel with series from HGTV.
    - On Demand you say? Free on demand? Your wish is our command. Watch thousands of hit movies and binge-worthy TV shows whenever and wherever you want. When your selection is over - switch back to live TV to see what’s on.
    - This new version clearly answers a burning question from all of our users, “do you really have live sports, breaking news, hit movie channels, music, cartoons, and crazy eccentric channels like The High Channel (cough*) and Anime (we’re nerds too)?". Yes, the answer is YES.
    - Have more questions about our Pluto TV’s 100+ live channels or 1000’s of movies and TV shows on demand? Contact our office mom, mary@pluto.tv and she will fix you right up.
    - Also, and I promise this is the last point, we need your help! Tell us what movies, TV shows or internet series you want us to add to Pluto TV. Mary@pluto.tv also handles those requests.
    - Okay...one more but this is a pro-tip not a point. If you access the ‘My Pluto’ section and customize your guide so only the cool channels show up...you may or may not improve your television watching experience. That’s really up to you!

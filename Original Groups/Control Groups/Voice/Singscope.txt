Our "Sheet Music Support Pack" can further help you with singing practices and warm-up. See details inside the app.
App Description
Singscope is a tool for checking the pitch of your singing. It analyzes the singing voice and shows the pitch in the music scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) as function of time. You can visualize your pitch and singing features, such as vibrato, in the scope.

Simply tap on the microphone button and sing to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, and watch the pitch curve showing in the scope as you sing.

Features:
- Computes and draws pitch graphs in real-time
- Supports pan and zoom for the pitch graph and waveform display
- Supports playback of singing voices on the pitch graph
- Keeps recent singing voices for reviewing later
- Optimized for 64-bit CPU, for faster pitch analysis and smoother graph display

Please note that there are limitations in this app. It can not handle more than one singing voice or polyphony. It may not recognize voices for certain singing styles. For more information, please visit us at www.singscope.com.

Inside the app, we offer an In-App Purchases item "Sheet Music Support Pack". It is a feature pack that adds sheet music functionality to Singscope:
- Include a set of sheet music for vocal warm-up exercises
- Support importing of a subset of MusicXML lead sheet files
- Play back musical notes in sheet music while recording your singing voice
- Can set tempo (bpm) and do music transposition on the lead sheets.
- Highlight the positions of the musical notes in your pitch graph

For more information about "Sheet Music Support Pack", please download this free app and see the introduction in the app.

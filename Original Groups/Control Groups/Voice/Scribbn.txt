App Promotional Text
Convert voice messages from iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Threema and co. to text. See emotions and key phrases at a glance to find out what it is about.
App Description
Have you ever been receiving voice messages and not being able to listen to it in peace? Scribbn wants to solve exactly this problem and convert what is spoken into written text. Convert your voice notes to text and don’t make your friends wait a long time for an answer. Perfect in situations where putting your phone to your ear is not an option such as at meetings, theaters, events etc. No headphones at hand? No problem! Simply scan information with your eyes at a pace faster than the sender’s um’s and uh’s.

Scribbn’s sophisticated AI can also create a summary so that you can quickly find out what that voice message is about before investing time reading the whole thing. The text summarizer will extract the key sentences. In addition Scribbn extracts emotions and key phrases which helps you getting a better picture of what’s going on.

After processing is finished the audio recording is not stored remotely with respect to your privacy. You can also easily search to find a specific voice message with some typing, meaning that you will never have to scroll through your conversations for hours again.

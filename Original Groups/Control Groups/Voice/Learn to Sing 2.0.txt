App Description
Program to help your singing voice! You will learn how to sing with several exercises! The app tells you how you should sing indicating the correct note, and shows your score according to right pitch. An intuitive way to learn music without knowing sheet music, but very useful even for professional singers.

You will learn all the musical notes, intervals and much more in a very easy and fun way.

Great for anyone who wants to improve the singing in karaoke, singing with friends, singing with a guitar or other instrument. Vocal warm up.

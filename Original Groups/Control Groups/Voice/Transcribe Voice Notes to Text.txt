App Description
Meet your new personal Transcriber app, crafted to transcribe your voice notes into text. Transcriber saves you precious time by transcribing your audio in mere minutes. Whether it’s interviews, lectures, meetings, or simply your quick speech notes, Transcriber can do it all.

Record your audio directly in the app, or import an already existing file and let Transcriber do the job, while you work on what is really important.

Save yourself some time and money. Thanks to the latest AI technology we will deliver a quick, cheap and precise transcription of your audio files in a few taps, while providing you with maximum privacy.


TOP FEATURES:

SAFE AND HIGH-QUALITY TRANSCRIPTION
Transcriptions are powered by advanced AI engines, which make the process quick, safe, and accurate.

RECORD OR IMPORT AUDIO & VIDEO
Start recording inside the app, or import audio or video you already have on your device or in your favorite app.

MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND ACCENTS ARE SUPPORTED
You can select not just from many languages, but also from different accents.

SPEAKER RECOGNITION
If there is more than one speaker, the Transcriber always knows who is speaking and marks speakers in the transcript accordingly.

STATUS LABELS
Have an overview of the state of your transcription. Once the process is done, we'll notify you.

TEXT EDITOR
Finalize the transcript in the editor to your liking. You can rename the speakers, adjust text size, fix any potential misspellings, and more.

EXPORT TRANSCRIPT
When your transcript is ready to be shared, easily export it in a PDF, TXT, or DOCX format to any popular app, such as OneDrive, MS Word, Dropbox, Google Drive, Mail, Slack, Skype, Signal, MS Teams, and many more.

NO ADS
No one likes ads, and we are no exception.


SUBSCRIPTION:

We offer clear subscription options. With our four plans – 30-minute, 2-hour, 5-hour, and 45-hour, you only pay for as many minutes as you need.

All plans cover all transcriber features + additional transcription time.


If you choose to get one of our plans, your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The cost of the renewal depends on your Subscription Plan. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. When canceling a subscription, your subscription will remain active until the end of the period. Auto-renewal will be disabled, but the current subscription will not be refunded.

App Description
A handy tool for classes, meetings, interviews or the everyday moments that’s worth savoring. Yating understands Mandarin, Mandarin-English code-switch and Taiwanese. Better yet, our translation and speech recognition languages are expanding. Let Yating handles the repetitive recording and transcribing work for you, so that you could focus on the important goals.

* 100% Made in Taiwan
The first speech recognition AI model that’s developed for Taiwanese accent Mandarin. We are 100% privately funded; the data and the RD are all from Taiwan.

* Small But Mighty
A handy tool for classes, meetings, interviews or the everyday moments that’s worth savoring. Yating understands Mandarin, English, Japanese, Cantonese and Taiwanese. Let Yating transcribes for you, so that you could focus on the important goals. You talk, Yating types.

*Talk Away, No Eavesdropping
We take your privacy seriously. We are not in the data selling business; your data is confidential and will not be transferred to any third parties. Your data is safe with us. You can execute the right to be forgotten by deleting your data from your account.

*Seamless Cross-Platform Experience
The service is available on Notebook and mobile, so that you can access Yating regardless you are in the office or on the go. Use the Yating app to record an interview, a meeting or a class. Turn on the Chrome Plug-in while you are in a Google Meet remote meeting, seminar or online course. If the internet is not stable, you can also record a voice memo and upload the audio file to convert to transcription later.

*Subtitle mode
We offer live transcription in the subtitle mode. A visual aid to help you better understand what's been said when you can't hear clearly, e.g. online classes, remote meetings or seminars. The feature also helps deaf users to enjoy every moments in life, real-time.

*Enterprise Solutions
For large organizations that need additional security, control and customised solutions for specific domains or industries, please feel free to contact us.

============= Many uses of Yating ===========

* Students
Use Yating to record lectures to help you review. Even when you accidentally doze out or lost focus during the class, you still have a chance to catch up and stay on track.

*Analysts & Data scientists
Are you doing Social Media Analytic or Sentiment analysis for specific brands or medias? In addition to written text, are you also interested in knowing what’s been discussed verbally? Yating offers API for you to batch convert audios and videos to text (.txt), so that your analysis is more comprehensive and covers more dimensions.

*UI/UX qualitative user researcher
Do you need to conduct qualitative research, i.e. in depth interviews or focus groups? Do you need to build user persona? Yating record the conversations in the transcription form— each verbose is labeled with the speaker plus time stamps. You can see who said what at what time-stamp in a glance. Yating saved 80% of the dictating time. Let Yating handles the repetitive transcribing work for you, so that you could focus on organizing the Affinity graph and extracting the crucial consumer insights.

*Podcaster
Are you producing a podcast program? Can your audience find a section of their favorite episodes easily? Yating converts conversations into text and present it in the transcription form. Adding a transcription for your program helps it to be more searchable— both for your audience and for the search engines!

*Hearing impaired
Are you losing hearing? Are you depending on lip-reading to understand what has been said? Yating offers live transcribe subtitle mode. When you have problems to hear clearly, turn on Yating’s subtitle mode, so that you could use textual assisting tool to help you understand what’s going on around you — what has been announced through the broadcast, what the online course or the panel talk is about, or what caused a heated debate in a remote meeting.

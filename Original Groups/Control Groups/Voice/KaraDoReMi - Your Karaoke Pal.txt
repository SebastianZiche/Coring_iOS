App Description
KaraDoReMi is an innovative song learning and karaoke mobile application using YouTube. Bring amazing song learning and karaoke experiences to users.

Innovative features include:
1. Using YouTube video to learn songs and singing performance including pitch and singing skills such as portamento and vibrato can be evaluated in real time
2. Song learning by song structure: We analyze songs and present to you their structures such as verse, chorus, etc. to help you understand the constitution of a song. Learning by song structure makes you learning to sing a song more quickly and easily. You can also learn to sing only those structures that you are not good at repeatedly
3. In-depth singing performance analysis: Our unique and powerful scoring engine can accurately evaluate your singing performance. Our powerful singing analysis function combines line chart of scores by each line of song lyrics and graph of your vocal pitch and original singer's vocal pitch to help you quickly pinpoint your weakness of singing. And then you can practice those lines of song lyrics repeatedly by singing along with YouTube video

Other key features include:
1. Global single song leaderboard: upload your proud recordings and show up your learning and singing results to the world
2. My Songbook: create your own songbooks. You can quickly pick one of your songbooks that best fits your mood, place, and special days to learn or sing
3. Editor's Choice: No idea what to sing? Our editors prepare various kinds of song lists such as Hot Songs From Tik Tok, Hits of the World, J-pop, K-pop, etc. to help you find songs to learn and sing

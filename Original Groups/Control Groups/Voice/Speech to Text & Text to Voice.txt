App Description
Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology.



With a click of a button or the touch of a finger, TTS can take words on a computer or other digital device and convert them into audio. TTS is very helpful for people who struggle with reading. But it can also help persons with writing and editing, and even focusing or people who have speech problems.



How Text-to-Speech Works



TTS works with nearly every personal digital device, including computers, smartphones and tablets. All kinds of text files can be read aloud, including Word and Pages documents.



The voice in TTS is computer-generated, and reading speed can usually be speed up or slowed down. Voice quality varies, but some voices sound human.



What is Speech to Text Software?



Speech to text software bills itself as the catch-all solution to transcription services — delivering the easy, accurate and fast transcript that you’ve been searching for. But, is it as good as the hype? What is ‘speech to text’ software anyway?



In a nutshell, speech to text software, or automatic speech recognition (ASR) software, or voice to text software, is a computer program that uses linguistic algorithms to sort auditory signals and transform that information into words using Unicode characters. Yikes!



Put more simply, speech to text software ‘listens’ to audio and delivers an editable, verbatim transcript.



With this application you will be able to do all of the above mentioned, both convert text to speech and speech to text with just a few steps, it is designed in a simple way so that everyone can use it as quickly as possible, especially people with hearing or speech problems.

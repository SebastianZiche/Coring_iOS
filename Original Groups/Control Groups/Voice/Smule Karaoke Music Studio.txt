Version 4.6.1 (Apr 19, 2016)
    Hello Sing!ers, Spring is here and so is a fresh new look and feel for the Sing! app. You'll find lots of improvements, big and small, throughout the app.

    + New font face, Proxima Nova, which improves legibility and readability on all devices.
    + Unified the style and color palette of all the icons and buttons. We like colors too, but there were way too many different colored buttons before causing confusion, even with ourselves!
    + Fixed the banners that appear on the songbook for iPhone 6 and bigger devices so it can actually fit in the bigger screen.
    + Video indicator is now vertical strips instead of horizontal, for the people that still know what a film reel looks like. Yah, we're with you.
    + No more swiping left to love blindly without listening. 'Nuff said.
    + Previously listens were being undercounted, so that's now fixed and you may see your listen counts go up. That's a good thing!
    + Cleaned up lots of crufty code, you don't want to know too much about this, except that it's always a good thing and makes our engineers happy to clean up code.
    + This update is more than a fresh new look. Read more about it at http://blog.smule.com

    We also want to make sure the app works even better for you than before. So please let us know at support@smule.com if there is anything amiss. We are always listening and working on further improvements.

Version 3.1.1 (May 20, 2014)

    + The pitch arrow on the singing screen went through a much needed tune-up in order to be more responsive to your singing. Yep, you'll see higher scores than before, that's a good thing, you're just that good. :)
    + The mic gain slider now shows the gain value to better help control the loudness or softness of your vocals. Remember though, the gain slider is all relative to how loud or soft your vocals are when you're recording.
    + We've heard you! You can now clear the cache from the "Settings" menu and not have to delete and reinstall the app to clear up the phone memory.
    + Show the estimated download time to help detect slow networks.
    + A few housecleaning fixes under the hood.

    3.0.2 Update
    Hello happy shiny Sing!ers, a bunch of things under the hood was fixed in this update.
    + Crackling audio on the iPhone 5S is fixed. The iPhone 5S is so freaking fast we had to fix the underlying audio architecture to handle the speed. Thanks @Maria66 for pointing it out initially.
    + Sharing on the iPhone 5S is fixed. Sorry about missing this bug, but you can now get back to sharing all your singing goodness. :)
    + Support for iPad landscape view during singing. Finally! We are continuing to work on more landscape optimizations for the next update. Thanks for being patient.

It needs the beefy new processors in order to be able to do the real-time visual and audio FX at the same time. Visualizing voice is always tricky, so we think this is a fun addition. Let us know what you think as we definitely want to work on making it even better.

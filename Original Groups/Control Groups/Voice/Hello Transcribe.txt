    Model configs:

    A model config (configuration) is a Whisper model combined with transcription and rendering options.

    Previously, you could only set the Whisper model, CoreML enabled etc. in Settings. This meant that changing the settings was awkward, and you could not change them while doing a transcription.

    Now, you can create multiple configs and use them for different tasks and change them while transcribing. Changing the config will restart the transcription. This means now you can:
    • Have a "fast" default config to quickly transcribe something and change to a "accurate" config when you want a more accurate result.
    • Tweak a config during transcription (e.g. turn translation on/off or change the audio language).
    • Set your favourite config as the default and copy an existing config to tweak it.

    Two new advanced options have been added:
    • Per-word timestamps. *This is experimental*. Each word will have a timestamp.
    • Beam search size. A smaller beam search is faster but will create less accurate results. Before 3.0 Hello Transcribe used the "greedy" search method, which is the same as a search size of 1.

    Other:

    • App will not go to sleep while a transcription is in progress.

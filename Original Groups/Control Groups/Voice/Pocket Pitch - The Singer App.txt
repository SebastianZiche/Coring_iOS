App Description
Pocket Pitch is a simple tool for singers who need to be able to quickly identify or play notes. This app combines a pitch pipe and piano so that you have two of the quintessential tools of a singer!

The Pitch Pipe is its primary function. It uses professionally recorded sound so that the audio experience is just like carrying around a pitch pipe with you.

The Keyboard allows for 6 octaves of pitches, ideal for vocal warm-ups or plunking out notes.

The Info page allows the user to provide feedback directly to the developer. The goal is to make the best free mobile app for singers, so input is greatly appreciated.

A special thanks to the various contributors to Pocket Pitch:

Md. Atikur Rahman, Programming
Greg Francis, Audio Recording
Tony Sherg, Design Consultant

Version 2.3 (May 31, 2016)
    A new menu for the pitch pipe adding grid layout, f octave, toggle mode, and blow mode!

    Grid layout is mainly to help users with smaller phones who may prefer larger buttons.
    The F octave pitch pipe was added because two is better than one!
    Toggle mode was added just incase users don't like holding down the button.

    Blow mode was added because why the heck not. Now you can blow into your phone to play a pitch just like a real pitch pipe!
Version 2.2 (Feb 25, 2016)
    The audio files of the Pitch Pipe function have been updated. The original audio files are of a person blowing into an actual pitch pipe. This was used for people who would prefer that authentic sound instead of an electronic tone. It was discovered that some of the audio had some tuning variations at times of 10 Hz +/-. This was most likely due to imperfections in the physical Pitch Pipe used in the recordings. This isn’t a huge variation to the ears of a casual user, but it was worth improving upon. The audio’s pitches have been adjusted to now be within 2 Hz +/-, but most often it is less. (Note: this is using 440Hz tuning)

    

If you find further problems with this audio, please feel free to email me directly at johnpocketpitch@yahoo.com. I would prefer to fix problems rather than have people dismiss the App.

    

Thank you,
    John Walbolt

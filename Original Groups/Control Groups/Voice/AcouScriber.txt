App Description
AcouScriber is a simple light-weight tool that performs conversion between text and speech.

On the one hand, it utilizes Apple's built-in speech recognition engine to transcribe human voice into text, bringing a type-free feature to users who prefer using their voice as input. The clean and self-explanatory user interface allows for an instant switch between keyboard editing and voice recognition, supporting a wide range of languages and delivering accurate and satisfactory text that can be sent as a message or email, or shared on your social network.

On the other hand, text can be read out with synthesized voice by a simple tap. This enables the reception of information without having to look at the screen, which comes in handy for users with disabilities, or users preferring audible content over text. Multiple parameters can be tuned, and various languages and voices can be selected to generate the speech that is mostly pleasing to the ear.

With the additional pro features, the user experience is further enhanced by a waveform display that serves as an instantaneous feedback on the intensity of your voice input, and a progress indication and highlighting that keep track of the currently spoken word.

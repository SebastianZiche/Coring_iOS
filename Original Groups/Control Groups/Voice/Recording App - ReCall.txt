How do I record both incoming & outgoing calls?
-------------------------------------------------
Just tap on the red recording button and it will walk you through the steps to record calls with your cell phone. Watch our tutorial by tapping on the help icon. Unlimited recording plans are available for call recording using cellular and your phone caller ID.

How do I record a call conversation using a private ID?
-------------------------------------------------------
Just open the call recorder app and call out. The recording will start automatically. No complex merging of calls, putting calls on hold and fumbling to start the recording and trap in the process..

Can I make an international call?
--------------------------------
Yes. The second phone number and recording line allows you to make international calls for cheap and also record those international calls.

What if there is no local recording line for my country?
------------------------------------------------------
No problem. You can set the app by going to the Dial pad -> Menu -> Use App for Recording option which allows you to record calls from the app itself without your iPhone cellular calling plan. This also allows devices such as iPad or iPod touch that does not have calling capability to record calls as well.

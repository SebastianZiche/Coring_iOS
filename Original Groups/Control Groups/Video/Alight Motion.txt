Version 4.0 (Nov 15, 2021)
    Alight Motion 4.0 gives you powerful new tools to build sophisticated, dynamic scenes!

    Coordinate complex animations by using parenting to link layers and rig character joints, then easily add dynamic motion or cut between shots with moving 2.5D cameras. And because all layers now have a Z coordinate in addition to X and Y, you can use cameras to create parallax motion and zoom through layers as well!

    We’ve also been working hard to make your editing process more convenient. You can zoom in for detailed editing with a simple pinch gesture, and use two fingers to pan around your project. The improved media browser allows you to add multiple images or videos at once. You can even copy parts of a layer’s style, which can include everything from its position, color, opacity, effects, and even animations, and paste it to another layer.

    In addition to functional changes, we have also been working very hard to improve rendering performance. Preview lag should be greatly reduced in this update, or totally eliminated for many projects. Of course, Alight Motion is built without limits, allowing you the ultimate in flexibility, which means you can always build projects that are so complex that preview lag becomes unavoidable, but with 4.0 you can push the limits further than ever before, and we’ll keep working to find ways to squeeze out even more performance.

    We’re really excited about this update, and can’t wait to see what you create with it!

Rediscover your art and the world around you with the unique prism effect of Crystaliq. Explore and share different perspectives on the multi-dimensional reality we live in.

The tools you get to explore your authentic worldview:

14 CRYSTAL FILTERS
· Finetune prism filter to perfectly fit your photo and video
· Blur the edges of a crystalized pattern
· Add chromatic aberration
· Create a more dynamic, realistic way to animate the photo with parallax effect

30+ COLOR PRESETS
· Find ideal color correction that matches your taste. From clear cyan tones to thick magentas, wherever your inspiration leads you.

BLOOM
· Create a dreamy and foggy vintage look imitating a greasy camera effect.

ANIMATION
· Add motion to your photo by simply moving your finger over an image. You’ll achieve cool trippy patterns for animations of up to 30 seconds.

VIDEO EDITOR

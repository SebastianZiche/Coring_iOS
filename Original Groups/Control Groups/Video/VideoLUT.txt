App Description
Transform your videos and images into cinematic masterpieces with VideoLUT, the ultimate color-grading app! With over 2500 presets, you can easily import, edit, and apply LUTs to create stunning videos and photos. Plus, VideoLUT allows you to record videos and take photos with your imported LUTs, giving you the ultimate creative control.

Whether you're a professional filmmaker or a casual iPhone photographer, VideoLUT is the perfect app for you. It comes with powerful editing tools that allow you to color grade your videos and images with ease. You can even create your own LUTs and share them with other users via QR codes or apps like Lumafusion.

VideoLUT supports a variety of LUT formats, including DaVinci Resolve 3D Cube LUT (.cube) and Autodesk 3D LUT (.3dl). You can import .cube, .3dl, and 512x512 .png LUT tables, and save or import cube files to iCloud, Dropbox, and other storage apps.

But that's not all – VideoLUT also lets you visualize LUTs in 3D, export them as LUT images (.png), and share them as .cube 16, 32, or 33 (DaVinci Resolve 3D Cube LUT) with other apps or your desktop. You can also match colors from images and build new LUTs from the result, and use RGB, HSL, CMYK, LAB, and Skin Masks and Curves for added control.

With VideoLUT's auto white balance, Mackbet table detection and correction, split toning, color wheels, and other adjust tools, you have everything you need to perfect your videos and images. Mix multiple LUTs to create new ones, convert Filmic Pro LUTS, and even preprocess RAW photos for added flexibility.

App Description
Sell your film camera. Throw away your disposable. Because with this app you’ll have the ability to create photos indistinguishable from real film through effects you will not find in any other app.

Grace your photos with smooth vintage pastel colors, dreamy glow, tasteful light leaks, and many other nostalgic visual garnishes to make them look like a lazy midsummer afternoon of 1976.

It’s simple. It’s sleek. It’s powerful. It’s free. It's just begging to be downloaded. Feel free to check out @daze.cam on instagram. And if you haven't noticed - the old wave is the new wave.

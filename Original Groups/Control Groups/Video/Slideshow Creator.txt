Version 9.0.1 (Apr 19, 2017)
    Animoto is bringing sexy back. With this release, we've made some design improvements that will make this app really really ridiculously good looking.

    We could've stopped there. And it would have been an awesome release.

    *5 minutes later*

    But we didn't! Our team went on a vision quest, and we traveled the world for inspiration. We wanted to deliver something extra special for our Marketing Video Builder Customers.

    We studied thousands of years of ancient history to figure out how people have historically gotten an item from point a to point b. We explored everything from the Pony Express in the mid 1800's, to Drone Delivery experiments today!

    That's when we realized our users were plugging their phones into their computers, downloading their photos & videos, and then hopefully uploading the correct files to their Marketing Video projects on the web. This sounded worse than the Pony Express to us.

    We're not promising to deliver photos & videos via Drone yet, BUT with this update, our Marketing Video Builder Customers will now have the superpower of uploading photos & videos from their phone DIRECTLY into their existing Marketing Video Builder Projects on the web!

    Welcome to version 9.0 people! It'll only get better from here.

    Plus lots of pesky bugs have been squashed in this release, along with improvements to overall app stability.

Version 8.6.0 (Feb 28, 2017)
    You know the feeling of being interrupted while you are doing something? Then you go back to whatever it was that you were doing later on, but you can't remember where you left off! Was I adding chocolate syrup to my ice cream sundae? Or was it whipped cream!? We hate that feeling at Animoto too!! Now your in-progress projects remember exactly where you were in the process.

    We've also added overflow controls in the video list! You know those buttons that look like meatballs? You can now share, copy, or delete videos you've created right from the video list screen. If you hate unnecessary steps, you're going to love this update. If you love unnecessary steps, you'll still love this update too, just not as much.

    Last but not least, with this release, you can now see (but not edit YET) the in-progress projects you've been working on from the web!

Version 7.5.0 (Mar 7, 2016)
    After our last release we really put our app under the microscope and found a few things that weren't quite right.

    Turns out they were microbes.

    So we took the app back out from under the microscope (which made it a lot easier to use!) and found a couple bugs to fix. Enjoy making great videos with even fewer bugs in this release - and let us know if you want to buy a gently-used microscope.

    Prepare for ludicrous speed! Before when you wanted to preview or produce a video, you had enough time to go mow your lawn, take a nap, and build a house before it was done loading. With this update, you can still mow your lawn, but you'll only have enough time to cut one single piece of grass before your videos are ready.

    Plus lots of pesky bugs have been squashed in this release, along with improvements to overall app stability.

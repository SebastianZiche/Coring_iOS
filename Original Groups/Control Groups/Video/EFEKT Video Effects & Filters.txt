App Description
EFEKT Video Maker by Picsart is an innovative app that allows you to create unique videos and photos with movement and sound reacting effects. Express yourself in new compelling ways and get noticed!

EFEKT takes your reality, as seen through your camera lens, and morphs it into something unlike anything you’ve seen before.

Start by selecting one of our effects for your photo, video, or slomo, and begin shooting. It’s that simple! Shoot live or import your own videos, customize effects to your needs, export them in FULL HD, and share them on Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube.

New effects & features are added monthly!

50 UNIQUE EFFECTS AND COUNTING
There's an effect for every style and personality.

Blabla: Words, words, and more words.
Dream: A trippy, distorted, colorful gradient
Bubbles: Fun bubbly particles + a champagne mode
Glass: It kinda looks like glass, EFEKTed glass ;)
Spring: Lots of dots or squares or triangles
Rainbow: Our signature effect, because RGB is love
Spark: Flying glossy magical particles
Flame: Dancing fire, burning desire
Interlace: Glitch yourself out of existence

60+ PARAMETERS TO PLAY WITH
Customize each effect to add a personal touch to your videos and photos. Every effect has unique personalization options to experiment with. Everything works in real-time so you can play with the controls even while you're recording.

AUDIO REACTIVITY
Choose the Audio Reactive feature to make effects react to sound and make your own music video. Tap on the little white circle at the right-center of your phone screen and start speaking or singing. Or play your favorite song and lose yourself to dance. You can also import videos with music.

HUMAN MODE
Human mode lets you apply effects only on yourself, people around you, or on everything else but humans. Available only on iPhone Xs or later.

20+ UNIQUE SHAPES
All effects can be masked with shapes to add a new dimension to your creations. Choose from stars, diamonds, hearts, and way more. All shapes can be inverted and transformed in any way.

10+ FUN FONTS
Type any phrase that comes to mind and finish it off with one of our fun fonts. Move your saying around until you’re happy with its placement and movement.

DRAWING TOOL
Draw anything with your finger directly on the camera screen while shooting or on any part of your video and the effect will follow your finger in real-time.

COMBINE FEATURE
Gives you the ability to layer multiple effects on top of one other. Please don't go overboard!

Tag your videos and photos with #madewithefekt and we might feature them on our Instagram @efekt.app.

    Hello ios13!

    We have a huge update for you! We added lots of new features and updated the old ones. Now you can combine the effects with different shapes to create dazzling stories. Add text to your videos and make them react to the movement and sound. It sounds exciting, isn't it?

    We also added human mode, which finds humans and applies effects only on them. Or the other way around! It's so much fun! We wanted to bring this feature to all of our users, but because of hardware limitations it's only available from iPhone Xs and up.

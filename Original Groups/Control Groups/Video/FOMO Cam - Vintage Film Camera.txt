App Description
FOMO camera, your casual photographer.

With FOMO, you’ll make photographs that look and sound like real film rolls pulled out of storage 20 years ago. Based on the film proofs, we 100% restore the color, texture and noise of the film.

After taking a picture, we can analog presets - including curves, grains, dust, light leak, date.

FOMO Vip Subscription options:

Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be the same amount unless otherwise notified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active period. Any unused portion of a free trail period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication.

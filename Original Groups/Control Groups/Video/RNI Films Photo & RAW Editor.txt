App Promotional Text
Enjoy the real film look while shooting digital. Create a real vintage & film vibe, add real film grain effect and edit your photos in only a few taps.
App Description
Get real film look while shooting digital.

At RNI we always wanted to transfer the true character of analogue film to digital medium. So we did by digitising our library of analog slides and negatives, building their profiles and packaging those profiles into a lightweight and easy to use mobile app.

RNI Films is a great mobile companion for those who appreciate the beauty of analogue photography. And this little app enables creators to bring the artistic flair of film into their mobile workflow.

Many professional photographers find our film profiles to be more sophisticated and true to real film than rivals. That's because we work really hard to recreate every subtle aspect of real film, with great attention to general accuracy, colour separation, skin tones and grain texture.

RNI's film-simulating expertise is proven by time and appreciated by photographers from all over the globe. Our desktop and mobile solutions have been praised in a number of independent online reviews, so don't hesitate to search for RNI Films online to find out more about our products, philosophy and approach.

REAL FILM FILTERS
The RNI Films' filters are born from real film stocks and split into categories that include negative, slide, instant, black & white and vintage. The app comes with a generous introductory package of free film filters. Also additional filter packages can be added via in-app purchase.

ADJUSTMENT TOOLS
Use RNI image adjustment tools to make sure your images perfectly meet your creative vision. You can crop and rotate, alter the brightness, contrast, and colour, enhance shadows and highlights, add vignette and real film grain, and much more.

RAW EDITOR
RNI Films can open and edit RAW files from your mobile or third-party camera*. Some minor image artefacts may be seen while editing RAW in the app's viewport which uses draft mode. Those artefacts won't be there on export. Generally, the quality of the output of this little app is comparable with professional desktop software.
* Your third-party camera RAW format needs to be supported by iOS. Please refer to your iOS version documentation for more details.

VIDEO GRADING (beta)
RNI Films can colour-grade your videos. All its film filters and many editing tools now support video. More video-focused tools and features will be added later. At the moment video grading is in beta. So if you spot any bugs or issues—please let us know at support@reallyniceimages.com

SHARING
Share your photos to your social networks directly from the app. Supported networks include Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

IN-APP WORKFLOW
The RNI Films app is simple, intuitive and straightforward to use. It’s designed with high efficiency in mind, from opening a photo to sharing the result. No clutter, no extra taps to ‘hide/unhide that panel’, no unnecessary confirmation steps – everything is streamlined and simple for your convenience.

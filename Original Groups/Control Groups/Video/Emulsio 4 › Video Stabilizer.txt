Turn shaky 4K into cinematic
Photo and Video (Applications)
Free
App Promotional Text
*** Emulsio 4 introduces HDR video processing, now runs on Mac (+ iPhone & iPad), and offers an updated user experience. ***
App Description
** Macworld Conference ‘Best of Show’ winner **

Want to make your videos smoother and more professional? Emulsio is a video editing application that automatically removes camera shake, and lets you make cinematic motion just like professional movie editors. Emulsio lets you use advanced stabilization techniques, adjust the stabilizer strength, preview the result within the app, and even view a before/after video comparison. You can also trim or cut any part of the video. Emulsio is a must-have for all movie makers!

Emulsio can be tried out for free and the watermark can be removed through an in-app purchase. Available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.


KEY FEATURES
• Import any video from your album or any compatible video file.
• Choose the stabilization strength necessary to efficiently remove distracting camera vibrations.
• Compensate horizontal, vertical and rotational camera motion, as well as rolling shutter distortion. Besides, Emulsio can handle black borders by momentarily decreasing stabilization strength.
• Assess stabilizer effect and settings by playing both the original and stabilized videos simultaneously.
• Remove any part of the video. This is a non-destructive process, you can always change your mind until final export.
• HDR video handling: HDR videos can be processed and exported with their full dynamic range. HLG & PQ transfer functions are available
• Export the stabilized video to any compatible application (Mail, Messages, Facebook, Dropbox, Evernote, iMovie,…).
• Fully exposed video encoder: format (mov, mp4, m4a), codec (H.264, HEVC), quality/bitrate, resolution to customize output (smaller size or better quality).
• Transcode videos: skip the stabilizer and just use the transcoding feature to export to a small file size using a more optimized codec.
• Very fast video processing on your iPhone or iPad. No Internet connection required.
• Support for high-speed videos (up to 240 FPS) which preserve their frame rate after export.
• Modern OS features: import and export of HEVC (compatible devices only), Drag & Drop, Peek & Pop, modern video access (browsing & searching).
• Pro Pack or Pro Plan: HDR video handling, better accuracy for 4K videos, improved correction of rolling shutter distortion including third party sensor calibration, and removal of the watermark.

PRICING
You can unlock all features either through Pro Pack, a one-time purchase, or through Pro Plan, an affordable subscription. Pro Pack upgrade pricing is also available if you own a previous version.

    - iOS 8 Photo/Video Edits: Stabilized video is now stored as an edited version of the existing video (which can be reverted to original, if needed), for easier album management.
    - iOS 8 Video Metadata Preservation: Emulsio now saves processed metadata along with your video, meaning that you don't have to analyse the video again if you want to edit the stabilizer strength.
    - Import from iOS 8 Documents: Emulsio can now import video files from iOS 8 documents library (which can itself connect to most cloud services).
    - Export to iOS 8 Documents: Emulsio can now export to the documents library.

    • Removed the 30-second limitation when the Pro Pack hasn't been activated. You can now process videos of any duration (watermark remains though, and can be removed with In-App Purchase).

Version 2.0.4 (Jul 16, 2014)
    - Polish localization
    - Portuguese localization

    - Videos that were previously time-cropped are now available within Emulsio
    - Pro Pack price is now correctly displayed in user's currency (would sometimes fail under unusual configurations)
Version 2.0.2 (Mar 26, 2014)
    Bug Fixes & Enhancements
    - Fixed a bug that would prevent video picker from displaying videos
    - Fixed a crash that could happen when processing video that were previously edited in another app
    - Minor user interface fixes
Version 2.0.1 (Mar 11, 2014)
    - Localized to German.

    Emulsio is now completely translated to German.



    - Improved video source handling.

    Emulsio now allows importing videos that have been copied through the Camera Connection Kit (or some other means), it is not restricted to camera roll anymore.



    - Improved processing of video captured with other devices (Android phones, GoPro). In some situations, videos could be lacking metadata that would lead to black image (or translated image) in preview and export. Emulsio now reconstructs erroneous or missing metadata and correctly processes those videos.



    - Export failure correction.

    Emulsio will no longer fail when exporting a movie that has different duration for audio/video tracks. This was typically happening when processing a movie captured by another app, or imported from some other source.



    - Output video duration fix.

    Exporting a video over 30sec (no Pro Pack) would trim it to 2 seconds. This no longer happens, the exported video will be trimmed to 30 seconds instead when Pro Pack is not active.



    - Other minor visual enhancements.
Version 2.0 (Feb 26, 2014)
    General
    - Movie Stiller becomes Emulsio. Completely new version 2.0 with a new application icon.
    - New user interface. Emulsio provides a more direct and interactive access to stabilization tools and previewing within the app.
    - Emulsio is now free with In-App purchase to remove 30-second limitation and watermark. Customers of version 1.x get these features for free.
    - iOS 7 Optimized. Emulsio is making use of new video capabilities (compositor) only available on iOS 7 to enable realtime previewing and fast video rendering.
    - Live Comparison. You can now play both the original and stabilized videos simultaneously to assess stabilizer effect and settings. Every change is immediately taken into account and reflected in the live comparison.

    Stabilization Improvements
    - Improved Stabilization for Videos: Emulsio now tackles wobble distortion and motion discontinuity. We've worked hard to make a smart stabilization method that is also fast.
    - Wobble Distortion: New stabilizer adds handling of rolling shutter distortion that occurs when recording movies with rapid motion of the camera. Such video typically get wobble artifacts (oblique distortion) that Emulsio can remove.
    - Discontinuity Handling: Rapidly changing scenes and camera flashes typically create motion discontinuity, but these no longer affect the resulting stabilization.
    - Black Border Handling. Previous versions of Emulsio (known as Movie Stiller) would generate black borders when motion compensation was too high. Emulsio can now handle this situation by momentarily decreasing stabilization strength to prevent black borders from happening.

    Optimized for iPhone 5s/iPad Air
    - Optimized for 64-bit. We've done the maths for you: Emulsio on iPhone 5s is twice as fast as iPhone 5. We've also tested 32-bit vs. 64-bit on the same iPhone 5s: 64-bit brings you an additional 35% processing speed and matches desktop class performances for video editing for the first time on a mobile phone.
    - Handling of high speed 120 FPS (frame-per-second) videos.
    Stabilization is performed at original video speed, and exported videos still are 120 FPS, allowing slow-motion editing (specifically for iPhone 5s).

    Stabilizer Control
    - Stabilizer Data Reporting. As a more advanced tool, this allows to review internal stabilization data such as the instantaneous displacement of video frame along X,Y axes, rotational compensation, wobble correction, etc. These are reported both as live figures and graphically in video overlay.
    - Adjustable Stabilization Strength & Profile. Stabilizer strength can be adjusted depending on quality of original movie. You can further change internal stabilizer behavior by choosing stabilizer profile. "Cinametic" profile allows smoother, motion-picture like camera motion, while "Vibrations" focuses more on removing smaller camera shakes while preserving original camera motion.
    - Frame by frame image inspection.

    Video Editing & Export
    - Non-destructive Time Editing. Removing some part of the video is very easy with Emulsio, and you can always change your mind until final video export.
    - Export Options. Once editing is finished, you can export back to your album, social networks like Facebook, or any other app capable of handling videos.

App App Store Notes
If you’ve ever wondered why certain videos on social media look so much better than others, we can explain: It’s because the good ones are made with apps like Adobe Premiere Rush CC. One of our favorite features is one-click auto-duck audio mixing, which does not add quacking noises but rather automatically adjusts the volume of background music during voice-overs.

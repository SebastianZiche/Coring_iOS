I change the default aspect ratio to 9:16 portrait for IGTV but you can change this in the preview screen anytime! New percentage progress is added to the export screen. Added IGTV layout which moves the landscape videos to the upper third of the screen so it can be viewable even with open controls in the app. I m trying to make the best app possible so if you have any ideas on how I could improve it please send an email to me matekovacs.com or message me on twitter kovacsamate.

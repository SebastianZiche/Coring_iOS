    ABILITY CHANGE THE SPEED OF YOUR VIDEO CLIPS
    Under the clip edit screen, we've added a feature where you can adjust how fast a video clip should be played. Great for making slowmo videos even if you haven't shot them in slow motion or speeding up things to make timelapses.

    OTHER IMPROVEMENTS & BUG FIXES

    - Added Twitter sharing option.
    - Fixed a rare bug some users are experiencing where there was no audio while editing a video project.

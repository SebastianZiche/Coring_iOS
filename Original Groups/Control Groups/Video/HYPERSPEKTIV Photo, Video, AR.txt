~ Privacy Policy ~

Phantom Force, LP, also referred to as PF in this Privacy Policy, is the creator of the HYPERSPEKTIV application which we refer to as the App. PF does not require that you reveal any personally identifiable information to use our App. We or our third party service providers, such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Yahoo, may collect information for technical support or other business support reasons such as for use in analytics and to improve the performance, experience and reliability of the App.

HOW WE MANAGE TRUE-DEPTH FACE DATA

Hyperspektiv utilizes Apple's Augmented Reality APIs (specifically ARKit & TrueDepth) in order to provide filters that react intelligently to people's bodies. On newer devices, in selfie mode, this requires that we use ARKit's Face Tracking mode.

We do not utilize your True Depth face data, nor do we store it anywhere. The only data used is the outline of your body, so we can apply filters to it.

Version 2.5.3 (Feb 14, 2020)
    2.5 is a major upgrade: Welcome to AR, HyperSquad!

    * 2.5.3 fixes a handful of UI bugs.

    —AR Body Detection

    With the latest iPhones (NOTE: iPhone XR and newer only) you can now isolate and apply filters to a person or their background in real-time. Point your camera at someone (or yourself) and tap the glowing ‘Body Recognition’ button in the top left of the screen. This is an *experimental* feature that adds much creative potential, we can’t wait to see what you create! NOTE: Body Recognition currently only works in live-capture and runs on these ARKit 3-enabled devices: iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPad Pro (running iOS 13).

    —Photo to Video

    You can now instantly turn photos into videos! Try opening a photo from your Camera Roll and simply hold down the capture button to save a video. If you want to create a still photo simply toggle into “Still” mode.

    —Full HD (4k and above) Export

    For our subscribers - imported photos and videos will now export at their native resolutions. That means you can get 4k (and above!) output from Hyperspektiv! We fixed a limitation in the 2.0 engine that was keeping the max output at 1080p. For our free users - you get HD as well! It will be limited to 1080p.

    —60 FPS Live Capture

    On newer devices, enjoy our complimentary update from 30fps to 60fps.

    -One new free filter: SPECTRUM
    -Two new Premium filters: DOMA and POLLEN.
    -Completely redesigned our graphics engine which should make things run faster and smoother as well as tons of bug fixes.
Version 2.5.2 (Feb 12, 2020)
    2.5 is a major upgrade: Welcome to AR, HyperSquad!

    2.5.2 is a patch update that makes our new "photo to video" mode clearer to understand and easier to use.

    2.5.1

    - Fixes a bug where video output was lower bitrate than it was supposed to be.

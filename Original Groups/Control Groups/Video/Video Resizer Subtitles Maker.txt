Version 1.2 (Jun 4, 2019)
    Hey there,
    In this version, I fixed a ​bug about the video export quality!
    - Now you can choose high quality or standard.
    - I also added a progress timer for the blurring, so you will not think it's stuck.
    - The app does not go to sleep while exporting, so it'll be much more reliable
    - Removed a green line which appeared for some of the users of the app after exporting
    - I also fixed various little bugs, thank you for reporting those, James and Mark!

Version 1.0.2 (Jun 23, 2018)
    Hey there,

    The Second update is here, and it contains some small bug fixes.

    I change the default aspect ratio to 9:16 portrait for IGTV but you can change this in the preview screen anytime!
    New percentage progress is added to the export screen.
    Added IGTV layout, which moves the landscape videos to the upper third of the screen, so it can be viewable even with open controls in the app.

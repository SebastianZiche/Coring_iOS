    • DATAMOSH on an iPhone. The unique effect that inspired artists like Kanye West or A$AP Mob to glitch their music videos is now available in Glitché. Decode up to three videos from your camera roll simultaneously or experiment with real-time recording.

    • New PIXEL and SORT filters, complementing the set of irreplaceable Glitché effects.
    • Glitch text generator to randomly style each letter. Huge set of new fonts. Designed text can be copied and pasted into any other app (for example, to a TikTok profile or an Instagram comment).
    • New AR-mask in the shape of the Glitché logo.
    • Tons of improvements to filters and overall application performance.
    • Redesigned interface, animated toolbars and much more.

    First of all, we would like to thank the Gorillaz and personally Jamie Hewlett for choosing our app to create the artworks and the global promos for their new album Humanz. Eight official singles with covers created using Glitché are available on iTunes; the amazing videos for the new tracks also created in Glitché have already been viewed more than 11,000,000 times on YouTube, and a lot of GIFs created by the band in our app have flown across the twitter from Radio Beats 1 to Jean-Michel Jarre, who also took part in the recording of Humanz. Even the avatar the Gorillaz use on Facebook is animated using Glitché. It's unbelievable and we are very honoured to be a part of this story!

    Next: our congratulations to Travis Scott for getting his album Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight to platinum status! You probably remember that the cover for this album was created by the legendary photographer Nick Knight using Glitché.

    … as well as HYPEBEAST for the material about our app.

    • The BRUSH setting has become an independent filter, combining the functions of LIQUIFY
    • New DARK filter for exploring the dark sides of glitch art for camera, photo and video editors
    • Now it's enough to go to the next screen to apply the effect to the entire video without controlling the recording process manually. The long-awaited feature
    • We fixed the bug in which the video became shorter when adding new filters
    • Latest photos and videos from the camera roll are now displayed on the main screen

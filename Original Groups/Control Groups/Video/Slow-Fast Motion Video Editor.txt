Here's what our users are saying:

Most Amazing App Ever!
"This app NEEDS to be given more than five stars. The app is incredibly easy to use and it's easy to slow down or speed up sections of my videos. I've spent actual money on several other apps and those just do not compare to this one at all. After searching so long for an app with slow motion capabilities, I've finally found this amazing one and I'll never switch."

Great App!
"It's hard to find a no-strings-attached app that allows you to fast forward your videos. I downloaded 7 other apps before downloading this one, and man am I glad I found this one!"
by Amy617394846 - United States - Dec 30, 2015

Stupendously Awesome!!!!
"This app is fantastic. Does exactly what it said it does. Simple, very easy to use and well made overall. Gets straight to the point and the ads aren't even irritating at all! And it allows you to speed it up and slow it down at random parts. Thank you for this wonderful app!"

In a time where everybody is looking for privacy, security and control of their messages, n-gage messenger is the number #1 App that does exactly that.

You decide who gets to screenshot, share and record.

Also includes No copying, forwarding or sharing without your permission.



BE CONFIDENT: n-gage gives you the confidence to say anything as every message, chat and conversation cannot escape between you and your contact.



BE YOURSELF: Ever sent a message that you later regret, or an embarrassing photo after a late night? Recall messages, photos, videos and files using Take Back.



STAY PROTECTED: Send time sensitive information using Self Destruct, or keep certain information password protected at yours, and your contact’s end with Safe message.



STAY CONNECTED: Sync your account on multiple devices and numbers, and start conversations from wherever you left off from.



BE VOCAL: Enjoy 1-to-1 or Group Video and Voice calls with groups. Laugh, shout, and whisper for as long as you want because with N-Gage, conversations never escape the room.



BE FUN: Express yourself to your family and friends with stickers and gifs.



BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY…..



WE DON’T SELL YOU: We take privacy seriously, and our encryption technology means that we have ZERO KNOWLEDGE about you - so we cannot give third parties access to your data.



Download to join the Privacy revolution. n-gage with confidence, with privacy and security

in your hands.

App Description
The Snikket app allows you to join a worldwide communication network. Use the app for communicating with friends, family and colleagues without surrendering your data to large corporations.

Important Note: To get started with the app you need an invite to a Snikket service, or run your own. The app will not work unless you have an invite to join a Snikket service.

Snikket allows you to use a service provided by someone you trust. This could be an organisation, simply a techie friend or family member.

Both the app and service are 100% free and open-source software.

What's New

Version 1.2 (Mar 22, 2022)
    New features:

    - Audio calls now use the earpiece by default, with an option to switch to speaker mode
    - You can now send and receive locations with contacts
    - Support for *styling* to add more _emphasis_ to your chats
    - Detect and select a default telephony provider (compatible with JMP.chat/Cheogram)

    In addition to the new features, we've made many small but important user interface improvements throughout the app. Some of the more notable fixes and improvements:

    - Improved default pictures for contacts and groups
    - The notification count badge on the home screen is more reliable
    - Your display name is now synchronized if you have multiple devices
    - The message input area is now scrollable, handy if you are writing a long message
    - Fixed some glitches that occur on iOS 15

    We have also begun adding support for non-English languages to the app. Hurra!

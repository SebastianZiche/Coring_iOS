App Description
XTER TEXTER allows you to control when you are ready to be notified of incoming messages. Instantly receive notifications after class or when you leave work; with XTER TEXTER you can choose where and when you’re available.
XTER TEXTER is the best way to message your friends and family without distracting them. Notifications from this app are delayed until you’re actively using your phone. Set times and locations where you don’t want to be distracted and you won’t know you’ve received a message until after class or when you leave work. This app discourages texting while driving by monitoring your travel speed and delays notifications while you’re on the move. So, before you send a message to someone during their presentation or while they’re on the road, text responsibly using XTER TEXTER instead.
XTER TEXTER uses GPS data for do-not-disturb functionality. GPS data is required at all times. Some features might not work in low GPS signal areas or after shutting down the app. Continuous access to GPS data is required for the proper functionality of the do-not-disturb and notifications functions.

Just provide a username and a photo of yourself preferably! then join any WiFi network and let the app discover other users on the same network. You can either be Online or Offline . You can invite other Online users to chat or send them Spy Messages in case they don t feel like chatting right now or you can send Spy Messages to Offline users. A Spy Message can contain both text and photo. Spy Messages will remain archived until you actually decide to delete them. Remember though you are allowed to send a limited number of Spy Messages per user! So think carefully what you want to say or show! You can sign in with AppleID Google or Facebook. Have fun!!

This will be brought to you by Tarsier Secure Chat which is powered by DIM. DIM an open source project that provides the protocol and system architecture. which is designed for the next generation Internet that is coming. DIM network could serve as a social network in which users can send messages or digital assets freely. Besides that DIM can serve the Internet of Things as well. Allowing software to communicate autonomously. Although other platforms are owned and operated by a single corporation who has full control over everything DIM network is decentralized and there is no one server company or person running it. Anyone can join and run their own services on DIM network. But how does this work When someone joins DIM network with their servers they are called Service Providers. Since DIM network is open a Service Provider can have its own set of services while complying with DIM Protocol. User identification is generated and verified using a cryptographically algorithm and no longer authenticated by a single corporation. Because of this Service Providers cannot monetize the user s privacy or data they must compete by providing better services and a better ecosystem. This means that all the Service Providers share the same potential user base. And users could choose the Service Provider that fits their needs at anytime. Nowadays the internet users place greater emphasis on protecting their privacy many people are concerned that their private information may be illegally used. I hope this app can build a more safety social network to allow who don t want to provide too much information to the man in the middle can still keep in touch with their friends freely. Hope this application can bring you more convenience. Enjoy it!

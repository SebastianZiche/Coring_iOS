1214988510,0,Groups Control Groups Messenger Apps Ezza,Social Networking,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,64.57,8,0,0,1,Ezza is by far the most secure way to communicate because it decentralizes chat and file sharing thereby significantly minimizing the chances of your data being compromised or hacked. Most chat and file sharing apps give your data to a middle man known as the cloud. The cloud saves your data. Sometimes insecure. Sometimes indefinitely. The cloud is where most data is compromised and data breaches occur. Why risk your sensitive data The safest and most secure way to send something is to hand it to the person it s meant for. Not by giving it to some stranger in the cloud. No matter how secure they say the cloud is someone will always have the key. Ezza may never replace your favorite messaging apps you already use however Ezza does offer you a safe option to share your most sensitive messages and files. The proprietary technology behind Ezza connects you directly to your contact through a Secure Session similar to a phone call. You simply initiate a session with one of your contacts at which point their Ezza app will notify them to join the secure session. Once they join the secure session the two of you will be directly connected to each other. Any data transferred in that secure session will never be stored in the cloud. Ever. Create your Free Ezza account today by selecting a unique username then provide your email address and create a password. After that update your Ezza profile by providing your name and summary about yourself this will help others find you on Ezza should you choose to make your profile public. Invite others to join you on Ezza by sharing your unique Ezza Profile Link or Ezza QRCode . You may also search for someone through Ezza s public directory. Everything is secure peer to peer and never saved in the cloud: Chat messages Photos Videos Documents Audio recordings Web links Voice calls Ezza is free to use as much as you want. In order to keep it free we include as little advertisements as possible.

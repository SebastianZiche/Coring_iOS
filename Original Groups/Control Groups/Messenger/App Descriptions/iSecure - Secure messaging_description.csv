However before hitting the send button they can use the iSecure app to set a password for the message. This password can be anything the user chooses and can be as simple or complex as they like. Once the password is set the message is encrypted and can only be opened by the recipient with the correct password. The recipient will receive a notification that they have received a password protected message and will be prompted to enter the password in order to read it. The iSecure app provides an additional layer of security for users who want to ensure that their messages are only read by the intended recipient. This can be particularly useful for messages containing sensitive or confidential information.

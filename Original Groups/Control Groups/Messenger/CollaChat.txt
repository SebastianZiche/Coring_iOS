App Description
CollaChat is an open source private and decentralized messaging app owned by no one and everyone. It is aimed to leverage blockchain technology to put users back in control of their digital communication, while preserve user experiences that they know and love.

Distinguished from the traditional messaging apps, CollaChat has three most important features which revolutionize the communication infrastructure:
- Decentralized
Colla Network is an unstoppable Web3 decentralized peer-to-peer communication and storage network, Colla DApp (e.g. CollaChat) connects to it via Colla Node. There is no centralized storage and control of user data, users can specify which Node(s) or even easily setup own Node(s) to connect to.
- End-to-End Encrypted
All messages are end-to-end encrypted, only author and intended recipients can see the content.
- Open Source
Both Colla Network client side (i.e. Colla DApp, e.g. CollaChat) and server side (i.e. Colla Node) are free and open source for anyone to download, install, run and build own deployment.

CollaChat supports Web/Mobile/Desktop and Multi-device. It has most popular messaging and social functions:
- Chat (supports text, emoji, voice, photo, video, file, card, supports group chat, supports offline messaging)
- Voice/Video Call (supports group call)
- Collection & Note
- Channel
Moreover, it provides some useful privacy protection functions:
- Message Self-destruction
- Message Recall
- Contact/Chat Lock

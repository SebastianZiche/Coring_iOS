App Promotional Text
Find new friends on the same WiFi network and start chatting immediately! If you, or they, don’t feel like chatting right now, just send them a Spy Message!
App Description
It's very simple to use. Just provide a username and a photo (of yourself preferably), then join any WiFi network and let the app discover other users on the same network. You can either be "Online" or "Offline. You can invite others "Online" users to chat or send them Spy Messages in case they don't feel like chatting rigth now, or you can send Spy Messages to "Offline" users. A Spy Message can contain both text and photo. Spy messages will remain archived until you actually decide to delete them. Remember thought, you are allowed to send a limited number of Spy Messages per user! So think carefully what you want say or show! You can sign in with AppleID, Google or Facebook. Have fun!! - (Only the full version of the App can process Spy Messages.)

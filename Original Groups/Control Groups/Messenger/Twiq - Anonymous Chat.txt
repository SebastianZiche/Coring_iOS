Version 3.0 (Feb 4, 2021)
    We've collected your feedback over the past few months and combined it into this update. Twiq 3.0 includes a brand new feed where you can talk publicly with other users. You can create posts and comments, vote or simply mark your favorite posts. There is also a new coin system. This brings you many advantages. You can use your coins where you like it the most and have, for example, more requests or likes per day than before. If you collect upvotes on your posts or comments, you will even receive additional coins. In addition to the changes mentioned here, we have made many other minor improvements and bug fixes. We hope you like the app even more now and we wish you a lot of fun with it.

App Description
ShazzleChat is the world’s only messaging app that never gets your data. We allow you to send it directly. This means we are currently the only messaging app that gives you true privacy.
Create Your Own Free Privacy Network with ShazzleChat.
TO GET STARTED:
1. Download the ShazzleChat Application.
2. Sign up and create your personal privacy network and enter the SMS verification code.
3. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Invite a friend or family member to join the network! Add more friends and family via "Invite Contacts" if on your device or "Add Contact" if this is a brand new personal contact. Your personal privacy network is lonely without friends and family!
4. Enjoy your personal privacy network.
Viber, WhatsApp, and other services ask you to trust them to delete your messages once they deliver them. You don’t have to trust us. We never get your message. We allow you to deliver it yourself as easily as creating your message and pressing 'send'.
• We do not store your communications because we don’t receive them, ever.
• Our chat and mail products are free to use because privacy should not have a
price.
• You don’t need to trust us. We don’t want you to trust us. Trust is not a fundamental freedom, privacy is.
When Privacy Matters to you and your family - ShazzleChat. When you want to express yourself without ramifications - ShazzleChat. When your job could be effected by your social life - ShazzleChat. When you want to share with your friends and family without the public scrutiny - ShazzleChat.
ShazzleChat connects you with your party or groups and never keeps record of your delivered content and never limits the amount of content you may deliver. We don’t store your memories, they are yours, not ours. Our system is designed to keep us connecting you not recording or profiling you.
Shazzle believes privacy is liberty. We do not store your information because we do not see or store your information. Our system is built to insure this does not happen. Privacy is not about having something to hide, it’s about having something to preserve.
We're always looking to improve our products, including making them more accessible. Please email support@shazzle.com with any comments. Thank you!

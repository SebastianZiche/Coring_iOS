App Description
IMMUNE is an innovative, new messenger with a built-in crypto wallet, a high degree of security and protection for your data. The built-in crypto wallet allows you to easily and quickly transfer to your friends and business partners - sending and receiving bitcoins directly from the chat.

IMMUNE does not store personal correspondence and contacts on its servers, all data remain on your device. All correspondence is protected with end-to-end encryption using strong, proven algorithms (ECIES, AES256).

IMMUNE contains all the usual messenger functions:
Sending text and voice messages
Voice and video calls
Sending and receiving files of any type
Sending and receiving images and videos
Sending and receiving contacts from the address book

The IMMUNE crypto wallet allows you to:
Store bitcoins on the mobile device
Transfer bitcoins to other people by phone number or a wallet address
Restore the wallet using a secret phrase when reinstalling the app or changing the phone number

IMMUNE uses the technology that allows you to connect to your companion directly bypassing intermediate servers, which gives high quality calls without interference and distortion.

IMMUNE is an ad-free application. Just you and your partners in conversation, no annoying banners or pop-up windows.

App Description
MosApp is an instant messaging application that uses end-to-end encryption technology. It focuses on information security and protecting user privacy. The encrypted chat server does not save any information, and anyone outside the conversation cannot read or listen to it. You can safely chat and make audio and video calls with your friends and family. MosApp features include encrypted one-on-one and group chats, channel subscriptions, group chats with up to 10,000 people, burn after reading messages, two-way deletion, read receipts, and app lock screens.

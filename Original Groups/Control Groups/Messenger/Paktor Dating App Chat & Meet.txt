Read me:
>Paktor dating app will be seeking access to your gallery and cache photos in external storage for faster photo retrieval.
>Photo access is to make your profile stand out on our dating app. Successful matches hinge on clear face pics!
>We’ll be seeking location access to connect you with local people nearby for meetups. We’d also like to access your country code; not to skype you, but for a smoother login.
>We’d love to protect our BFF (that’s you and the friends you meet). Violations of terms (like disgustingly trying to hookup, keep asking for private WhatsApp, WeChat & Telegram, etc.) will lead to account termination. We touch hearts, not bodies (not without consent). Keep it pure for real connection.
>We suggest pairing your rizz with an unlimited data plan (or Wi-Fi connection) to avoid additional fees when using cellular data.

App Description
Grapherex is the app with secure messenger, cryptocurrency wallet and many other useful features.



Secure Messenger

It's a really simple and convenient way to send text messages, voice messages, photos, videos, stickers, files and even money. Also you have to know that you use it with end-to-end encryption. Ohh! It means that you can send information highly secure.



Simple & free

You can register simply with your phone number, integrate your contacts book and start messaging straight away.



Call & Video

Voice and video calls take advantage of the same end-to-end encryption that is used for messaging and multimedia sharing. Your voice and video calls are always private and work without the server but on a peer-to-peer basis.



Cryptocurrency wallet

Open a single cryptocurrency wallet to safely store, send and receive crypto currency with Grapherex right on your device. Only you hold the private key and can access your account. Your data and funds are protected by E2E encryption and state-of-art information security technologies.

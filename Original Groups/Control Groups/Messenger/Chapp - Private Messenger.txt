App Description
Chapp is the only secure messenger that allows you to completely balance your work and personal life at the same time, in harmony.
For us, SECURITY means the treatment of your contacts and the exchange of messages between them, therefore we store each user’s contacts and messages locally on their device. Moreover, we use end-to-end ENCRYPTION so that the sender and recipient are sure that their correspondence is SAFE and only they have access to it.
Top-grade security and usability:
• Chapp uses end-to-end encryption to make your messages and media thoroughly secured.
• The keys to decrypt your communication are stored on your and your friends’ devices only, and never on our servers.
• Your contacts are only stored on your device, making it impossible to get to them without your device at hand.
Two profiles:
• With Chapp, you can keep them separate. Two tabs, dubbed “Personal” and “Work”, help you manage all communication in an orderly fashion and manage what information is shared with the two types of contacts, personal and work ones.
P E R S O N A L:
• Communicate with your family and friends in your personal profile, know that work-life does not distract you from the most important communication in the world.
W O R K:
• For the business professional, the most important aspect is to organize and keep the entire business communication in one place.
• In Chapp’s work profile, you can easily communicate with your colleagues, while keeping it in a separate space from all the other communication.
• Chapp’s work profile allows you to improve the quality and efficiency of all business correspondence while keeping it encrypted.

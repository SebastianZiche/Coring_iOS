App Description
Trim Chat, the minimalist messaging app, is designed for short-lived exchanges, without the use of personal contact details like phone number, social media account, or contact list. As messages reach an age threshold, they are automatically deleted. If an inactive chat drops to zero messages, it too is deleted. Always trim, your list of chats contains only those most active and relevant.

FEATURES

Private - no phone number, social media account, contact list, advertising, or tracking

Simple - connect with QR code or expiring link

Secure - end-to-end encryption

Trim - automatic removal of inactive conversations

GET STARTED IN 3 STEPS

1. Enter your name.

2. Create a trim-chat with just a title.

3. Invite others to your trim-chat via QR code or expiring link.

USE CASES

New (untrusted or temporary) contacts - connect without exposing your contact details by scanning a QR code

3rd party coordination - connect your contacts with each other without exposing their contact details by sharing an expiring link

Short-lived topics with your existing contacts - create lightweight, topical trim-chats by sharing an expiring link

App Description
Instantly connect with your loved ones no matter where you are. Pinngle is a secure and fast messaging and calling app that also allows sharing files, photos, videos, and locations. Follow Pinngle public channels to get updates from your favorite bloggers, travelers, influencers, and social activists.



Use Everywhere

Use Pinngle anywhere you go. It works perfectly even in countries where other apps get shut down or blocked.



Feel Protected

Pinngle does not store any of your data on any servers. And all your communication (all your conversations) are end-to-end encrypted, which means no one, not even Pinngle can have access to them.



Enjoy Top Quality

Make crystal-clear voice calls even with a poor Internet connection (2G) and enjoy HD video calls wherever you are.



Keep in Touch

Connect with your family and loved ones, friends, and colleagues the way you want. Use group chats, share files, photos, videos, locations, and spice up your conversations with funny stickers.



Find Cool People

Pinngle Public Channels host a strong community of bloggers, travelers, models, photographers, influencers, and activists. Read their articles, watch their photos and videos, and keep in touch with them.

You can lead a friend to another friend but you cannot make them friends. You can send a friend the number for your favorite pizza place but they still might order pineapple.

We added some reliability improvements to the desktop linking experience. We fixed some screens that were difficult to use on an iPad and the iPhone 4.

Talk about the past without repeating it on your keyboard. Wake up suddenly in the middle of the night and deliver the perfect comeback to a joke from four days ago. We fixed a rare issue where some users could not see their old messages. An updated design gives Signal a fresh new look that still feels familiar. Images and captions are displayed within the same message. We referred to this project as bubble collapse but we think that you ll refer to it as so much better. It s easier to access the dedicated viewer for extremely lengthy messages. We also resolved the issue where long text messages were sometimes partially cropped. Signal s revamped layouts now fully support Dynamic Type. If you have previously adjusted the desired font size in your iOS Settings you no longer have to adjust your expectations. We corrected the lingering views for iPhone X users where content wasn t always visually flowing behind the Home indicator and that s the bottom line . New message sounds will play at the alert volume instead of the media volume within the app. They say that you only get one chance to make a first impression but we re really hoping that s not true because the Signal logo was sometimes slightly misaligned on the initial launch screen in previous releases. We fixed an issue that would prevent the app from opening after receiving a malformed message. Thanks to Michael Straßburger for reporting this bug. Assorted stability enhancements and bug fixes.

These bugs were discovered internally and also reported by Adam Cianflone and Justin Davis. Previously: Unlock Signal s screen without lifting a finger from the Touch ID sensor that is now optionally supported : Signal Settings Privacy Screen Lock. Have a staring contest with your iPhone X and win . The infrared Face ID camera always blinks first and Signal supports that too. You can stop watching a boring video before it ends without occasionally crashing Signal. If it s an eleven minute video just wait at least that long before responding so your friend thinks that you watched the whole thing. Explore a virtual museum of memories in any conversation with the new All Media view then ruthlessly curate your virtual museum with the raw power of batch delete. Use gestures to quickly scroll through images and videos. Signal supports left and right swipes because the carousel of life moves in both directions.

We resolved another issue that caused profile pictures to flicker. If this was happening to the profile picture of someone you love hopefully now they can be a solid presence in your life and in Signal. Some rare background crash scenarios would cause Signal to forget about in progress draft messages and to launch more slowly during multitasking. Like all good backgrounds these crashes are now behind us.

Select from a variety of audio options for your Signal notifications. You can also pick a unique message tone for your favorite conversations. Signal s notification settings were simplified. There s now a unified option to control what appears in your notifications for both messages and calls. We made some performance improvements to the way that calls are connected. Even if you speak slowly you can start talking faster.

We also fixed a couple of rare crashes and are now correctly syncing a group s disappearing message status to Signal Desktop. New in 2.20.0 Now you can share content with Signal from other applications. Send someone a great picture from Photos the perfect link from Safari or a song from your favorite streaming app. Share without any insecurity. This feeling of confidence was inside you the whole time. Add captions to your attachments before you send them. The best attachments are the ones that require an explanation. Improved audio handling means that Signal will automatically resume playing your music after you place a call play a voice note or view a video message. Send full size images without any additional compression by tapping on the attachment icon selecting Document and choosing Photo Library. Send your friend an enormous high resolution file that definitively proves to them that it wasn t just some random guy in the park and was actually a long distance Tom Hanks photobomb. Enable and disable Disappearing Messages using a new stopwatch icon. Searching for contacts in the compose screen also searches profile names. Signal launches faster than ever and uses the latest version of WebRTC for improved call performance. Swiping to get back to the inbox from a conversation thread is so much easier. The list of supported languages has expanded to include Traditional Chinese and Estonian. We sincerely appreciate the volunteer translators whose efforts made this possible. We said farewell to the following bugs: Tapping on images in the media view would sometimes cause them to move around a bit before the navigation bars disappeared. Images now remain frozen in place as the glorious darkness of the full screen media view surrounds them. The initial hourglass rendering that is displayed underneath each Disappearing Message had a pixel that was out of place. Even when they re only tiny dots on a screen every single grain of sand is important. The VoiceOver accessibility feature in iOS no longer stops working after recording a voice memo. Real people don t flicker. Now the profile avatars that represent those people don t flicker either. Signal calls that are placed on speakerphone from the lock screen will now correctly indicate that the speakerphone is active in the app as well. A rare issue could occur with the disappearing message timer on a newly linked Signal Desktop device but that s not the world we live in anymore. Messages would sometimes disappear if you were looking at the info screen when a read receipt arrived. The app would become unresponsive if you tried to send a photo after denying Signal access to your photo library. Some characters that used to look strange in lock screen notifications now look totally normal. You d never even suspect that anything about them is different. If you killed the app at precisely the right moment you might find yourself unable to message certain users. This game of chance was difficult to play and the victory prize wasn t very fun so we decided to get rid of it. Signal is made for you. Thank you for your feedback and support. We are hiring.

Adjacent message statuses behaved incorrectly after deleting a message. Users who were simultaneously running the desktop version of Signal could receive redundant notifications. Edit items might be missing from the long press menu. The input toolbar could remain raised even when no keyboard was visible. Recently sent messages sometimes reappeared after being deleted.

App Description
Skred is the first secure peer-to-peer instant messaging app - No need for an email address or phone number to use it.

Skred is free, without subscription, without a provider, without a SIM card, and without leaving a trace.

Skred is developed based on privacy-by-design and leverages the highest levels of authorization encryption. Skred enables an anonymous, unique and secure connection with each of your contacts. Only the two participants in a call can communicate with each other excluding anyone else.
With an interface that is easy to use without impacting the learning experience, Skred enables easy exchange of messages, images, videos, voice calls and video calls.

The SkredBoard, which is accessible by simply swiping down, allows for generating many identities that are separated from each other for absolute confidentiality. You can also use groups to exchange with several friends at once.

When you delete a message on Skred, it also disappears from the mobile phone of your caller.

All exchanges are encrypted from start to finish, from mobile to mobile. They are not stored on any server. The encryption technologies are open source and based on the work of hackers and hacktivists of the Guardian Project.

Skred originated from the Skyrock Group, which in turn came from the free radio movement in France. It defends freedom of expression on the air and on the internet.

With Skred, you are free!

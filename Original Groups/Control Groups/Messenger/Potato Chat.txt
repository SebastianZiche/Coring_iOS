App Description
Potato is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security. It’s superfast, simple, secure and free.

You can send an unlimited amount of messages, photos, videos and files of any type (.doc, .zip, .pdf, etc.). Potato groups have up to 200000 members and you can create channels to broadcast messages to an unlimited number of subscribers.

We built Potato to make messaging speedy and safe again, without the usual caveats.

Why Switch to Potato?

FAST: Potato is the fastest messaging app on the market because it uses a distributed infrastructure with data centers positioned around the globe to connect users to the closest possible server.

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security among mass messengers. Potato is based on time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.

CLOUD STORAGE: Potato seamlessly syncs across all your devices, so you can always securely access your data. Your message history is stored for free in the Potato cloud. Never lose your data again!

GROUP CHAT & SHARING: With Potato, you can form large group chats and broadcast lists of up to 200000 members, quickly share large videos, documents (.doc, .ppt, .zip, etc.), and send an unlimited amount of photos to your friends.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Potato is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.


PRIVACY: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Potato offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

SUPPORT: For real-time support, please go to Settings in Potato and select “Ask a Question” to send a message directly to our support volunteers.

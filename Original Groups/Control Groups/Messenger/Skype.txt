From the new baby to the latest sales figures, Skype makes sharing our big news better. Anyone can start calling, texting, and video-conferencing—or even dialing landlines—thanks to the intuitive design. With zillions of Skype users to connect to, it’s one of the most useful apps on our iPhone and Apple Watch.
App Description
Skype – Connect, Create, Talk & Discover, now with Bing GPT-4



SKYPE WITH MICROSOFT BING, POWERED BY GPT-4

Ask Bing 1:1 or in any group chat:

- Help me plan a trip to Europe this summer

- Write a dad joke and translate it into any language

- Ask for movie recommendations

- Unleash your creativity

Skype is now integrated with Bing, cutting-edge AI-powered copilot, the latest generative language model from OpenAI that you can use for free. With ChatGPT in Skype, you don’t need any technical knowledge, just ask a question like you would a friend.

Bonus points: Try asking ChatGPT in your native language and find the most interesting question to ask!

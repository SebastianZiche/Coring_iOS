App Description
Rakuten Viber is a secure, fun, and exciting messaging and calling app, connecting over a billion people worldwide!

You can do it all with Rakuten Viber: group chats, disappearing messages, reminders, and more:

Send messages for free
Staying in touch has never been easier. Send a free text, photo, sticker, GIF, voice or video message, along with many other types of files.

Make free audio and video calls
Enjoy unlimited Viber-to-Viber calls to anyone in the world for free. You can even call up to 60 people at the same time! Great for connecting with friends, family, and colleagues :)

Experience end-to-end encryption
On by default for all 1-on-1 calls, chats, and group chats, end-to-end encryption allows to you to communicate with confidence knowing that all messages will remain private. No one, not even Rakuten Viber, can read your messages.

Make low-cost calls to landlines with Viber Out
Call any landline or mobile phone with Viber Out’s low-cost international calling service. Get a Viber Out subscription to call a specific destination or keep your options open and buy minutes to call anywhere in the world.

Open a group chat
Catch up with friends, family, and colleagues by opening a group chat for up to 250 members. Use polls and quizzes, @mentions and reactions to get the most out of your group!

Express yourself with lenses, GIFs, and stickers
Personalize your chats! Get creative with fun, funny, and beautifying Viber lenses. GIFs and over 55,000 stickers also await you - you can even create your own.

Use disappearing messages
Send disappearing messages in your 1-on-1 and group chats by setting a timer for each message. You can choose how long the message will be available after it’s opened - 10 seconds, 1 minute, or up to 1 day!

Connect in Communities and Channels
Whether it's sports, news, cooking, travel or entertainment, get the content you really want and connect with others with similar interests. You can even start your own Community or Channel and gain a global following.

Chat with AI bots
Rakuten Viber's AI bots will answer all your questions and turn your words into beautiful art. You can also find verified bots to get the latest news on fashion, book your travel, and even pay your electricity bills!

React to messages
React to messages with emojis to express exactly how you feel in chats!

Create notes and reminders
Forward interesting messages, keep meaningful links, and add your thoughts to your notes. You can also set reminders to ensure you never forget important tasks and events.

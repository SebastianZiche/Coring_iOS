OVERVIEW

Our users are protected—free from worry of prying eyes, data mining, sketchy hackers, and the paranoia that your words could come back to haunt you—freedom for everything that makes you, YOU.

ENCRYPTED MESSENGER
For everyday texting and sharing photos with friends, family and colleagues, or exchanging more sensitive information such as credit cards, social security numbers, bank information, wire transfer instructions, passwords, or medical records – CYBER DUST is the most secure private texting & messaging application.

1) Unsend any message, anytime
2) Detects and notifies you if a screenshot is taken
3) Automatically erases history after 24 hours

Rest assured knowing CYBER DUST conversations are heavily encrypted and not accessible by anyone, not even us. You can even erase messages off THEIR phone in real-time. Once a message is deleted on CYBER DUST it can never be recovered, period. Send secret texts.

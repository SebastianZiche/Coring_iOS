App Description
Tickmate allows you to track any daily occurrences. It is a is a 1-bit journal, meaning each day is either ticked or not. You can track anything from habits you wish to build or break to how often you wash your hair.

Use a "reversed" track for occurrences you don't want to happen, so they're automatically ticked unless you untick them.

You can use the "allow multiple" feature to be able to tick a single day multiple times.

There are 3 sizes of customizable widgets to add to your Home Screen or Today View.

Unlock the premium groups feature to swipe between different sets of tracks, perfect to separate daily tasks from occasional occurrences.

With iCloud sync, all your data will be securely synced across all devices.

This app is free and open-source. Its source code can be viewed on GitHub through the App Support link.

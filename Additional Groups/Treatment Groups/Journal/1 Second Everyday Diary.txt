"For over 10 years, I’ve been recording 1 second every day, so I’ll never forget another day ever again. This project had such a positive impact on my day-to-day life after a few months, that I dedicated my life to making a mobile app which would make it easy for anyone to do this too. Being able to relive every single day has provided me with a treasured perspective on life. It holds me accountable for making each day notable. When I turned 40, I had a 1-hour movie that encapsulated my 30s. If I live to see 80 years of age, I’ll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life."

- Cesar Kuriyama, 1SE Founder

    Crowds has been a long time in the making, and it’s always been part of our dream to provide users with a safe, private way to share their experiences with the people they’re close to. Crowds is completely free, and does not interfere with or replace any existing 1SE functionality - it’s our New Year’s gift to everyone.

    *Improvements*

    - Photos and videos hidden in the photos app will no longer appear in the 1SE library

Version 4.3.1 (Aug 5, 2021)
    Because we can’t, and we won’t, and we don’t stop! We’re super stoked to fill you in on all of the cool things that we’ve been working on. This version is jam-packed with goodies.

    *NEW*

    - You can now fill in captions using locations from your videos! Those of you who have been around for a long time will remember this one. Now it’s back and better than ever because you can search for and list nearby places, or even use your current location instead of the one on your video.

    - Smart Fill is here! It’s our brand new, completely overhauled, and supercharged version of Auto-fill! Smart Fill is a great way to easily choose snippets for you and now it’s even better, with a full-screen player that lets you swipe through each snippet and even make edits and tweaks right there so you don’t have to go edit things later to get the exact, perfect moment.

    - Introducing Themed Challenges! It’s a new way to get involved in the 1SE community, and also act as a prompt if you want a little help with ideas of things to record. If you’re an old-school 1SE-er then think of this as our new take on Crowds.

    - Rewind Wednesday notifications can let you know when you have something to look back and reflect on, every week. If you love them and want them every day then you can do that too!

    - New, unified notification settings screen that lets you choose whether you want notifications for Freestyle Collabs, daily reminders, Themes, or Rewind. You can even pause them all at once if you just need a break for a little while.

    - Your regular albums from the Photos app now show up when you’re adding a snippet to make it easier to find the things you’re looking for. And there’s a new setting that lets you choose if you want to include media from shared albums or not. If you have a lot of duplicates and don’t like seeing them, then this is the setting for you!

    *FIXED*

    - When you add a snippet using ‘Add from this day,’ the spinner will disappear afterwards. We appreciate you little spinner, but enough is enough—thanks.

    - You may have been wondering why you couldn’t customize reminder messages. We were wondering the same thing so we fixed it.

    We would love to hear any and all feedback. Look for Contact Support and Request a Feature in the settings screen in the app to send your questions, ideas, or words of encouragement. Happy to help.

Version 4.2.5 (Jul 17, 2021)
    Did you find the easter egg we added a couple of months ago? If you need a clue let’s just say that even more of you should stumble upon it in the *near future*. Alright, on to the changes. This is a bug fix release which may sound boring but who doesn’t like it when things just work better?!

    *NEW*

    - Thumbnails of your private snippets are now blurred everywhere, and we really mean everywhere!

    - Hopefully you like those context menus we added on snippets in Journal projects and Freestyle Collabs, because we brought them all over to Freestyle projects as well.

    *FIXED*

    - This stuff is hard to describe in words but if you tried to rotate and then flip a snippet and it didn’t do what you expected, especially if you zoomed in, give it another go. We think you’ll be happy with the results!

    - The volume of videos in 1SE now matches what you hear in the Photos app, instead of being louder. Your volume settings will better reflect what you’ll hear in other apps when you share your mashed movies.

    - There are a handful of little improvements and fixes, like hiding the spinner after you edit snippets in a freestyle project, making sure the calendar and day screens agree about your available videos, and scrolling to the bottom of Freestyle Collabs when you open them.

    - We also made a bunch of tweaks to colors for light and dark mode.

    - We fixed a handful of crashes in the media picker, calendar day, and Freestyle screens.

    We would love to hear any and all feedback. Look for Contact Support and Request a Feature in the settings screen in the app to send your questions, ideas, or words of encouragement. Happy to help.

Version 4.2.3 (Apr 12, 2021)
    Hang on because this is an epic release! Are you ready? *takes a deep breath*

    *NEW*

    - HDR support is here! If your device can record in HDR your videos will be in glorious HDR in the app. (Note that if you switch to a different phone it may not be able to properly display HDR videos)

    - We’ve added a mirror option so you can make your selfie snippets look exactly how you like it! You can now flip your snippets horizontally if that’s your kind of thing.

    - If you use your phone in light mode then you might be excited to hear that we now have light and dark modes! By default it switches based on your system’s setting and if you want to override that you can choose to always have it in light or dark mode.

    - Now you can edit photos just like you edit videos, with brightness, rotation, and cropping to fit the frame!

    - We added context menus all over the place so you can tap and hold on days and snippets to quickly do things like auto-fill a single day or copy a snippet to other projects.

    - We freshened up the font and positioning of dates and captions on your videos.

    - There’s one more thing that you might find if you dig around a bit...

    *FIXED*

    - We squashed a bug that was causing some people to get stuck while mashing.

    - Freestyle Collab mashes now obey the laws of causality, and the videos will always play in the correct order.

    - If you switch away from 1SE and back again, the app should now be waiting for you, just as you left it. Instead of, you know, crashing in the background.

    We would love to hear any and all feedback. Look for Contact Support and Request a Feature in the settings screen in the app to send your questions, ideas, or words of encouragement. Happy to help.

    We live and die by reviews - your reviews. If we've provided a great experience and helped you live a better life, please give us a 5-star review and let others know how awesome 1SE is!

Version 4.0.2 (Dec 7, 2020)
    Happy December folks! Can you believe this year is almost over? We've mainly been squashing bugs and tightening screws with this release but here are the main changes:

    - We revamped the profile and account management screens to make it quicker and more intuitive. We’ve also generally refreshed the look for a sleeker design (if we do say so ourselves.)

    - We changed the thumbnail images for your journal projects on the home screen to show the most recent snippet instead of the oldest.

    - Shared GIFs now loop properly - sorry about that!

    - After restoring from a backup or when first updating to version 4.0 your projects will show up in a more sensible order.

    - We have finally found a solution for the iCloud shared album issue. This has been a long time coming—we appreciate your patience as we worked hard on fixing this issue!

    - We’ve added a possible fix for people being randomly signed out. Please reach out if you notice this happening.

    - A number of design tweaks and bug fixes to make your app experience even better!

Version 4.0.1 (Oct 22, 2020)
    Collaboration is here!

    - There’s a new kind of project in town; Freestyle Collaboration! Along with your classic journal and freestyle, you can now create collaborative mashes with your friends and family. You must have a Pro account to create a freestyle collaboration, but anyone can join it!

    A whole new look and feel!

    - The app has had a few makeovers in its lifetime, but this might be our favorite to date. Not only did we update the projects menu with individual cards for each of your projects, but we’ve updated fonts and colors and smoothed out the interface to be the sleekest and prettiest version ever, if we do say so ourselves. We hope you like it!

    ... and more!

    - Streamline adding a new snippet when you only want to add it to one project.

    - Many bug fixes and small improvements.

    • Private snippets! Mark your snippets as private so that they're excluded from your mashed movies unless you explicitly include them. This makes it easy to include private moments in your timeline that you may not want to mash and share with others.

    • New custom mashing! There's now a totally new way to make mashes even more customizable. You can select and deselect months at a time, and you can even tap on individual snippets to include or exclude them! Combined with private snippets, it's easier and faster than ever to mash specific movies, like someone's birthday over the years or all the snippets with your dog from the last few weeks.

    Fixes:

    • We made sharing snippets faster, and way less likely to crash on older phones.

    • Fixed the Pro link from our website.

    • Fixed an issue allowing the same snippet to be added to a mashed video multiple times

    • Nixed a crash that some users experienced during mashing

    • It's now possible to submit debug logs when you're not using the default Mail app

    • The camera will stop bugging you for location access

    • We fixed a bug where your videos that were recorded today wouldn't show up in 1SE until you relaunched the app.

    • The calendar is even faster at showing which days have videos available on them now!

    We would love to hear any and all feedback. Please email your questions, ideas, or words of encouragement to support@1secondeveryday.com, or look for Contact Support and Request a Feature in the settings screen in the app. Happy to help.

    We live and die by reviews, your reviews. If we've provided a great experience and helped you live a better life, please give us a 5-star review and let others know how awesome 1SE is!

    • You can now sign in with Apple on iOS 13! Much easier and streamlined!

    We have a few fixes and some changes for new folks in 3.2.1:

    • Free accounts now get 1 year's worth of their snippets backed up for free!

    • The mash button now lives front and center, so you can watch your movie from almost anywhere, at any time.

    • We’ve made it even easier to get started and catch up! There are some new hints on how to get started when you're looking at an empty calendar.

    • Instead of asking for all permissions upfront, we now just ask for them when they're needed. That way, you know why we're asking for them, and if you don't use certain features, you won't be bugged about it!

    • When you contact support in the app, it no longer sends an email but shows your support conversations right in the app. We hope that it makes getting help from us even easier!

    • You can now request a feature in the settings screens so if you have ideas, feel free to send them our way.

    We have some exciting updates for this version:

    • You can now create and share vertical videos!

    • Pro members, you now have the option to remove the dates to your mashed videos.

    • We disabled screen auto-lock while mashing, so the phone doesn't go to sleep and cancel your video.

    • We made backing up, restoring, and cutting snippets a lot faster all while using half the data. Changing captions/locations (and dates in freestyles) is now much quicker as well!

    • We updated reminder notifications so if you've already added a snippet for the day, you won't get a new reminder.

    • We fixed a bug where your current streak could be broken by the recent daylight savings time change.

Version 3.1.3 (Aug 29, 2019)

    • You can now back up even if you only use Freestyle! Pro subscribers weren’t able to turn on backup if they only had freestyle projects—a bit odd but it’s all good now!

    • We fixed a fairly rare crash that could happen when you’re swiping around between days. Swipe away!

    • We’ve combined your video library and in-app camera by adding the ability to swipe back and forth with ease.

    • We’ve re-edited our Tutorial videos to reflect the vertical interface. Those are located in your Settings under the ‘Support’ section.

    Just a couple of changes in this one:

Version 3.0.1 (Mar 12, 2019)
    3.0.1 has a few small changes and bug fixes:

    A few changes and additions in this version:

Version 2.1.3 (Oct 23, 2018)
    We have a few fixes for you in this version:

    • Restoring from a backup wasn't working for some of you, and was even crashing in some cases. We're sorry about that and this version should sort it all out.

    • You may have noticed some phantom snippets appear after replacing or deleting a snippet in a day. That won't happen anymore, and you shouldn't see them again. Ever.

Version 2.1.2 (Oct 2, 2018)
    We have a few fixes for you in this version:

    • We are now optimized for the new, awesomely gigantic iPhone XS Max screen!

    • You may have noticed some phantom snippets appear after replacing or deleting a snippet in a day. That won't happen anymore, and you shouldn't see them again. Ever.

    • If you signed up for an account and are backing up now, you may have noticed that it didn't look like every snippet was being backed up. That was because of those pesky phantom snippets and is also fixed now.

    • Deleting projects didn't work properly, so we made it work because that was kind of embarrassing. But we didn't stop there! It was a little slow, so we also made it a lot faster!

    • When recording with the camera in 1SE, you may have ended up with videos that didn't fill the entire screen with a pleasant 16:9 aspect ratio. Surprise! We fixed that too! You should always get 16:9 recordings with our camera now.

    • We made it a bit faster and smoother to scrub around when you're cutting a snippet.

    And, of course, everything from 2.1:

    And of course it includes all the great, new features in 2.0:

    ** NEW **

    • Two separate snippets per day! Some days just have so much going on, so we've updated our timeline project to allow two separate snippets in one day!

    • Rotate & Zoom! You asked we listened (finally). Pesky vertical videos? Begone! Lopsided videos ruining your mash? No more! You can now rotate and zoom to your heart's content.

    • Mood Tracking! There are so many ways to remember your day. We added journaling earlier this year, and now we're continuing to expand it with a mood tracking feature!

    • New look! We put a new coat of paint on most of the app, and it's looking pretty sweet if we say so ourselves!

    • Favorite your snippets! You can favorite snippets (with the star button) and then choose to mash only your faves.

    • Albums! You have a bunch of albums in the Photos app, and now you can use them to pick videos (and photos) to put in 1SE. That means you can also use media from iCloud shared albums now.

    • Reminder badge! There's a setting you can turn on to put a red (1) badge on the 1SE app icon when you forget to record a snippet one day.

    • iPhone X support! Full screen baby!

    This is a big one! Version 2 is here, and we have touched almost every corner of the app. Multiple seconds per day, rotate and zoom, mood tracking, improved journal, faves, and a brand new look that supports the iPhone X! We've worked really hard on this update and hope that you love it!

    ** NEW **

    • Two seconds per day! Some days just have so much going on, so we've updated our timeline project to allow two separate seconds in one day!

    • Rotate & Zoom! You asked we listened (finally). Pesky vertical videos? Begone! Lopsided videos ruining your mash? No more! You can now rotate and zoom to your heart's content.

    • Mood Tracking! There are so many ways to remember your day. We added journaling earlier this year, and now we're continuing to expand it with a mood tracking feature!

    • New look! We put a new coat of paint on most of the app, and it's looking pretty sweet if we say so ourselves!

    • Favorite your seconds! You can favorite seconds (with the star button) and then choose to mash only your faves.

    • Albums! You have a bunch of albums in the Photos app, and now you can use them to pick videos (and photos) to put in 1SE. That means you can also use media from iCloud shared albums now.

    • Reminder badge! There's a setting you can turn on to put a red (1) badge on the 1SE app icon when you forget to record a snippet one day.

    • iPhone X support! Full screen baby!

    • Many other little improvements and fixes here and there.

    We live and die by reviews, your reviews. If we've provided a great experience and helped you live a better life, please give us a 5-star review and let others know how awesome 1SE is!

Version 1.70000.4 (Nov 21, 2017)
    We fixed a few more bugs. Original release notes for version 1.70000 are below:

    Hold on to your butts! This is a pretty hefty update. First and foremost we've fixed a bunch of bugs for all of you intrepid iOS 11 folks. Thanks for bearing with us. We also added new journal editor when you tap into a day (we called this the diary before but it's the same deal).

    One change to note is that we are doing some housekeeping and no longer show mashed movies in 1SE. But fear not! They are always available in the 1SE album in your Photos app, where you have access to more editing and sharing features.

    ** NEW **

    • Added new mashing presets so you can easily mash a season. When you tap the play button to mash a video choose Presets on the left, then tap Seasons in the middle, and pick a season on the right.

    • There's a way to automatically fill in all of the visible the orange days in your timeline! Tap the purple magic wand button next to the mash button in the bottom right corner. You can choose to keep or discard the generate snippets so there's no risk, and you can try it again to get different choices. This is really cool and we think you'll like it a lot. (If you already found this by shaking your phone, thanks for helping us test it out)

    • You can choose to automatically add location names to new snippets for each project instead of it being all-or-nothing. The default setting is still the same where you get locations in freestyle projects, and don't get them in timelines. Go into the project list and hit the little edit pencil icon by a project title to change this option for existing projects.


    ** IMPROVED **

    • When you're recording a snippet with 1SE and leave the app or get interrupted by, say, a phone call, your video is saved to your photo library immediately so it doesn't get lost.

    • Save looping snippet videos to your photo library with one tap.

    • Added a button to share mashed movies with Messages.

    • If you select a lot of snippets really fast in a row you may have seen the mysterious message "Unknown error 6: Cannot Decode", or other weird things happen. Now things should work more smoothly, you just may have to be a bit patient and wait for your phone to catch up if you go really fast. We recommend getting a nice beverage and taking a few more seconds to choose your hand-crafted, artisanal, gluten-free snippets. But if you want to speed through it that should be better now. (Hi Dave!)

    • The scroll, the scroll, the buttons, the buttons. Scrollin' so smooth like the butter on a muffin.


    ** FIXED **

    • Recorded videos work properly when your phone is locked in portrait orientation on iOS 11.

    • Mashed movies had some problems with audio going out of sync when shared to Facebook, and video corruption when sent to a Mac or PC and opened in VLC and other video apps. Thankfully this should no longer be the case. Share my friends, share!

    • A few of you had thumbnails disappear. They should reappear in this version, and we regret the error. Those responsible have been sacked. (not really :)

    • The app handles long project titles way better.

    • Vanquished some crashing bugs.

Version 1.70000.3 (Nov 14, 2017)
    We fixed a few bugs in version 1.70000.3:

    • Include the last day when selecting snippets for a custom mash.

    • InstaMashing your top 30 Instagram posts actually mashes the top 30 instead of the whole year.

    • Recommend a silly work-around when we can't fetch a video from iCloud but there's no error. If you go kickstart the Photos app then it starts working again. Super weird.

    • Maybe fix a rare crashing bug. Fingers crossed!

    Original release notes for version 1.70000 are below.

Version 1.70000.2 (Oct 24, 2017)
    We fixed a few bugs in version 1.70000.2:

    • No more missing orange days just because you have Launch to Camera turned on.

    • If you saw reminders from categories you turned off or no reminders at all, that should all work properly now.

    • No more missing dates when replacing freestyle snippets!

    • When selecting snippets for a custom mash, the selected snippets are now properly highlighted.

    • Fixed a handful of crashes: moving snippets in a freestyle project, changing reminders options, and more! Super exciting stuff.

    • Some rare crashing bugs.

    • We fixed a confusing error message when mashing a movie failed. It said you didn't have enough space but you did. We regret the error. If you hit this error you can try renaming or deleting your 1SE album in the photos app and then try again. (It might be a smart album!)

Version 1.60000.1 (May 15, 2017)
    This version mainly fixes bugs, including some crashers. If you tried to use 1SE with a calendar that isn't the Gregorian calendar and only saw one day in the calendar view, rejoice! That bug is fixed and you can use the app no matter what your system calendar is set to. (The app still only uses the Gregorian calendar)

    One new thing is a setting to disable the snippet sharing screen that shows up automatically when you create your first snippet in each session. It's under Advanced Settings near the bottom of the menu.

    And of course it includes all the changes from version 1.60000:

    ----

    ** NEW **

    • Shake your phone to fill in orange days automatically! When you're looking at orange days in your timeline just shake your phone to try it out. If you don't like what you see then shake your phone to try again, or tap "Discard" to throw them out. We'll choose different snippets every time.

    • We introduced Insta-Mash in December to let you mash your last year on Instagram. Now you have many more options for making those videos, just like mashing a movie from your 1SE snippets.

    • There's an advanced setting for 60 FPS videos, supported throughout the entire app from recording, to cutting snippets, to mashing. Note that this may make your snippets and mashed movies take up more space.

    • The options screen has been overhauled to be less of an eyesore. Hooray!


    ** IMPROVED **

    • We categorized our reminder messages and you can choose the categories you want to see! Don't like our reminders? Set a custom message that says anything you want. Boom.

    • Oh, and you can choose a specific time at which to receive reminders too.

    • Thumbnails always fill days in your timeline now. No more black bars on thumbnails of vertical videos. (Your actual snippets will still be vertical, fear not!)


    ** FIXED **

    • Sometimes the camera wasn't recording audio properly. No longer.

    • It looks like we were transporting a bunch of people to the great state of Texas by mistake. While warm and full of BBQ, not everyone was pumped. Sorry about that! We fixed it.

    • We fixed some problems uploading mashed movies to Twitter.

Version 1.60000 (Apr 10, 2017)
    Shake your phone to fill in orange days automatically! It's so cool. We also polished up Insta-Mash and added a bunch of new options for you to make videos out of your Instagram posts! As usual we also fixed bugs and made things faster and better in general. Oh and for those of you who don't like seeing banners about Crowds, tips, and 1SE in general you can now turn those off in the new options screen.

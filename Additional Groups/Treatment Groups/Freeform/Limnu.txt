App Description
Limnu is a collaborative online whiteboard made to be fast and simple enough to use for online meetings and video conferences. With Limnu, you can draw, plan, and think at the same time with other people. Make as many boards as you want, as big as you want, see your boards from anywhere, and all your work is automatically archived. Never again will you have to write "DO NOT ERASE" on your whiteboard. Its as fast and simple as a real whiteboard, and it even looks like a real whiteboard.

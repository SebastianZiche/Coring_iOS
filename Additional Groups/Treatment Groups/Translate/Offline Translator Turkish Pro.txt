App Description
OFFLINE translator and dictionary -- the ultimate foreign language tool when you are abroad! Translates text between English and Turkish. Save on data roaming charges when you travel!
The application translates WITHOUT 3G/wi-fi.

Our unique translation technology often delivers translations that excel both Google Translate and Microsoft Translator while using much less storage space.
It also allows more language pairs than other paid apps having offline translation such as iTranslate.

For other languages see 7-in-1 Offline Translator.

TRANSLATION

- full-text translation without any internet connection;

PHOTO/PICTURE TRANSLATION AND OCR

- available for both English and Turkish;
- use this feature to easily convert photos of printed text into editable text in offline mode; 

VOICE / SPEECH
- voice / speech output for English and Turkish (*);
- allows reading individual words by tapping the desired word in the translation;

DICTIONARY 
- dictionary between English and Turkish; 
- recognizes any word form and identifies its features (number, person, gender, etc.) 
- displays all the translations for a given word; 
- displayed for single words when hitting the Translate button; 

You can test the translation without buying the app at the SkyCode Ltd. Web Site (click the Developer Web Site button). For other language pairs check out 7-in-1 Offline Translator.

App Description
Track your mood, energy, feelings, and events with Mind Tracker. Make notes and determine how different events affect your well-being, when you're in your best state, and when your mood declines. The app will clearly show what influences your well-being in the moment and in the future.

1. **Mark your mood**: Keeping a journal has therapeutic effects on its own, record your mood to better understand your emotions and track your well-being in time.
2. **Monitor your energy**: It's essential to track not only your mood but also your energy levels. Remember that your energy level is directly related to your mood.
3. **Analyze the data**: Keep in mind that bad moments in your life are just points on a chart. Look objectively at the overall picture without cognitive distortions, using statistics to analyze your mood diary.
4. **Evaluate the impact of events**: Mark events, and the app will automatically suggest which events have the most significant impact on your well-being and future mood.
5. **Use neurospheres**: Apply an innovative approach to monitoring emotions with neurospheres for a more mindful attitude towards your emotional life.
6. **Keep an eye on the calendar**: Determine mood cycles using a calendar and leave notes about your experiences.
7. **Receive smart recommendations**: Use the smart recommendation system to improve your well-being and emotional state.
8. **Make notes**: Taking notes helps you better understand your experiences and look at them from a different perspective.
9. **Protect your privacy**: We guarantee the security and privacy of your data using modern encryption methods and a strict privacy policy.
10. **Collaborate with your treating specialist**: Use the app in conjunction with your treating specialist, allowing them to more effectively adjust therapy based on the data.

Turn your smartphone into an emotion tracker and mood diary with Mind Tracker to better cope with difficulties and lead a more mindful emotional life.

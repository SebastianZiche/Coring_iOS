■ Pictures can be inserted into sentences (up to 10)
Like a blog, you can insert images between sentences. You can also paste photos taken from the camera roll, images saved by WEB, etc.

■ Secure Passcode Lock
You can lock the app with a password, so if you do not want to be seen by people, you can lock it securely. Of course, it corresponds also to Face ID, Touch ID.

■ Change the theme color
There are 19 theme colors, so you can dress it into a cute theme or cool theme. You can change not only the design of the app but also the icon of the app to put on the home screen. It is a unique feature of this app equipped with latest functions. (It is necessary to make iOS the latest version)

■ Data backup
You can back up important diary data. You can also save it to iTunes or PC, but you can also transfer the diary data to another app (eg Evernote, Dropbox etc). RTFD file can be output, so you can save it carefully.

■ Tag search
Diary search function is attached, you can conveniently search diary by filling in tag. You can easily search many diaries with your favorite words.

■ Adjust character font
You can also reduce or enlarge the size of the texts, you can also adjust the color depth and spacing between texts.
It is nice because you can make it big font size for people who can not read texts well.

■ Reminder function
If you set the time to your liking, the app will do the push notification! You can prevent forgetting to write a diary.

■ You can write a diary many times a day
A single diary a day is also good, but you can write many diaries on a day like a memo or a work record.

■ Advertisement non-display (In App Purchase)

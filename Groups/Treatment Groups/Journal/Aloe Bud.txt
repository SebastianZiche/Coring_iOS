App Promotional Text
Aloe Bud brings awareness to activities-of-daily-life by sending encouraging push notifications, check-ins, and reflections. Reminders from yourself, to your future self.
App Description
Aloe Bud is your self-care companion. It is not meant to and should not replace mental health care or the support of loved ones, but it is a valuable—and free—tool to help bridge gaps in making self-care as accessible and personal as possible. Aloe Bud gently brings awareness to activities of daily life, using encouraging push notifications, rather than guilt or shame.

Whether you're trying to stay hydrated, or need reminders to reconnect with loved ones. Check in and reflect on yourself in real-time or whenever you need. Aloe Bud should feel casual, yet play an important role in your life. Celebrate tiny victories in your personal activity log, which can be accessed when you touch the icon at the top. Scroll through recently completed check in’s and reflections and look back on your progress day by day. Aloe Bud sends reminders ONLY when you add them, and can be set at specific times from daily to weekdays, weekends, or any other arrangement you can think of.

If you would like to enhance your experience and help support our growth, we offer in-app purchases. They allow you to add as many self-care activities, check in’s, journal, and activity log entries, as well as unlimited customization reminder schedules.

Designed out of the pure necessity of their own mental health journey; Aloe Bud creator Serenity Discko searched the App Store for something, anything to help with their basic self-care. After trying and ignoring countless self-care apps and feeling guilty for doing so, finding one that met her needs and lifestyle became frustrating. They believed there was no better time to start designing a gentle, all-in-one self care app, using their own experiences, affinity for pixel art, and the needs of their community to bring this simple idea to life.

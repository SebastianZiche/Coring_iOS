Version 1.0.3 (Apr 16, 2023)
    Journaling is so much more than just recording the day. It's the act of documenting the journey that is you. To help you do this better, we've added some cool new features:

    - Context is now carried from journal entry to journal entry. If you write about something that's relevant to the future, you might be asked about it in that future.
    - You can set reminders for yourself to journal. Check it out in the settings screen and slide on the time to change it.
    - Getting in touch with us is easier than ever before with feedback options in both the app settings, and the options under each entry.

    Enjoy the journey!

App Description
We are the diary app that helps you capture your thoughts and feelings every day. Our unique feature is to ask you a daily question that inspires you to reflect on your experiences and emotions.

Whether you want to record your life, reduce stress, or simply reflect, 365 & me provides the perfect platform. With a user-friendly interface and a variety of questions from different categories such as relationships, career, health, and personal growth, your daily writing routine will never be boring.

We also understand that privacy is a top concern. That's why you can protect your entries with a password to ensure that only you have access to your personal thoughts.

Get daily reminders to make sure you don't miss any entries and view your past entries to recognize progress and patterns in your thinking and feeling. We believe that journaling is an important step towards self-reflection and personal growth, and we hope that 365 & me will help you unleash your full potential.

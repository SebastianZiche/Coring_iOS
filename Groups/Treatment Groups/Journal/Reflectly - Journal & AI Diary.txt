App Description
Reflectly is the #1 journaling app that’s like your best friend. Vent your thoughts & feelings to improve your mood and practice mindfulness. Write down how you feel each day in your own mood diary. It’s the world’s first intelligent journal app & mood tracker that gives you personalized motivation and prompts the more you use it.

THE BEST JOURNAL APP FOR SELF-CARE AND MINDFULNESS

How you’re feeling on a daily basis matters. Reflectly is a personal journal driven by AI to help you deal with negative thoughts and increase positivity.

Be prepared for stress relief, reducing anxiety & depression in your life. Your self-care and mental health should always be a priority.

Reflectly uses positive psychology, mindfulness, and cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) to help you thrive. It gives you the tools and mindset to build a positive cycle with our habit tracker. Fancy a bit of self-dating? Reflectly supports your self-love journey.

Never journaled before? No need to worry, our intelligent journal system gives you personalized prompts and reminders. If you want to build a health-focused lifestyle, increase motivation & gratitude, practice mindfulness, or combat anxiety, our personalized questions encourage deeper reflection.

RECOMMENDED BY PROFESSIONALS

Journaling is a respected method to improve your mood, productivity, and mental health. Psychologists, therapists, and industry experts reaffirm this. It’s time to invest in your self-care routine.

HOW REFLECTLY WORKS

• Write down how you feel each day. Morning daily motivation quotes & challenges, evening daily insights, and whenever you need to vent.
• Using AI & smart tech, Reflectly’s mood tracker helps by showing you mood correlations and graphs. Been stressed for the last 10 days and can’t pin-point why? Reflectly has answers.
• We ask personalized questions based on your diary entries so you can reflect deeper.
• Read or edit previous journal entries.
• Receive daily, weekly, and monthly overviews with personalized insights and reminders.

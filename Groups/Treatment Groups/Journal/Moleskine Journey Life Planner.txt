App Description
Moleskine Journey is a life planner created to design your day.

Designed for creative minds, independent workers, audacious backpackers, and free spirits, Moleskine Journey uniquely combines the best features of productivity apps (calendars, events, to-do lists, tasks, reminders, and notes) with features for personal growth and self-care (habit trackers and journals).

With our life planner you can organize and document any aspect of your life from one single app.

With Moleskine Journey you can enjoy recording your days, your goals, your priorities, your special moments and habits in one place.

Daily reminders, to do lists and calendars will keep you schedule your important self-care moments and stay on top on your work/life activities. Journals will help you record meaningful day-to-day interactions and thoughts to keep track of the things that matter most to you.

Use your creativity to uniquely combine productivity features with personal growth and self-care tools to create your unique life planner. Express yourself like never before.

Use our collection of Journal templates, their features let you journal on many topics.

Templates currently available: the routine journal, the sleep journal, the mood journal, the expenses journal, the mindfulness journal, the food journal, the gratitude journal, mental health journal, and the weight tracking journal.

But what make our journals special and unique is the possibility to customize them with custom prompts and type of entries, such as photos, link, quotes, tasks, and much more. So if you don’t find the journal that suit your needs you can always create one of your own or hack the existing ones.

HOW DOES A LIFE PLANNER WORK?
Here's how you can use our app every day to stay on top of your work and your life.

Start your day by opening the app and checking your calendar events and tasks for the day.

Then, open your journal and set up customizable prompts to create a taylor-made journal. Write down your intentions for the day and any thoughts that come to mind, so you can be more aware of your emotions and feelings every day.

Plan your work and personal tasks in the to-do lists and check them off as you complete them to make sure you're moving according to your goals and priorities.

Use the weekly list for work to plan everything in advance and mark off tasks day by day. If the list isn't fully completed by the end of the week, move the unfinished tasks to the following week.

For your well-being, keep a daily routine that repeats each day. Track your activities, such as reading, meditating, and drinking water, in Moleskine Journey. You can create a daily routine to tick off each activity or create a specific journal for each activity you care about.

At the end of the day, record your mood, finish your journal entries, and plan some activities for the next day.

This is how you can use the app, but there are many more features and ways to use the life planner.

Our idea is to create a modular system where you can adapt your experience according to your needs and goals.

Moleskine Journey is a membership service with a free trial. Download the app free to try it out without restriction. After the trial period you can choose to purchase a membership which allows unlimited use across all of your devices. Without an active membership, you can still use the app in read-only mode.

    From now on, by swiping right you add a content or complete the main action on the Habit (e.g.: complete a challenge), tapping on it will open the history, and swiping right will give access to all the other actions. This works on the Planner card too!
    Please let us know if you get used to this and if you like it.
    Looking forward for your feedback and suggestions, let us know what improvement would you like to see in the next releases.

Version 0.201230.129 (Jan 2, 2021)
    Hi guys!
    2020 has been a tough year, we were separated from each other, both at home and work, and we saw many friends only through a smartphone screen.
    The issues we've been through made clearer than ever the value of the things we accomplish with the people we love.
    That's why in this new version we added one of the most requested feature: shared habits!
    Share a Journal with other Moleskine Journey users to create a collective diary, or your Daily Goals to get things done in your team, or even beautiful shared Photo Diaries to have a great place to keep your memories with your friends and family.
    We hope this will help you going through the days that separate us from when we can hug each other again, even just a little.
    May the 2021 be the greatest year in your life.

    As usual we fixed the problems reported and made some actions more reliable and clear. Because of the new share feature, if you want to copy a content and share it with third party app you should now use the export feature.
    Feel free to write us to contact us for any suggestions and feedback.

Version 0.200922.101 (Sep 24, 2020)
    Hi everybody!
    Here we are with a new release of Moleskine Journey. We focused on improving the experience and on fixing some pesky bugs you reported, moreover we're rolling out the much requested Reminders integration.
    Let's dig into this update:

    - We fixed a bug that prevented you from adding entries in the past and future when a Habit had just been created.
    - We fixed some issues on recurring tasks (duplication, errors on the time shown). Thanks to the users that reported these cases!
    - Solved an issue causing a lag showing project title when opening a project
    - We redesigned the weekly and monthly view of the planner, performance should be better and look is cleaner and ready for further improvements
    - You can now find your calendars events right from the search box
    - NEW FEATURE: this is big! We integrated Apple Reminders into the app, you can now see, edit, and mark as complete every reminder you scheduled into Reminders from Journey's Planner (reminders without a due date are not shown). Let us know what you think of it and if it fits your use case. Many users asked for this integration and we're happy to roll this out.
    - A leap forward in making Journey more like you: the app has now nine themes you can choose from, try them and pick your favorite color from the Settings menu.

    We work to make each experience in Journey as straightforward and intuitive as possible, but there are info about the features we cannot express right into the app and ways of using Journey that are best explained in more detail.
    We added links to our growing user guide and FAQ page into the Tips menu and into the feedback menu. Please take a look at them and let us know what aspect of the service that aren't covered and you'd like to read about.

    Mmmh… this changelog came out longer than expected… but in fact this is a hefty update! Hope you enjoy using it as much as we loved working on it. Feel free to write us to give us your suggestions and feedback.
Version 0.200804.96 (Aug 5, 2020)
    Hi guys!
    We fixed the bugs reported and made some actions more intuitive.
    Thank you for your feedback and reports! Feel free to write us to report any issue or give us your suggestions.
    Enjoy the summer! Stay safe :)
Version 0.200726.91 (Jul 27, 2020)
    Hi there! Step by step we're making Journey closer to the vision we have for the service and to what you asked for during these months.
    Now you can set a recurrence rule to the new habits: do you want to run 2 times a week? Do you want to write your journal every Friday? When you create the habit you can set these rules.
    You can set a reminder for your habits: you'd like to be notified to be sure to complete the meditation challenge you just set? Set the reminder on the habit and you'll never forget to do it!
    Try these new options and let us know if something is missing.
    Some users asked for a simple way to duplicate their projects as it is useful to use a project with a good structure as a template for the new ones. Piece of cake: use the 'Duplicate' action in the project menu.
    At each release we try to fix the bugs reported and solve all that issues that hinder the experience. We'll eventually fix them all but we give them priority according to your feedback, if you think something really important should be done please write us to let us know.

Version 0.200711.87 (Jul 14, 2020)
    Hi guys!
    The most requested feature so far is here: Journey is now integrated with Apple Pencil!
    You can now add your sketches and handwritten notes into your journal, projects and day pages. Whenever you feel inspired to jot down an idea with the Pencil just tap on the add button and add a new sketch to get started.
    Let us know your feedback about this, we're eager to hear your ideas and suggestions :)

    We also fixed many bugs and minor issues you reported and added a new interface for the fast editing of events on Mac.
Version 0.200701.84 (Jul 2, 2020)
    Hi everybody!
    Here we are with a new release of Moleskine Journey.
    We worked on many different things, from little design tweaks to core improvements to the experience. Here are the main changes:
    Extended Journal: we worked a lot on this. You can now add much more to your journal or personal diary. Many of you gave us the feedback that a text-only journal was not enough to express themselves, so we decided to let you add images, titles, and links to each day. You’re free to organize these contents as you wish and you’ll have a beautiful preview for each day based on what you add.
    This is the first step toward more advanced features we’ll add to all the habits, to make it easier to reach your goals and be aware of your progress.
    Score for every habit: the score tab is now available on every habit, for example you can check how consistent you are in your journaling, checking how many days you added an entry for or what's your longest streak.
    Improved export: some of you asked for more control when exporting contents, we heard you, you can now export selecting a specific date range, for example you can now export your journal or photo diary on a monthly basis keeping the final document size smaller and easier to back up.
    Fast access for all projects (Mac, iPad): we improved the left side menu and now it shows the list of all of your projects, so that will be easier to pick the one you’re looking for.
    Are these features the one you were waiting for? What do you want to see in the app next?
    Contact us for any suggestions or feedback!

Version 0.200517.69 (May 18, 2020)
    Hi there! We have great news! Both on the iPad and on the Mac app we radically changed the app layout. Navigation is now much more intuitive and this solution addresses many experience issues you reported. This is also a step forward to align the Mac and web experience.

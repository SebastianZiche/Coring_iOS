Learn what affects your mood, develop healthier thought patterns, problem solve with the AI chatbot, practice effective coping skills, build resilience, and foster personal growth.

HOW IT WORKS
CBT is a proven method that's been rigorously studied and widely endorsed in the world of mental health. Its core principle is simple yet powerful: by understanding and changing your thoughts, you can better manage your emotions and actions.

Clarity also integrates other effective therapy models like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Positive Psychology, and Mindfulness to bring you the best self-care tools offered by modern science.

AI-INFUSED JOURNALING & CHAT
- Step into the future of mental health with innovative AI features.
- Journal with AI-driven questions and analysis that adapt to your mental state.
- Feel heard with a thoughtful and compassionate AI Chatbot trained in CBT.

CHECK IN FOR INSIGHTS & REWARDS

TESTIMONIALS
"This app has saved my life."

"It feels like I have a therapist in my pocket."

"I have never recommended any app more than this one. I’m almost positive after using this app you will feel better and less stressed than before you got it!"

"This app is the only app/journal/therapy thing that has genuinely helped me. Just using this app for 2 weeks has given me more insight and mental health help than my therapist of a year. I’ve never felt better after starting to use Clarity, and I genuinely don’t think I would’ve been able to get here on my own."

DESIGNED WITH PURPOSE
We believe in increasing access to mental health care by sharing knowledge and self-help techniques that one might only learn about in a therapist’s office. Clarity was created with care by a team with backgrounds in clinical psychology and mental health research.

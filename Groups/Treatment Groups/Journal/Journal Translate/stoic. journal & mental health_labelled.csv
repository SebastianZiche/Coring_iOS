This update brings so many changes that it got a special screen inside the app with a deeper explanation. TL DR of the most important additions: Trends Screen with charts of your mood productivity and activity. Many of you asked for some kind of visualization of data you are entering. It may help you understand how you are doing and how these indicators change in time. iCloud all your entries will have a backup and will sync between multiple devices. Thoughts exercise a simplified stoic interpretation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Whenever you will feel strong negative emotions try to put corresponding thoughts into this exercise.

After a month of struggles and fights with the new database this update can finally see the sunlight. It contains mostly under the hood changes and some small improvements but it also lays a foundation for the next update. And the next one will be huge. It will roll a feature that many of you asked and that I promised exactly 27 times in the last week : You can only guess what it is. So changes changes changes: Holly suggested adding a pause button to the meditation exercise. I additionally implemented the possibility to insert notes during breaks. I know it may contradict with meditation teachings to clear mind completely so keep in mind that meditation is about being present and use notes only in special cases f. eg. when a brilliant idea pops in your mind and you are afraid to lose it. Francisco gave me in depth feedback about the reorganization of You and Exercises sections. I m still working on this but you can see first symptoms already here. Andrew suggested a possibility to turn off vibrations. I might have gone too far with the number of vibrations but I find it very weirdly satisfying... You can turn it off from settings if you wish. Irma suggested a new history layout and splitting journaling and questions. for anyone knowing me personally yes this is this Irma my Irma and she really pushed me to change that view. Also huge thanks to Kingman Agata and many many more for pointing various bugs. Hope ya have a wonderful week : Maciej ps. Last week I had a pleasure to talk with some of you via Skype and longer mail conversations about your stories related to Stoicism how you use the app and what you expect from it.

After a month of struggles and fights with the new database this update can finally see the sunlight. It contains mostly under the hood changes and some small improvements but it also lays a foundation for the next update. And the next one will be huge. It will roll a feature that many of you asked and that I promised exactly 27 times in the last week : You can only guess what it is. So changes changes changes: Holly suggested adding a pause button to the meditation exercise. I additionally implemented the possibility to insert notes during breaks. I know it may contradict with meditation teachings to clear mind completely so keep in mind that meditation is about being present and use notes only in special cases f. eg. when a brilliant idea pops in your mind and you are afraid to lose it. Francisco gave me in depth feedback about the reorganization of You and Exercises sections. I m still working on this but you can see first symptoms already here. Andrew suggested a possibility to turn off vibrations. I might have gone too far with the number of vibrations but I find it very weirdly satisfying... You can turn it off from settings if you wish. Irma suggested a new history layout and splitting journaling and questions. for anyone knowing me personally yes this is this Irma my Irma and she really pushed me to change that view. Also huge thanks to Kingman Agata and many many more for pointing various bugs. Hope ya have a wonderful week : Maciej ps.

Introduced by Tim Ferriss during his TED Talk helped me personally overcome some difficult decisions in my life. I hope many of you will find a similar experience. Beside that: Clinton suggested adding Apple Health Kit support and logging meditation and breathing as mindful moments. Andrew noticed that there were some errors during export. Irma suggested splitting the history of journaling and questions responses. Since exercises are taking bigger and bigger part of all activities taken in Stoic it was a good moment to redesign the history screen.

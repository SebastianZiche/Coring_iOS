App Promotional Text
Simple diary can only be read back a year later.
You become subconsciously aware of what you wrote.
Please throw positive words and dreams to yourself through this diary.
App Description
It's a diary application to yourself a year from now.
Since you write with the intention of not being able to read it again for a year, you become "subconsciously" aware of what you wrote.
By writing down your goals, what you want to do, and who you want to be, you will be more aware of them throughout the year.
If you are strongly aware of them, your life and behavior will gradually change toward them.
In other words, it is a diary for your personal growth.

You don't have to write every day.
You won't mind if there are days you didn't write.
You would rather more interested in the days you wrote.
There is also a countdown function that displays the number of days until the next time you can read your diary.

You can only be read back one day per year.
It can be read back for exactly one day exactly one year after it was written and the same day each year thereafter.
For example, if you write a diary on July 21, 2022, it will appear only on the same day each year, such as July 21,2023, July 21,2024, and so on.
You can only read it back for that one day (24 hours).
As you read diaries you wrote one, two, or three years ago, you write to yourself one, two, or three years in the future.

Basically Free, No Ads
Some options are available for a fee, but it is free of charge as a diary.
No annoying ads will appear on the writing page. 
Ads will only appear on the calendar and the settings page.

"Questions for You" assists your diary.
It can display questions that will help you look at yourself objectively and be positive on your life.
You can read the questions about twice a week.
For example, 
"What habits do you want to develop over the next year?",
"What do you want to quit now?"
" What do you want to improve over the next year? ".
There are more than 200 questions.
For a fee (3$), you can read the questions every day.
In such the case, more in-depth questions will appear. 
Care should be taken before bedtime so as not to overthink and lose sleep. 
Sensitive people may need to be especially careful.
You can also choose not to read the questions in the settings.

Diary data is stored in iCloud, so you can share your diary with multiple devices(iPhone and iPad).

When can you read the diary you wrote on February 29, a leap year, , ,
you will know when the day comes.

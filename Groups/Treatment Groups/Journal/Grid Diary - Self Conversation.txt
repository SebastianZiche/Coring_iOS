App Description
Instead of wondering what you should write about each day, Grid Diary is introducing a unique way of writing a diary. It combines powerful diary and planner templates with reflective prompts to help you focus on the areas of life you want to track and flourish in every way. Did you ever try to keep a diary but never succeeded? Or did you have writer's block problem? Grid Diary is here for you.

In Grid Diary, diary entry is made up of a number of "Grids", which is as simple as a question, prompt, or etc. It is like a pre-defined template for the diary. Thinking and writing in this way is more effective. Grid Diary empowers you to focus on the areas of life you want to track, use profound prompts to help you reflect on your days and gain thrilling insights about yourself.

Q:
Why is self-talk important?

A:
Self-talk is important in many ways. It’s the script that we use to frame our lives. If we constantly give ourselves negative messages, then we begin to develop automatic thoughts that take us from a particular incident to a negative emotional reaction. Conversely, if we engage in positive self-talk, we begin to view the world in a more positive manner and will ultimately feel better about ourselves. We can’t always control what happens, but we can control how we react to it!

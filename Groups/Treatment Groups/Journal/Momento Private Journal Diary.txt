Version 3.3 (Mar 26, 2016)
    We’re excited to announce that v3.3 is here and it’s jam packed with loads of new features and enhancements!

    Here’s what’s new:

    *Export*
    You can now export your data as a plain text file along with all your photos. As well as exporting all your data, you can customise and filter exports such as specifying the date range of your export or only exporting moments with specific people, places and tags.

    *Calendar*
    The new calendar is accessible directly from the Timeline. Quickly jump to any date and get a monthly overview of the days that contain moments and feed entries. The calendar is particularly useful for seeing which days you missed capturing a moment.

    *Improved Photo Adding*
    You now have the option of choosing how photos get organised when adding moments to Momento — store photos at the time they were taken and group them intelligently (which has been the default behaviour in Momento 3) or simply attach the photo to the moment (like Momento Classic). This also means you can now attach photos to existing moments.

    *Quick Actions*
    For those of your with devices that support 3D Touch (iPhone 6s and 6s Plus), you can now launch straight into a ‘New Moment’, ‘Check-in’ or ‘Add Photos’ right from the home screen. Just press on the Momento icon to see the options.

    Enhancements:

    - Attach photos to existing moments thanks to the improved photo adding.
    - ‘This Day’ option is now available when adding photos. This makes it really easy to add photos to a day in the past (Navigate to a day > Tap ••• button in Navbar > Choose ‘Add Moment’).
    - Moments can now be easily added alongside feed entries (Tap the ••• button alongside a feed entry > Choose ‘Add Moment’). The moment will automatically inherit people, places and tags from the feed entry.
    - When adding tags you can now type the tag and simply tap the ‘Next’ button to continue.
    - Single photos can now be removed from a moment.

    Fixed:

    - Fixed a bug which caused some characters to present incomplete search results.
    - Fixed a bug which led to Facebook photos and videos to no longer load.
    - Minor bug fixes.

Version 3.2 (Feb 27, 2016)
    Here’s what’s new in this version:

    *Restore*
    You can now restore your data from backups created by Momento. This makes transferring data to a new device simple, especially if you would prefer not to restore from a device backup. Remember to keep regular backups of your Momento data, either locally or in iCloud, using the backups feature.

    *Summary Preferences*
    If you would prefer a more minimal Day, Month and Year Timeline, you can now choose to hide maps and photos. In addition you can also choose to always show notes in the Summaries, otherwise Momento will intelligently choose what text to display based on the the days’ activities.

    Enhancements:

    - Reminders can now include custom notes — perfect for adding templated entries.
    - Albums and photos synced from the Photos app or iPhoto are now available when adding photos to Momento.
    - Albums are now shown in alphabetical order (where applicable) when adding photos to Momento.
    - Improved the range of nearby places when exploring places.
    - When adding a place to a moment after changing the location, the updated location is now remembered when re-selecting a place.
    - Recently added people and tags are now displayed in order with the most recent at the top.
    - Recently added people and tags are now updated after every change rather than every save to make them available when tagging multiple photos.
    - When merging people you now see ‘all’ people rather than just ‘with’ or ‘mentioned’.
    - Tags which include unicode characters (such as stars) are now displayed at the top of the tags list for easier access.
    - Improved contrast of lighter text throughout the UI for improved readability.
    - Other minor UI tweaks to improve usability.

    Fixed:

    - Fixed a crash when changing casing of tags.
    - Fixed a bug with maps not displaying correctly when merging places.
    - Fixed a bug which could display duplicate search results.
    - Fixed a bug which would cause the keyboard to cover text when writing a note.
    - Momento can now be launched using the momento-3:// URL scheme as well as momento:// to avoid conflict with Momento Classic.
    - Removed the ‘Name this event’ section when editing a moment.
    - Reminders now work correctly when switching timezones.
    - Update card now shows under the lock screen.

Version 3.1 (Jan 12, 2016)
    Here’s what’s new in this version:

    *Local Photo/Video Storage*
    A copy of photos and videos are now stored in Momento instead of referencing them from your Photo Library. Photos that were previously referenced will be automatically copied into Momento for safe-keeping. If you don’t have available storage existing photos will be referenced until enough storage is available.

    *Local Backup*
    If you prefer keeping your data out of the cloud, you can now store backups locally and move them to your computer for safe keeping using iTunes File Sharing.

    - Search existing places (not just those nearby) when adding a place to a moment
    - Moment and mention counts are now displayed when exploring people, places and tags

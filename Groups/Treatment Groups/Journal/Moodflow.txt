App Promotional Text
A beautiful mood & symptom tracker with a journal that analyses your data and tells you which factors in your life make you happier and which trigger unpleasant emotions
App Description
Mood Tracker / Year in Pixels / Diary / Habits / Gratitude Journal / Routines / Photo Album / Sleep - Everything you need to improve your mental health in only ONE app.

Moodflow is a FREE app that captures your emotions, moods, thoughts, and general well-being. Also, Moodflow goes along with you throughout your life, and gives you a more profound understanding of yourself, not previously known to you. Ultimately, this will allow you to improve your mental health and help you become a better you.


## HOW DOES MOODFLOW WORK? ##
You do not even need to write anything down to get a meaningful insight or to keep a diary.

This is how easy Moodflow works:
Fill out a quick survey every day and gain insight into the WHAT and HOW it influences you over time.

◆ 1. Pick a rating for the day from 1 to 5.

◆ 2. Pick the emotions you experienced.

◆ 3. (optional) Write a note about everything relevant from the day.

◆ 4. (optional) Pick the activities you were involved in.

◆ 5. DONE!


## WHAT WILL THIS DATA DO FOR ME? ##
As time goes by, these short entries will gather insightful data about yourself that you will be able to analyze in many ways. On the one hand, a Calendar will be filled with colors that reflect your emotional well-being. This will allow you to get an eagle-eye perspective on your life that you never had before. On the other hand, Moodflow comes with data-analyzing tools, that will help you find relationships between a plethora of different factors and your mood. Moodflow will help you understand yourself better by allowing you to identify the things that bring you up or those that pull you down.


## WHAT ELSE CAN MOODFLOW OFFER? ##
Additionally, Moodflow encourages you to develop better habits by including 28-day challenges. These challenges have different levels of difficulty and will ensure that you create simple but powerful habits. As some have claimed: "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit".

More features? We have them!

◆ Multiple entries per day: Our mood fluctuates throughout the day. Therefore, you should be able to make as many entries as you want.

◆ No annoying ads: Support the app by watching an advertisement. But only if you want to.

◆ Gratitude Journal: Write something you are grateful for every day and benefit from the power of gratitude.

◆ Routines: Use Moodflows in-built Routine planner to create your perfect routine and keep track of it. Step by step!

◆ Statistics & Insight: Find relationships between multiple factors and your well-being with the multitude of charts offered.

◆ Journal mode: Read all your entries at once as you would in a conventional journal.

◆ Customize everything: Moodflow is a very personal app, this is why we give you the freedom of personalizing almost anything!

◆ Color Editor: Create your own color palettes from scratch. Millions of possibilities!

◆ Background: Make Moodflow your personal app by even personalizing the background video or image.

◆ And a lot more!

OUR USERS SAY:

“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”

“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized. I have already recommended this digital planner to multiple people/platforms!’’

“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly, I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future."

Version 2.5.3 (Oct 19, 2021)
    NEW FEATURE! We are so excited to launch a new way of making routines! Now it is easier to see, build, edit and repeat a collection of activities into a routine and place this in your daily schedule.

    The update contains:

    - New App+watch feature: Routines

    [Visual Changes]

    - Library: Create Routines now appear in the Routine library section
    - My Day: Routines appear in their own block which can be expanded to show more detail
    - My Day: Routines can be planned or to do anytime
    - Right now: Activities within the routine also show the name of the routine

    As routines now have their own duration, they can be planned to start at a set time, or they can be flexible, to be started at any time. You can also pause your routine, and restart it when it suits you. Visually, routines look different to other activities, so you can see them more clearly in your My Day view. At a glance you can see the activity that you have on now, and the one that is coming next.

    Other cool features include being able to check off activities in your routine if you complete them early, and being able to edit your routine on a particular day without it affecting your template routine in the library. It is also easier to build your own routines with activity suggestions.

    Thank you so much for all the support and feedback that you give us. Your ideas and comments really go a long way into shaping the app and in the design of new features like this. A special thanks to everyone helping us test and finalise the feature.

    PS. If you like our app, please don’t hesitate to rate and review us. It means the world to us!

    [Visual changes]

    * Right now: supporting multiple ongoing activities

    It’s no exaggeration that we have been looking SO MUCH forward to sharing this release with you! A lot of hard work, love, and tears have been put into this new feature. Today we are launching flexible activities in Tiimo.

    It means you can now make activities with a duration, and simply press start now when it fits you. You can also pause flexible activities and start them again when it fits. Dont worry - you can still use tiimo exactly like you did before, planning activities in a timed schedule. But now you have the option to not set a specific time for certain activities as well!

    It means you can have many activities ongoing at the same time. That is why we have added a little thumbnail for “Right now” of your ongoing activities so you can switch in focus between different activities.

    We’ve made some visual changes to the activity card in My Day as well. Icons are moved to the right side so that you quickly browse through your day visually with activities and checklist items.

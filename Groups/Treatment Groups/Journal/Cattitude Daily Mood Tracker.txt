App Description
Cattitude is a personal and fun way to track or share your daily mood. Simply choose a cat GIF to describe your current emotions and add a description to complete your daily log. With Cattitude, you can keep a private journal or find support from others who can relate to your feelings. Cattitude empowers you to stay mindful and learn more about yourself by making check-ins with our widget on your home screen. You can also review past entries on Cattitude for deeper self-reflection and save recent emotion summaries to share with your closest friends.

Cats may have nine lives but we only have one, self-care is more important than ever.

Version 1.8 (Jul 19, 2021)
    Get excited, this is a big one! Zinnia’s latest update includes:

    - Deselect button. Now you can deselect everything on your screen! Great for when you have multiple objects selected, or are zoomed in and want to have nothing selected. Find it on the bottom toolbar next to the trash can.

    - Zoom to full page. Zoom out to a full page view with the tap of a button. When zooming in on your page, watch your zoom state on the bottom right of your screen. Tap the button to return to full page view.

    - Font size slider. Instead of + - buttons to adjust font size, we now have a slider to make it easier for quick adjustments. Try it out by selecting text and navigating to the text styles menu.

    - New setting to turn on Apple Pencil exclusively for drawing. Use the Apple Pencil to draw or handwrite, even if you’re in text mode or in the Studio.

    - Find related content. Find something you love? Now you can view the pack it came from and see related/similar content. You can access this in Search within the Studio, by long-holding your finger on any search result.

    This update also includes under-the-hood bug fixes and performance improvements, like updates to iCloud syncing and drawing with Apple Pencil.

    Happy journaling, friends!
Version 1.7 (Jun 7, 2021)
    Our latest update to Zinnia includes a brand new font picker, so you can now bring your own fonts into Zinnia. With the native iOS font picker, any fonts saved on your device will be recognized and usable in Zinnia. More fonts = more fun experimenting!

    We also have added a brand new, interactive User Guide that explains everything you need to know about Zinnia (and probably reveals some things you never knew). The guide includes videos, gifs, and tons of bright images sure to make you a Zinnia pro in no time. Check it out in the Settings (...) menu, under Help > User Guide.

    Lastly, there's a number of under-the-hood performance improvements, like updates to iCloud syncing and drawing with Apple Pencil.

    Happy journaling, friends.
Version 1.6.2 (May 24, 2021)
    This update fixes an issue with washi tape and also includes some iCloud performance improvements.

    Version 1.6:

    Get excited - our latest update to Zinnia includes TWO hotly requested new features.

    * Passcodes! Set up a passcode to lock down your Zinnia app and keep your private stuff away from prying eyes.
    * Alignment tool! Our new alignment tool helps you align your images, stickers, and other assets to one another, for a more organized-looking spread.

    We are also adding a new type of Studio content - full page, custom-designed spreads made exclusively from existing Studio content. These spreads are great because many have editable titles and use stickers, washi tape, and all kinds of Studio content, which you can use on their own when you ungroup the template.

    Lastly, there's lots of under-the-hood improvements like:

    * Improved performance for complex vector images
    * A variety of bug fixes
    * Apple Pencil updates for the iPad
    * Updates to play nicely with iOS 14.5

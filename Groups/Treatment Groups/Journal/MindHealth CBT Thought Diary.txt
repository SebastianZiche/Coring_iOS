App Description
Our Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) app is designed for those seeking to improve their mental health and increase their emotional resilience.

It provides the opportunity to practice cognitive behavioral therapy anytime, anywhere. The main feature of our app is an automatic thought diary. It allows users to write down their negative and positive thoughts, be aware of them and look for ways to process them.

Automatic Thought Diary helps users understand how their thoughts affect their mood, behavior and emotional state. Working with the automatic thought diary is one of the main tools of cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps users to better understand their thoughts and emotions, as well as to get rid of psychological problems.

The principle of working with the automatic thought diary is that the user keeps notes about his thoughts and feelings in certain situations that cause him discomfort or stress. By writing down their thoughts, the user learns to recognize automatic and negative thoughts that cause them depression, anxiety or other problems.

As a result of working with the automatic thoughts diary, the user will learn to recognize and change his/her automatic thoughts, which will help him/her overcome psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and others. In addition, working with the automatic thoughts diary helps users to become more conscious and emotionally stable, which in turn improves their quality of life and allows them to better manage their emotions.

An additional feature of our app are psychological tests. They allow users to gain a deeper understanding of their emotions, thoughts and behavior. After taking the tests, users receive individualized feedback and advice on managing their emotions and thoughts.

The following psychological tests are currently available:

1. depression test is a psychological test that helps to assess the presence and degree of depressive symptoms in the user. The test consists of several questions that deal with aspects such as mood, energy, sleep, appetite and interest in life. The results of the test help to determine how serious the user's mood and ability to enjoy life is, as well as to identify the presence of symptoms of depression.

2. Anxiety test is a psychological test that helps to assess the user's level of anxiety. The test consists of several questions that deal with aspects such as anxiety, tension, fear and nervousness. The results of the test allow you to determine how much anxiety the user has and identify the presence of symptoms of anxiety.

3. An eating disorder test is a psychological test that helps determine the presence and extent of an eating disorder in a user. The test consists of several questions that deal with aspects such as eating behavior, feelings of hunger and satiety, desire to control one's weight and eating large quantities of food. The results of the test determine how serious the user's eating behavior problems are and identify the presence of eating disorder symptoms.

Psychology articles are also available in the app to help users better understand the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and apply them to everyday life. The articles include specific tips and exercises that can be used to overcome negative thoughts and emotions.

Before making any medical decisions or if you have any questions about your health, we strongly recommend that you seek the advice of a qualified physician.

App Description
Spend just 5 minutes a day using Brighter to become a happier, healthier you.

According to the Mayo Clinic:
“Expressing gratitude is associated with a host of mental and physical benefits. Studies have shown that feeling thankful can improve sleep, mood and immunity. Gratitude can decrease depression, anxiety, difficulties with chronic pain and risk of disease. If a pill that could do this, everyone would be taking it.”

Use the Brighter Gratitude Journal to express thanks and appreciation for the positive things in your life. Answer the daily prompts or create your own prompts. Set reminders to make gratitude a habit. Add one gratitude entry a day or add multiple entries throughout the day. Add a photo to each entry and create a gratitude (vision) board in the process.

Brighter is a simple, flexible tool to help you appreciate the little (and big) things in your life.

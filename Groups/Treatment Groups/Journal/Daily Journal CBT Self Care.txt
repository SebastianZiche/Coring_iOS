App Description
Getting to know your true, authentic self is a lifelong journey. Daily Journal is your guide to daily self-care. You can use to track your moods and jot down your feelings. And This is a App that allows you to process complex thoughts and emotions, which helps promote positive thinking and self-talk.

***WHY DO YOU NEED A DAILY JOURNAL?***

Having a consistent recording of your life can be invaluable because it allows you to track personal patterns or behaviors over time. This history can show your personal growth and give you memories of important moments in your life

***SURPRISING BENEFITS OF DAILY JOURNAL***

1. Can Reduce stress and anxiety.

Journaling about your anxieties soothes your nerves and helps you brainstorm for solutions to your problems.

You can also use the mood tracker found in Daily Journal to indicate your sentiment level. Overall, expressing yourself in a diary is a good way to free up any tension that prevents you from feeling happy.

2. Helps you learn from your experiences.

Daily Journal is a good way to help us to stop, take a step back and reflect on ourselves. We can look back at our life in a journal and think about how we've changed and what we can do to improve ourselves.

When you journal and reflect on the day, you’re more likely to draw lessons from what you’ve gone through.

3. Improves your communication skills.

When you journal, you learn to better express yourself. And this lets you better communicate your feelings with others.

The more self-aware you become, the more you can make yourself understood to others.

4. Improves your mindfulness.

Writing about your surroundings and the present moment helps you become more mindful every day – even when you’re not journaling. It teaches you to pay attention and be present. Daily Journal brings you into that state of mindfulness.

5. Boosts your self-esteem.

Positive journaling has been found to help improve feelings of well-being and self-esteem. A lack of confidence usually means an inner critic or a voice of self-doubt. And although that voice never goes away, journaling puts it into perspective. It gives space for your positive thoughts so the negatives don’t take over.

6. Helps you sleep better.

Bedtime worry about incomplete future tasks contributes significantly to people’s difficulty in falling asleep. If you have trouble falling asleep at night, you can try writing in a journal, focusing specifically on positive events. This may help you sleep longer and better, according to research.

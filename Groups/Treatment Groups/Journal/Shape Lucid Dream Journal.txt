What is lucid dreaming? It's the art of awakening within the dream world. Once lucid, dreamers can fly, face fears, perform deep personal work, practice a skill, meditate, visit a wise person, anything.

Lucid dreaming clarifies the nature of reality and the role perception plays in defining how we exist in the world, freeing the dreamer from self-imposed limitations.

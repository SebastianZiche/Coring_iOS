App App Store Notes
We really value Moodnotes’ low-key approach to promoting positive thinking. Our part is easy: recording how we feel each day. Moodnotes responds with gentle encouragement, posing insightful questions and showing us patterns. It even points out possible thought traps we might’ve fallen into (like overgeneralizing or using emotional reasoning). With its guidance, we have a healthier understanding of what’s on our mind.
App Description
Don’t let your mood affect your life. Take control over it!

Meet Moodnotes - a super easy mood tracker & journaling app to capture your mood and help you improve your thinking habits. Moodnotes empowers you to track your mood over time, avoid common thinking traps, and develop perspectives associated with increased happiness and well-being.

Version 2.3.7 (Oct 16, 2019)
    Thank you for your support of Moodnotes! 

    This update addresses:
    • iOS 13 compatibility.
    • Upgrade to CloudKit syncing system (be sure to update Moodnotes on all the devices you sync to).
    • Minor bug fixes with FaceID for some users.
    • Fix for duplicate entries and data export crashes for some users.

    NOTE: There may have been some instances where iCloud sync may have caused invalid data to be created in the app. Tapping 'Remove Duplicates' (in the Data menu tab) should correct the issue and clean up any stale data causing crashes.

    Please keep your amazing ratings and reviews coming. We read them all! : D
Version 2.3.6 (Dec 22, 2018)
    Thank you so much for using Moodnotes! We know how important notifications and custom reminders are, and that they were a bit buggy for some users. This update should get you back on track! If you're still having trouble, please email us at support@thriveport.com and we will investigate individual cases.

    Please keep your amazing ratings and reviews coming. We read them all! : D
Version 2.3.5 (Oct 5, 2018)
    Bug fixes and general improvements... But of course we're not just going to leave it at that!

    Did you know that you could change the date on an entry? You didn't? Sorry about that. We could have done better in letting you know that! Now there's a new shiny, tappable icon next to the date.

    So, some of you informed us that your reminders weren't coming through. That's not good! We've got that fixed and you should be getting your reminders again. We did have to remove the Smart Reminders feature for now because, well, it just wasn't being as smart as we thought it was. We will look into teaching it some new tricks and see if it can make it back in the future.

    There were also a few minor layout issues we saw with the latest OS so we cleaned those up as well.

    Thank you so much for using Moodnotes. The stories you have shared with us through reviews and email are truly heartwarming!
Version 2.3.4 (Aug 14, 2018)
    Normally, this is where app developers would say "general bug fixes and improvements" right? We'll we've done those things but thought we'd tell you what those actually are :D We just like sharing like that!

    So we've updated the entry detail screen to have a bit more modern code. Hopefully we did it in a way that looks the same but just feels a bit snappier!

    We've also updated the watch app thanks to some of your suggestions (start with a neutral face you said, and we did).

    Along with that, we completely rebuilt all the PDF export code to address many of the issues you all have told us about (thanks for letting us know!).

    So that's the highlights of the "general bug fixes and updates".

    Thanks so much for using Moodnotes and sharing with us what you love and how we can make it better. It really does mean a lot to us!

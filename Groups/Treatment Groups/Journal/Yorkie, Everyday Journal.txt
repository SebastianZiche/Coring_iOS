App Description
Yorkie is a personal and private journal for writing down your thoughts, memories, and ideas. Store your photos alongside in a nice timeline. Unlike other journal apps, you aren't required, nor asked to share your posts to your friends or the public. Your posts are automatically saved to your private iCloud account, so they are accessible on all your devices and automatically backed up.

Look back into the past and remember what you had done or thought of. Relive that moment.

FEATURES
---
– Private. You are not pressured nor asked to share your posts with your friends or the public
– Face ID and Touch ID support for protecting access to your posts
– Clean user interface. Your content is key, the app tries to avoid unnecessary UI wherever possible
– Stats. The app shows some stats on how many posts you have created as well as number of words/per post
– Reminders. Daily Reminders help you build a habit to write daily.
– Tag posts with activities
– Quick action support in the homescreen to start writing
– Live Photo support

Version 1.9.1 (May 5, 2014)
    Bug fix causing app not to work for new users.

    v1.9:

    + We now have a brand new timestamp picker in the composer that is easier and faster to use. We heard from users who want to enter their old journal entries which they have kept many years, and the new timestamp picker now lets you post-date very old posts.
    + App is now more efficient with loading
    + Always wanting to make it easier to write journal entries, the app now asks if you want to use the timestamp of the photo when attaching one
    + The photo picker is also much faster now
    + Added a 'thought' activity
    + There's also lots more testing and clean up done in this release, so the app is now much more stable!

    - Fix: issues with edited posts being not displayed correctly in timeline until app is restarted - Fix: Unable to unlock if reminder alert popup in passcode screen
    - Fix: Reminder time isn’t displayed correctly
    - Fix: multiple crashes

    We love to hear from users, so email us feedback from within the app.

Version 1.5.1 (Jan 31, 2014)
    Fix crash sometimes when changing date of a post

    Fix composer doesn't prompt to discard a post correctly
Version 1.5 (Jan 20, 2014)
    Couple of improvements related to selecting photos
    ===
    Back from a trip with 600 photos, eager to journal them, but find that every time you go into the photo picker, you have to scroll through all the photos? I have enhanced the photo picker so it remembers your last position.
    I frequently like to take several shots of the same scene or portrait so I don't miss anything. (blinking eyes, I'm looking at you). The thumbnails in the photo picker is a little too small to spot the differences. So now, when you tap and hold on a photo, a bigger preview pops up.
    You can now add the most recently taken photo with a single tap.
    Also renamed the action sheet labels so they are clearer.
Version 1.4 (Jan 11, 2014)
    Features
    ===
    Themes. This is still very basic at the moment. The app will continue to feature your content prominently, but we will be adding a dash of colors in the near future. Themes are available in More > Options > Theme. Also see "Awesome Subscription" below.

    UI touch ups
    ===
    The app generally is brighter now due to a slight change of colors used

    Awesome Subscription
    ===
    There is now an in-app purchase option when you tap to select a different theme. Find it in More > Options > Theme. You can only subscribe for a month at a time at the moment. If you don't subscribe, you'll still be able to use the app free. Awesome subscribers will generally be able to unlock additional features. This will go towards further development. Thanks for supporting indie developers!
Version 1.3 (Dec 13, 2013)
    Facts and tips
    ===
    There's nothing ike a daily fact or tip to help lift up spirits or learn something new. The app now shows a fact or tip at the top of the timeline. I've tried to make it readable, yet not distracting.

    UI touch ups
    ===
    Improve look of date picker in compose screen
    Remove gaps betwen emote bars in the timeline
    Improve diagnostic line in feedback email
Version 1.2 (Nov 27, 2013)
    UI touch ups
    ===
    – Notably showing/hiding of navigation bar and status bar when scrolling, so you can view more of your content and less of the UI.
    – Tweak display of mood bars in the timeline.

    Stats, stats, stats
    ===
    I love stats. We're starting simple. You'll see the number of photos you have posted, the number of posts you have created, as well as the average number of words in each post. While stats are important, your posts are still key. So it's subtle – pull down your timeline and hold while at the top and you'll see your stats.

    Bug fixes
    ===
    – When you tap on a post with a photo and cancel, you shouldn't be prompted to discard changes if you haven't made any.

    Like/don't like what you are seeing? Rate or write a review. Most importantly, write me an email. I love to hear your thoughts on the app. You can do it in the app by going to More > About > Questions/Feedback.
Version 1.1 (Nov 21, 2013)
    You can now export your posts and photos
    ===
    We want to build a journal that lasts. We totally understand that at some point, you might not want to use our service anymore. That's cool with us, we'll always give you a way to export your entries, so dig in and starting journaling, you can check out any time you like :)

    This new export functionality is still a bit raw. In time, we will have a much prettier export.

    Some tweaks for feedback/email
    ===
    We added a line with some diagnostic information to help us fix issues.

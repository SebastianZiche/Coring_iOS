App Promotional Text
Dayflect is a one-line-a-day diary app that lets you write about each day in a simple, manageable way.
App Description
More than a daily journal, Dayflect accumulates entries from successive years, allowing users to revisit past memories on a specific day and reflect on change and growth.

Key Features:
▸ TEXT MEMORIES
Save your memories by writing about your day while reflecting on your past at the same time.

▸ PHOTO MEMORIES
Save your memories by uploading photos that will remind you of the day.

▸ PIN & BIOMETRIC LOCK
Protect your memories from prying eyes with an optional PIN or biometric lock.

▸ EXPORT
Export all your entries as an Excel file at any time you'd like.

▸ REMINDER NOTIFICATION
Be reminded every day at a set time to log your memories.

▸ DARK MODE
Save your eyes from burning by turning on dark mode.

▸ CLOUD SAVING
Your memory entries are saved in the cloud tied to your account. Even if you lose your phone or uninstall the app, your memories are never lost.

▸ ENCRYPTED DATA
Saved memories are protected with encryption and no one will be able to read what you wrote, except for you.

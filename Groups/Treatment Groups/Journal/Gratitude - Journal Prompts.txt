App Description
The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.

With a gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.

To live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.

And, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.

Here are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:

1. GRATITUDE JOURNAL

A gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.

In daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.

The Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.

You can also add photos to your journal entries and can record journals in your voice, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.

2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS

If you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations.

Positive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.

They give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.

The Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.

You can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.

Positive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.

3. CREATE VISION BOARDS

Another super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.

In the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!

4. DAILY ZEN

We understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.

Here, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.

5. MINDFUL MINUTES

We define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.

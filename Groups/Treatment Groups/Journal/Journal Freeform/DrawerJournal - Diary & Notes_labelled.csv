It is a fusion of a diary and a drawer and is so well done that it is a wonder that this icon has not been used before. Three Premium Themes Added The three new premium themes Champagne Lavender and Deep Purple are of the highest quality ever and the other themes that will be affected by these three themes will be the subject of future improvements. We would like to improve all premium themes and we aim to create a living theme that is not the end of the world. When a single image is posted on the calendar screen adjust the size so that the entire image is visible. We have received many comments from people who take pictures of their food or their dog but they would have preferred to see the entire picture like before so we have made this change. Our team holds review meetings every week so please continue to let us know your various opinions. Suggestion box: drawer.diary gmail.com or form in the app Fixed a bug that prevented playback of the most recently recorded audio when posting audio in succession. Changed the order of display so that when four images are posted they are displayed in the following order: top left top right bottom left and bottom right. Changed the post button to be a little bit larger and to have a more muted color. We hope that these changes will reduce the number of I can t press the button... .

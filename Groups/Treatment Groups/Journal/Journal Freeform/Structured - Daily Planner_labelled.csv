This update addresses most of these issues. It fixes many bugs and crashes. Additionally we ve worked on improving the speed of updating widgets. We hope these improvements make your work more productive and your breaks more enjoyable. If you continue to encounter any problems please let us know! The Structured Team,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This time we introduce support for some new features around widgets which were just released with the new iOS. Besides that we spent a lot of time optimizing things behind the scenes and have fixed over 100 bugs! Especially the calendar and reminders integration are more reliable and smoother. Interactive Widgets With the latest iOS update widgets can finally be interactive and we are here on day one to support it. This means you can check off your tasks without having to open the app even from your lock screen. Simply tap the checkmark or circle to toggle a task and if there is no checkmark because the widget is too small try tapping the title of the task. StandBy Mode Another big addition to the recent iOS update is the new StandBy mode. Whenever you charge your phone is in landscape a new beautiful display of the current time will show up. You also have the option to add your own widgets and of course we recommend adding the Structured widget which was optimized specifically for this. StandBy is perfect for keeping an eye on your timeline while at your desk and interactive widgets work here too. Customizable Widgets Another significant change to widgets is the ability to customize some aspects of it. You can now choose to display all day tasks at the top of a Timeline widget control if the Plus button is shown or set the order of tasks in the new Inbox widget upsi spoiler . New Widgets With all these changes to widgets they became so powerful that we just had to add some more. Say hello to the new Inbox widget and a special Subtasks widget. The Subtasks widget also lets you complete subtasks directly from your home screen. Missing Lock Screen Widgets If you previously had Lock Screen widgets installed you may have noticed that they have disappeared. Don t worry they are still available and you simply have to re add them once. We had to do this for technical reasons. Thanks for your understanding. We hope you enjoy all these changes and look forward to your feedback. All the best The Structured Team,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fixed a bug where the app would freeze when selecting a task on macOS. The year is coming to an end and it s time to look back at what happened in 2022.

You ll be able to view and share them from the 30th of December in Settings. We can t wait to see yours! At the same time we also want to look forward and are excited about many fantastic things to come in 2023. We can t wait! Meanwhile have some relaxing holidays and a happy new year.

Timezone Support! Set timezones for tasks to help with travelling and planning meetings. Stunning new app icon! 70 new icons including winter icons and better recommendations. We are super excited to release a big update today! Structured 3.0 will dramatically improve your planning adapt if things don t go as planned and help you when travelling. Drag Drop This has probably been the number one request feature and it is super powerful. You can simply press and hold a task until it pops out of the timeline and then drag it wherever you like. A small preview will show you where the task will be once dropped. But it doesn t stop there. Drag and drop is so deeply integrated into Structured and it works almost everywhere. You can take a task from the inbox and drop it into your day move something to the next day by dropping it on the day at the top and even create a task at a specific time by dragging the Plus button there. On top of all that drag and drop also integrates with the system. You can drag stuff like emails or links into Structured and it will automatically create a task for you. At the same time you can also take a task and drag it out into other apps to create a link to it. There is a lot to explore with drag and drop so go head and move stuff around. Plans sometimes change and that s ok. Timezones People that travel a lot or work with people from other parts of the world know that timezones can sometimes be confusing. If you have a meeting with someone in New York at 1 PM their time when do I need to show up in Berlin it s 7 PM With Structured 3.0 this is now much easier. When creating a task you can assign it a timezone and set the time in that timezone. It will then appear at your local time in your plan so you ll never miss a meeting again. When travelling you can also decide which tasks should stay at a fixed time e.g. a meeting with someone back home or which should adjust to your new location e.g. lunch at 12 . To get the later behavior simply select Floating time zone but don t worry it s also the default one for your tasks. New App Icon As soon as you update you ll probably notice that the app icon on your home screen looks a bit different. Unfortunately we had to adjust the icon since it looked very similar to another company logo but I m happy we had to. The talented Matthew Skills did an outstanding job at designing the new. He even designed a few variations which you can select in the settings and the amazing Donatus Wolf took it upon himself to create one in the style of one sec which you can unlock by enabling the integration. Better Icon Recommendations New Icons There is not only a new app icon but also 70 new icons you can use for your tasks including specific ones for the winter season sorry Southern Hemisphere . This bumps the number of icons to over 600 but luckily the automatic icon selection has also gotten much better so you ll spend less time looking for the right one. Thanks to everyone who requested new icons and make sure to keep them coming if you are missing the perfect icon for your task. Additionally where are also some smaller changes like a more compact visualization of overlapping tasks and bug fixes. Also make sure to check out our blog at structured.app blog http: structured.app blog for a nice video showing the new features! Leo,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Fixed a bug where recurring events were duplicating. Improved translations for Simplified Chines Korean Japanese Thai and Finish. Added a monthly yearly subscription for Structured Pro. If you already have Structured Pro you ll keep lifetime access! One of the key parts of Structured are those small icons you can choose for every task. They make it easy to see what s up at a glance can help categories your task and just add this extra touch. They were inspired by the little stickers you can put into your paper planners but have the added benefit of never running out and Structured 2.3 you ve got a big new pack of those in your mail not literally . 400 New Icons Today s update adds over 400 new icons and updates some existing ones bringing the total to over 550 icons. New icons include a vacuum cleaner or broom for cleaning up a slice of pizza or burger if you get hungry Instagram or Twitter logos if you need to post a picture of your food and a hammock if you need to relax after eating it. But all these icons also want to get found and scrolling through 550 might be relaxing but will probably not get you closer to your goals. That s why I ve added tons of new features to the brand new icons view. All New Icons Picker First and foremost all the icons are grouped into 17 different Categories and you can quickly jump to the correct one using the Categories Bar at the bottom. Alternatively you can also use the Search Bar at the top to find a fitting icon or pick one of the suggested ones I m working on improving the suggestions soon . If you have a few favorite icons you use over and over again may I suggest the candy icon they will pop up in the Recently used section where you can quickly access them. Premium Icons Some new icons are now part of Structured Pro and require you to upgrade to use them. If you ve upgrade to Structured Pro in the past you ll already have access to all premium and free icons. All old and some new icons 250 in total can be used by all Structured users for free. These include icons for cycling knitting and importantly all school related icons. Still missing icons 550 icons cover plenty of different activities as everyone s life is different I m sure there are still some missing. If you can t find the perfect icon for your hobby or pet simply use the Request Icon form at the bottom and I ll do my best to add more icons in future updates. What else changed Besides adding 400 icons and improving the icon pickers I ve also reworked the inner workings of recurring tasks. This does not bring any new features but should fix a bug where they kept duplicating and improve their performance. The translation for Simplified Chines Korean Japanese Thai and Finish should now also be more consistent. Other than that Structured is now offering a yearly and monthly plan in addition to the existing lifetime plan.

On top of all that you can also choose out of more than 20 notification sounds including some animal sounds . Customizing alerts requires Structured Pro but now for the first time you can get notifications at the beginning of the task for free. Additionally you ll find two new and old app icons in the Appearance section of the Settings.

Alright on to the changes. This is a bug fix release which may sound boring but who doesn t like it when things just work better ! NEW Thumbnails of your private snippets are now blurred everywhere and we really mean everywhere! Hopefully you like those context menus we added on snippets in Journal projects and Freestyle Collabs because we brought them all over to Freestyle projects as well. FIXED This stuff is hard to describe in words but if you tried to rotate and then flip a snippet and it didn t do what you expected especially if you zoomed in give it another go. We think you ll be happy with the results! The volume of videos in 1SE now matches what you hear in the Photos app instead of being louder. Your volume settings will better reflect what you ll hear in other apps when you share your mashed movies. There are a handful of little improvements and fixes like hiding the spinner after you edit snippets in a freestyle project making sure the calendar and day screens agree about your available videos and scrolling to the bottom of Freestyle Collabs when you open them. We also made a bunch of tweaks to colors for light and dark mode. We fixed a handful of crashes in the media picker calendar day and Freestyle screens. We would love to hear any and all feedback.

Are you ready takes a deep breath NEW HDR support is here! If your device can record in HDR your videos will be in glorious HDR in the app. Note that if you switch to a different phone it may not be able to properly display HDR videos We ve added a mirror option so you can make your selfie snippets look exactly how you like it! You can now flip your snippets horizontally if that s your kind of thing. If you use your phone in light mode then you might be excited to hear that we now have light and dark modes! By default it switches based on your system s setting and if you want to override that you can choose to always have it in light or dark mode. Now you can edit photos just like you edit videos with brightness rotation and cropping to fit the frame! We added context menus all over the place so you can tap and hold on days and snippets to quickly do things like auto fill a single day or copy a snippet to other projects. We freshened up the font and positioning of dates and captions on your videos. There s one more thing that you might find if you dig around a bit... FIXED We squashed a bug that was causing some people to get stuck while mashing. Freestyle Collab mashes now obey the laws of causality and the videos will always play in the correct order. If you switch away from 1SE and back again the app should now be waiting for you just as you left it. Instead of you know crashing in the background. We would love to hear any and all feedback.

Can you believe this year is almost over We ve mainly been squashing bugs and tightening screws with this release but here are the main changes: We revamped the profile and account management screens to make it quicker and more intuitive. We ve also generally refreshed the look for a sleeker design if we do say so ourselves. We changed the thumbnail images for your journal projects on the home screen to show the most recent snippet instead of the oldest. Shared GIFs now loop properly sorry about that! After restoring from a backup or when first updating to version 4.0 your projects will show up in a more sensible order. We have finally found a solution for the iCloud shared album issue. This has been a long time coming we appreciate your patience as we worked hard on fixing this issue! We ve added a possible fix for people being randomly signed out. Please reach out if you notice this happening. A number of design tweaks and bug fixes to make your app experience even better! We would love to hear any and all feedback.

Mark your snippets as private so that they re excluded from your mashed movies unless you explicitly include them.

There s now a totally new way to make mashes even more customizable. You can select and deselect months at a time and you can even tap on individual snippets to include or exclude them! Combined with private snippets it s easier and faster than ever to mash specific movies like someone s birthday over the years or all the snippets with your dog from the last few weeks. Fixes: We made sharing snippets faster and way less likely to crash on older phones. Fixed the Pro link from our website. Fixed an issue allowing the same snippet to be added to a mashed video multiple times Nixed a crash that some users experienced during mashing It s now possible to submit debug logs when you re not using the default Mail app The camera will stop bugging you for location access We fixed a bug where your videos that were recorded today wouldn t show up in 1SE until you relaunched the app. The calendar is even faster at showing which days have videos available on them now!

You may have noticed some phantom snippets appear after replacing or deleting a snippet in a day. That won t happen anymore and you shouldn t see them again. Ever. If you signed up for an account and are backing up now you may have noticed that it didn t look like every snippet was being backed up. That was because of those pesky phantom snippets and is also fixed now. Deleting projects didn t work properly so we made it work because that was kind of embarrassing. But we didn t stop there! It was a little slow so we also made it a lot faster! When recording with the camera in 1SE you may have ended up with videos that didn t fill the entire screen with a pleasant 16:9 aspect ratio. Surprise! We fixed that too! You should always get 16:9 recordings with our camera now. We made it a bit faster and smoother to scrub around when you re cutting a snippet.

Original release notes for version 1.70000 are below: Hold on to your butts! This is a pretty hefty update. First and foremost we ve fixed a bunch of bugs for all of you intrepid iOS 11 folks. Thanks for bearing with us. We also added new journal editor when you tap into a day we called this the diary before but it s the same deal . One change to note is that we are doing some housekeeping and no longer show mashed movies in 1SE. But fear not! They are always available in the 1SE album in your Photos app where you have access to more editing and sharing features. NEW Added new mashing presets so you can easily mash a season. When you tap the play button to mash a video choose Presets on the left then tap Seasons in the middle and pick a season on the right. There s a way to automatically fill in all of the visible the orange days in your timeline! Tap the purple magic wand button next to the mash button in the bottom right corner. You can choose to keep or discard the generate snippets so there s no risk and you can try it again to get different choices. This is really cool and we think you ll like it a lot. If you already found this by shaking your phone thanks for helping us test it out You can choose to automatically add location names to new snippets for each project instead of it being all or nothing. The default setting is still the same where you get locations in freestyle projects and don t get them in timelines. Go into the project list and hit the little edit pencil icon by a project title to change this option for existing projects. IMPROVED When you re recording a snippet with 1SE and leave the app or get interrupted by say a phone call your video is saved to your photo library immediately so it doesn t get lost. Save looping snippet videos to your photo library with one tap. Added a button to share mashed movies with Messages. If you select a lot of snippets really fast in a row you may have seen the mysterious message Unknown error 6: Cannot Decode or other weird things happen. Now things should work more smoothly you just may have to be a bit patient and wait for your phone to catch up if you go really fast. We recommend getting a nice beverage and taking a few more seconds to choose your hand crafted artisanal gluten free snippets. But if you want to speed through it that should be better now. Hi Dave! The scroll the scroll the buttons the buttons. Scrollin so smooth like the butter on a muffin. FIXED Recorded videos work properly when your phone is locked in portrait orientation on iOS 11. Mashed movies had some problems with audio going out of sync when shared to Facebook and video corruption when sent to a Mac or PC and opened in VLC and other video apps. Thankfully this should no longer be the case. Share my friends share! A few of you had thumbnails disappear. They should reappear in this version and we regret the error.

First and foremost we ve fixed a bunch of bugs for all of you intrepid iOS 11 folks. Thanks for bearing with us.

UPDATE: iOS 9 users if the app was crashing on launch this new version should fix that for you. Our sincere apologies about that! Please let us know if you continue to have any issues. One change to note is that we are doing some housekeeping and no longer show mashed movies in 1SE. But fear not! They are always available in the 1SE album in your Photos app where you have access to more editing and sharing features. NEW Added new mashing presets so you can easily mash a season. When you tap the play button to mash a video choose Presets on the left then tap Seasons in the middle and pick a season on the right. There s a way to automatically fill in all of the visible the orange days in your timeline! Tap the purple magic wand button next to the mash button in the bottom right corner. You can choose to keep or discard the generate snippets so there s no risk and you can try it again to get different choices. This is really cool and we think you ll like it a lot. If you already found this by shaking your phone thanks for helping us test it out You can choose to automatically add location names to new snippets for each project instead of it being all or nothing. The default setting is still the same where you get locations in freestyle projects and don t get them in timelines. Go into the project list and hit the little edit pencil icon by a project title to change this option for existing projects. IMPROVED When you re recording a snippet with 1SE and leave the app or get interrupted by say a phone call your video is saved to your photo library immediately so it doesn t get lost.

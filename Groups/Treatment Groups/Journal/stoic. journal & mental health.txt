What's New

Version 2024.7 (Feb 25, 2024)
    dear stoics.

    this update brings the option to switch back to the old button UI for mood check-ins instead of new sliders.

    it will also add:

    - new iMessage stickers
    - journaling suggestions in reflections. you can add them in morning/evening reflection personalization.

    best,
    m.
Version 2024.6 (Feb 14, 2024)
    dear stoics,

    we need to address a significant topic — the much-debated slider feature. in our upcoming update, we will introduce an option allowing you to switch from the slider to traditional buttons, aligning with your preferences.

    currently, you have the ability to disable the mood checkin on the launch by navigating to your profile -> preferences.

    despite this change, we maintain our stance that the slider offers a superior user experience.

    best,
    m.
Version 2024.5 (Feb 8, 2024)
    dear stoics.

    in this update, we polished our new redesign a bit further.

    we’ve also given you the preference to skip the mood check-in while opening the app if you don’t want it.

    we’ve also added some easter eggs to the app and you can let us know in our discord if you find them!

    this update is huge and changes a few things in the app, so to make this transition smooth you will see a quick onboarding flow after the next opening of the app (even if you use the app for X years).

    this update changes and adds:

    - you can now specify what "metrics" you want to track during morning and evening reflections (like sleep quality, stress experienced during the day, productivity, etc.)

    - adds 326 new journaling prompts (not kidding nor exaggerating) - you will see them during morning & evening reflections after selecting daily focus.
    till now every time you picked eg. "work" you got the same follow-up question. now every day you will get a different prompt related to work.

    - adds new gratitude prompts - every day during morning reflection you will get one prompt to exercise your gratitude muscle.
    you can specify in settings (your profile -> personalize) if you don't want to see it, or if you also want to see similar prompts during evening reflections.

    - adds new trends view - no more waiting for data to load, now it appears instantly and all charts got a refreshed design.
    in the following app updates, we will add an option to view previous weeks' data and change periods (weeks/months/years), so if your favorite chart disappeared please don’t despair, it will be back soon in a fresh form.

    - improves quote sharing - you can now export a quote with a beautiful background image of my dog. (also a reminder, a few updates ago we added an option to change the background image when you read quotes or affirmations).

    - adds new exercises suggestions - after morning & evening reflections you will see a new screen with suggestions based on your day focus and how you feel.

    - adds new day focus category - “partner”.

    - adds new affirmation prompts - if you open quotes/affirmations and click the journaling button (next to the "star" and share buttons) you will see a list of prompts that will help you think about how to use a particular quote/affirmation in your life.

    - fixes the favorite exercises popup - you can now dismiss this view easily.

    Dear Stoics!

    This update is a little bit boring since it only tries to fix:

    • shows iCloud syncing errors

    My apologies if you experienced inconvenience related to any of these errors (and thank you so much, Alexander, Jamie, Joe, and Sarah for pointing all bugs.)

    The previous updates were much cooler, so to remind you what happened:
    • Trends Screen - charts of your mood, productivity, and activity. It may help you understand how you are doing and how these indicators change in time.
    • Personalized routines - you will see content and questions based on obstacles you are facing and how you feel.
    • iCloud - all your entries will have a backup and will sync between multiple devices.
    • Thoughts exercise - a simplified-stoic interpretation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
    • Customizable icon - you can pick your favorite app icon to match the style of your black/white/colorful device (or your laundry)

    See you next week!

    This update brings so many changes that it got a special screen inside the app with a deeper explanation.

    TL;DR of the most important additions:

    • Trends Screen with charts of your mood, productivity, and activity. Many of you asked for some kind of visualization of data you are entering. It may help you understand how you are doing and how these indicators change in time.

    • iCloud - all your entries will have a backup and will sync between multiple devices.

    • Thoughts exercise - a simplified-stoic interpretation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Whenever you will feel strong negative emotions, try to put corresponding thoughts into this exercise. You may notice, that your feelings were caused by your thoughts, and after a small shift in the way of thinking, you may experience a significant uplift of your mood.

    See you next week!

Version 3.8 (Jun 26, 2019)
    Dear Stoics.
    After a month of struggles and fights with the new database, this update can finally see the sunlight. It contains mostly under-the-hood changes and some small improvements, but it also lays a foundation for the next update. And the next one will be huge. It will roll a feature that many of you asked and that I promised exactly 27 times in the last week :) You can only guess what it is.

    So, changes changes changes:

    • Holly suggested adding a pause button to the meditation exercise. I additionally implemented the possibility to insert notes during breaks.
    I know it may contradict with meditation teachings to clear mind completely, so keep in mind that meditation is about being present and use notes only in special cases (f. eg. when a brilliant idea pops in your mind and you are afraid to lose it.)

    • Francisco gave me in-depth feedback about the reorganization of “You” and “Exercises” sections. I’m still working on this but you can see first symptoms already here.

    • Andrew suggested a possibility to turn off vibrations. I might have gone too far with the number of vibrations, but I find it very weirdly satisfying... You can turn it off from settings if you wish.

    • Irma suggested a new history layout and splitting journaling and questions. (for anyone knowing me personally - yes, this is this Irma, my Irma, and she really pushed me to change that view.)

    • Also huge thanks to Kingman, Agata and many many more for pointing various bugs.

    Hope ya have a wonderful week :)
    Maciej

    ps. Last week I had a pleasure to talk with some of you via Skype and longer mail conversations about your stories related to Stoicism, how you use the app and what you expect from it. This experience was eye-opening. I’m thrilled and additionally, a little bit intimidated knowing how many amazing people use Stoic. Expect many improvements.

Version 3.6 (May 11, 2019)
    Dear Stoics,

    In this quick follow-up update after the Fear Setting introduction, the Stoic app will help you get a more peaceful meditation session.
    My apologies to everyone who experienced crashes with Health Kit integration (that allows logging mindful minutes to your Health app.)

    Have a great update,
    M.
Version 3.5 (May 7, 2019)
    Dear Stoics,

    This update brings a new exercise - Fear Setting. Introduced by Tim Ferriss during his TED Talk, helped me personally overcome some difficult decisions in my life. I hope many of you will find a similar experience.

    Beside that:
    - Clinton suggested adding Apple Health Kit support and logging meditation and breathing as mindful moments.
    - Andrew noticed that there were some errors during export.
    - Irma suggested splitting the history of journaling and questions responses. Since exercises are taking bigger and bigger part of all activities taken in Stoic, it was a good moment to redesign the history screen.
    - Huge thanks to Natalia for checking spelling and grammar in many questions and Joe for correcting quotes.

    Have a great day,
    Maciej

    Ps. Excuse me if I have not responded to your message yet. I promise to reach back to everyone.
Version 3.4 (Apr 10, 2019)
    Dear Stoics,

    Nick wrote to me with an idea to incorporate meditation and breathing exercises into the app. Thanks to him, you will be able to build a morning routine of reading Stoic quotes, meditation, and journaling - all in one place.
    Please check exercises screen and also add new Today's widgets.

    Allen asked to remove misleading "X" from the journal exercise and proposed better naming of the initial skip button.

    Ross wished to see the history view with written words counters instead of counting character.

    Have a great day.
    M.
Version 3.3 (Feb 27, 2019)
    Dear Stoics,
    Gregory pointed out that there was a pesky bug when responding to questions - some responses copied to other text fields. My apologies for that mistake. After this update, you won’t need to click save button too - all responses will save automatically.

    Stephanie and Morgan asked if there is a way to fill gaps if you miss a day or two. Now there is - on the main screen you will find a calendar button that enables changing current date.

    Cris asked if he could somehow add a title to each day. It would make browsing through history easier. As a way of filling this request, you will find a text field under the main date. Whatever you type there will appear in the history next to the date.

    Additionally, this update brings 40 new questions and quotes, Apple Watch Application and iMessage Stickers. Hope it will satisfy your curiosity till next update.

    Have a great day.

Version 3.1 (Jan 31, 2019)
    Dear Stoics,

    In this update, you will find a new section created specifically for Stoic exercises. Additionally, on the main screen, there is a field to name a day with a short sentence. Hope it will help you navigate the history page better.

    Keep smiling.

Beautiful and simple to use diary with password.
App Description
We all have feelings and emotions but very often it is really hard to share them with other persons. Even before smartphones many of us use to write in a real diary witch many times was just a notepad in which we were writing down everything that we felt without worrying that we will be judged. Many of us, if not all, made our diary a secret diary just to be sure that no one reads it. Either is was a love diary or just a daily diary we loved it and share every emotion and thought. First crush, fight with your parents, first heartbreak, the time when you really felt in love ... all these moments were always shared with your dear diary.

Now, in our modern times, the simple old trusty journal notepad had become a application on our mobile device which allows us to do more in less time and very often in a more secure way.
With that in mind we though to put our ideas, regarding to what WE believe a journal should be, in making a simple, intuitive and comprehensive diary application that will be your partner who listens but doesn't share anything that you think and feel.

To make it perfect for how we would like it to be we have included the following cool features:

A DIARY THAT IS SIMPLE, INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE - simplicity is the first thing in our minds

- easy and intuitive navigation between entries
- calendar functionality that allows to navigate and filter trough your journal
- possibility to add images on each entry
- image gallery - all your intimate journal moments in one place
- PDF export functionality for when you want to print or share your entries
- search functionality
- multiple settings that are easy to understand and use
- overview on all log entries
- simple design which make it easy to use
- FREE diary will all functionality available

A SECRET DIARY NEEDS TO BE SAFE AND SECURED

- password protected - what used to be a physical journal with lock you now have a diary with password
- auto lock functionality in case someone looks at your phone when your are not expecting
- backup and restore functionality - whenever your need to change your phone or in case you lose it
- complete reset and delete functionality - just in case you need to erase everything

STYLE & CUSTOMISATION - Make it feel like "MY diary"

- emoji / emoticons stickers - share how you feel - can be used as a "Mood Diary"
- multiple color styles - you need to make it personal and intimate
- multiple fonts styles and font sizes
- reminders - something that your old diary couldn't do

WORD CLOUD - Visualise your life, emotions and feelings in one place

- a place where most used words in your diary are displayed in one place in a beautiful way
- allows you to filter your entries based on your most used words


Sentiments and feelings are part of our life and sharing them with someone or even for ourselves in a simple diary can make our life more enjoyable and pleasant. Reading what we've wrote in the past can help us understand who we are and what moments have defined our life. In a complex and always in a hurry world, writing down your precious moments in a intimate way in a intimate journal will always help you embrace the world in a beautiful and healthy way.

We hope you will find this application useful and will grow to love to use it.

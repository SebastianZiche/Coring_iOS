App Description
Punkt makes journaling secure, private, easy and fun. But the best of starting a journal now is that you become a happier person.

Here's what makes Punkt special:

* EASY TO USE *
Punkt's focus is on a simple design. Your stories are the most important part of the app, so why should we distract you with any other complicated stuff?

* SECURE AND PRIVATE *
Punkt saves your stories on your local device and in your private iCloud. No one but you can read your stories. You can also protect your stories with Face ID or Touch ID.

* NO LOGIN, NO ADS *
Punkt works without sharing any personally identifiable information. The app is focused on simplicity and privacy. There is no login, no Facebook or Google SDKs, no analytics tracking, no server connection. Everything you do in Punkt is truly private and secure.

* ACCESSIBILITY *
Punkt supports dynamic type, voice-over and voice control. It is designed to be used by everyone. I would welcome any feedback regarding accessibility as this is truly important to me.

* FAIR PRICING *
Punkt is developed just by one developer, therefore I want to make really fair and transparent pricing. If Punkt makes you just a little bit happier, you can help to contribute that the app stays independent and does not need to display ads or require personal data.

---------------

Why did I start building this app? I'm a startup founder myself and I've been through very rough but also hyper exciting and happy times. That's tough by itself, but if one of your loved ones is helpless in pain and suffers then your world stops spinning. Bad times in business and private life made me think about how I can get out of this and become more positive and happier in the end. I've researched a lot and came across the one-sentence journaling technique. Long story short, I've started tracking my days in a Google Sheet. With just a few clicks I could make myself smile again by reading stories about happy days. But also the other way round, looking at rough times makes you appreciate even more what you have in your life. Now I want to help other people with this app.

If you have any feedback you can reach out at https://punktapp.me or gregor@punktapp.me

say goodbye to the stress & anxiety of using random self care apps/journals,

and say hello to personalized mini-therapies, curated mental wellbeing journeys, self care journal, & 10+ therapy tools

TRUSTED BY 500,000+ people in 140+ countries, and built on 30+ years of research by top therapist(s)

Version 3.8.6 (Dec 12, 2023)
    contextual insights, emotional diversity, and persona-based exploration:
    dive into a world of personalized mental health exploration with our latest feature update. now, you can explore a wide range of contexts such as 'self', 'work', 'relationships', and 'social media', and delve into a spectrum of feelings including 'fear', 'anger', 'stress', and 'loneliness'. this is tailored to resonate with a variety of personas, whether you're a 'college student', 'entrepreneur', or 'working professional', among others. each context, feeling, and persona has its own dedicated page, similar to our existing discomforts pages. simply tap on 'let's understand it better' to receive a customized psycho-educative message from psy (being ai). immerse yourself in diverse collections of mini-therapies across these different contexts, feelings, and personas. this personalized approach provides a nuanced and comprehensive exploration of your mental health, uniquely tailored to the specific circumstances and nuances of your life.
Version 3.8.5 (Dec 6, 2023)
    revamped AI journaling experience: dive deeper into your thoughts with our redesigned AI journaling feature on the discomforts page. we've shifted from bullet points to a more expansive, long-form journaling approach. this means you now have the freedom to express yourself in a way that feels most natural to you, with no constraints on structure. unleash your thoughts and feelings in a space that's truly your own.

Version 3.8.4 (Nov 29, 2023)
    new: discomfort and core issue pages got a make-over. a good one. a very good one. a very very good one and i mean it

    improved: the most important part of the makeover is the ease with which you access mini-therapies your discomforts. tap one to open a discomfort page and tap two (without scrolling or figuring or thinking) to start a mini-therapy

    improved: the second most important part of the makeover is to help you find more related discomforts or should i say more ‘accurate discomforts’ to what you’re looking for. tap one to open a discomfort or core issue page and scroll one to see all things related

    ‘understand’ anything: so when you are on a discomfort or core issue page but you are not sure and want to quickly learn more about it → tap the ‘let’s understand’ button/card and let us swiftly help you there

    less mess: tbh, there were lots of scattered pieces (of information) on both discomfort and core issue pages — we have removed many that didn’t make sense and grouped the rest beautifully so it makes sense without trying hard to make sense

    smarter collections: core issue pages are now very well organized to allow you to see how you relate to each issue, get started with any, and also dive deeper when you feel like ..

    immediate next: 1, journal is getting a make-over along with a long overdue all-journals page for you to go back to, 2 a limited but free forever version of being, and 3 collections for different areas of life such as relationships, work, family, college, etc
Version 3.8.3 (Nov 23, 2023)
    new: onboarding questions now shows the more consistent look (except sign in page, that still needs some work)

    updated: onboarding questions have been reduced to two from five. you select the two most essential pieces (areas you’re looking to improve and issues that are holding you back) to get started with ‘being’. the rest can happen later

    next: we’re running a bit late but we should ship new discomfort and science pages by friday (24th of nov’23). will make it super nice and easy for you to access mini-therapies, discover related discomforts, and try ai support
Version 3.8.2 (Nov 16, 2023)
    new: just made pay-what-you-can official. from $0.99 to $9.99 a month — you choose to pay what you can comfortably afford .. no questions asked

    new: collections done better (easier to navigate, much faster, vertical scroll) with more intelligent suggestions

    Hey there

    With this release, we've made searching for mini-therapies easier than before.
    You think you couldn't find a mini-therapy for how you were feeling? You can now share your discomforts with us, and we'll get mini-therapies made for you.

    Also, less bugs! Not that I'm saying there were any bugs before. But there are definitely fewer now ;)

    Sending so much love for you, being!

    And, those bugs you reported? We've squashed them too.

    As always, keep writing to us. We're listening.

    Sending so much love for you.

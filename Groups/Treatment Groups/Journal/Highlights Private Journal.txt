App Description
WHY HIGHLIGHTS?

• JUST ONE HIGHLIGHT A DAY
Reflect on the most important moment of your day. Your highlight isn't limited to work — it could be a delightful dinner with friends or a serene walk in the park. Every little moment counts.

• PERSONALISE WITH EMOJIS
Emojis say more than 1000 words... or maybe not.

• ADD TAGS
Feeling sleepy, cozy, or energised? Tag your day accordingly.

• SECURE AND PRIVATE
Your highlights are stored on your local device and in your private iCloud. No one but you can read your stories. You can also protect your Stories with Face ID or Touch ID.

• NO LOGIN, NO ADS
We don't like logins either.

So why wait? Start your journey with Highlights.

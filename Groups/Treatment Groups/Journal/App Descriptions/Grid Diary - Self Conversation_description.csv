Q: Why is self talk important A: Self talk is important in many ways. It s the script that we use to frame our lives. If we constantly give ourselves negative messages then we begin to develop automatic thoughts that take us from a particular incident to a negative emotional reaction. Conversely if we engage in positive self talk we begin to view the world in a more positive manner and will ultimately feel better about ourselves. We can t always control what happens but we can control how we react to it! Tim Legg MD

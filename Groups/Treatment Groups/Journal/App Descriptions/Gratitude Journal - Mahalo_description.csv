All over the world people who keep a gratitude journal or practice gratitude experience improved stress relief anxiety relief self love self care more motivation and improved mindfulness. Mahalo is the easiest way to practice gratitude and make it a habit that you will do every single day. Each day a new gratitude practice will be available. When you open the app the first thing you will see is the newest practice for you to start. The practices are meant to take between two and ten minutes they are meant to be short in part because practicing gratitude should impact the rest of your day outside of the time spent practicing in the app. After you have completed your daily practice the next practice will not be available until the following day. We suggest that you add reminders so it is easier to build the habit of practicing gratitude. A gratitude diary is a sacred place where you can open up to yourself and explore your own thoughts and feelings. That means privacy is important: Any things that you write in a Mahalo practice is only for your eyes and is not available to anyone else. Mahalo means thank you. Thank you for the life I live. Thank you for the good times and the bad. Thank you to myself for never giving up. Thank you.

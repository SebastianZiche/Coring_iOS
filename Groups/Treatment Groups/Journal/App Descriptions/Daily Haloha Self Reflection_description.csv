Take a moment for yourself each day to consider the question. This is your chance for self reflection. Remember you only answer the day s Haloha question once so make it count! A Haloha is a chance to truly be yourself and express your thoughts honestly because Halohas are anonymous and free of judgment. Once you fill in the blanks you select a Mood color that best fits your Haloha. And then you re ready to offer your personal Haloha to the rest of the world! 2 Pay it forward. When you send your Haloha it s randomly and anonymously delivered to another person somewhere in the world and instantly you ll get a Haloha back from another thoughtful and curious person. You can even see where in the world that Haloha came from. Then you can select a Response sticker to let the sender know they were heard! 3 Be part of the bigger picture. All the Halohas from the day are posted on the Haloha Wall so you can see what the world is thinking and feeling about the day s question. You can save any Haloha to your personal Scrapbook and also share them out to any of your social or personal channels. Remember to check the countdown clock to see when a new Haloha question will be available! This simple routine is a moment of reflection connection and gratitude to fuel and nourish your day.

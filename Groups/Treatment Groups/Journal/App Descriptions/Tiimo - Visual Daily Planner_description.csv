OUR USERS SAY: This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills. I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I m trying to stay organized. I have already recommended this digital planner to multiple people platforms! Tiimo makes me feel in control because I m able to see my day visually and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.

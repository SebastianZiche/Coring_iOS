1635759048,0,Memoly Dein Tagebuch,Lifestyle,2022-09-13,2022-09-13,76.73,2,0,0,1,Memoly is your diary through and through. Tailor Memoly to your needs so you ll never forget your memories. Now you re probably wondering: What makes Memoly so unique Simplicity Memoly is very easy to use. Just get started and capture memories. Don t worry about cumbersome logins and insecure synchronization. Just you and your diary. Customizable You only want to see the most important of your memory No problem. With Memoly you can freely configure your diary view. From minimalist to informative. It s up to you make something of it! Secure No one should be allowed to read your diary! And that s exactly what I think. That s why Memoly relies on iCloud. You can also back up your diary with FaceID or TouchID so no one gets access to your reminders. Ad free Nothing is more annoying than ads no matter where you look. That s why you won t find any ads on Memoly. This makes it easy for you to focus on yourself and your journal without distractions. Support Memoly is not a big corporation that is after your money and data on the contrary. Memoly is designed and developed by a single developer by me . There are some costs here and there for the development of the app. If you like the idea of Memoly and would like to support its further development in the future you can do so by subscribing to Memoly Pro. Fair prices Nobody likes apps that require you to pay a lot to use them at all. I don t like that either that s why I offer Memoly for free and leave the most important features for free. If you want to get more out of your diary you can unlock Memoly Pro. And that s for less than a cup of coffee a month. Feedback I need feedback and I want to hear your feedback as well. This is the only way Memoly can improve. If you have something go to https: memolyapp.de feedback and leave your feedback.

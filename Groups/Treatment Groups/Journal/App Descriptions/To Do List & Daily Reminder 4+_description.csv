Our pride and joy: The home screen on which you can see all your tasks and can edit each date with the swipe of one finger. Forming helpful habits: they re easy to create and even easier to track. A calendar to see your list of tasks for a particular day. Reminders you ll never miss! Tappsk will keep reminding you of your pending task until you decide what you want to do with it. Using your voice to record your tasks has never been easier... Share your tasks: use any convenient method to send them to your friends and they ll automatically show up in their Tappsk. Subtasks: create checklists and divide your tasks into smaller chunks. An array of routine activities based on your interests: select and set the activities you do on a regular basis to appear as often as you like. Hidden lists: eg. lists of books or movies which will not show up on the home screen. A logbook that allows you to analyze your task history from any given day. Lots of tasks one Tappsk : If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact our support hello tappsk.com we are always ready to improve!

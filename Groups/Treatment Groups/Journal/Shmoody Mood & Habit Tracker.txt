App Description
Shmoody is your mental health and self-care toolkit to help you feel better on tough days, and build positive habits over time. We know what it's like because we've been there too.

Think of us as your one-stop-shop for mental health and self-care. A place with actionable tools to help with depression, anxiety, or whenever you're just feeling down.

WHAT YOU'LL GET:
-Mood tracker to gain insights into your mood patterns
-Simple actions you can take that will improve your mood right now
-Community peer support and accountability
-Challenges that support your long-term personal growth and development

If you are struggling with depression or anxiety, or if you’re just feeling down, then Shmoody can help.

WE'VE DEALT WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, TOO
-We know what it feels like to be stuck in bed and feel like there’s nothing we can do to feel better.
-We know what it’s like to procrastinate and worry when we feel we’re stuck in a rut.
-We know that it can feel like things will never get better.

WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE US FEEL BETTER

The founders of Shmoody have dealt with depression, anxiety, and addiction and have made real changes in their lives using daily, practical tools to improve their own mental health and self-care practices. We know the tools that actually work, and the clinical research that backs it up. We also know that a not-too-serious approach is the most effective way to make real changes, so we’ve developed an app that is as fun and welcoming as it is powerful and life-changing.

P.S. Now is the time to work on your mental health and start practicing self-care. It’s easy to feel like there’s nothing you can do. But there is. We’ve been there; we can help.

Prioritize your mental health and start practicing self-care today with Shmoody!

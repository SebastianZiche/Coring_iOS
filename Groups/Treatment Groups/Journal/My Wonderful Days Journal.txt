    - iPhone and iPad version all-in-1 with universal app.

    - Add multiple photos for every notes you write.



    About iCloud sync,

    - It's automatically turned on if you're compatible with it. It just works wonderfully at the background. If you don't want to use it, turn it off on the settings inside the app.

    - Please be patient!

    - It takes some time first time if you have many entries already. Please be patient. All your entries will be inserted automatically. Photo images might take some more time.

    - Everything goes automatically under the hood. You don't need to worry about anything.

    - Trying to edit one entry on two devices at the same time might cause some loss.

    - Lite version data will be automatically transferred.

    - Turning off iCloud sync inside the app will leave data on one device only and delete it on the cloud

    - Turning off iCloud on the device will lose the control of the data on the cloud



    Using iCloud, your data will be safe and you'll have control of your data on any device you have. If you have any questions, feel free to mail us at contact@hahaint.com :)

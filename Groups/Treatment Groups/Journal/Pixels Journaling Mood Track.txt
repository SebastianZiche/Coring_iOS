HOW DOES PIXELS WORK?

Discover the power of daily mood tracking with Pixels!

**Never miss a day:** With daily reminders. Get a notification to record your pixel!
**Every Day Is a Pixel**: Capture your daily mood with a simple tap, choosing from a range of colors to reflect your inner world accurately. Add “subpixels” to track variations on your mood along the day!
**Emotion Diary**: Use tags to input your emotions and feelings. Create custom tags to track other things like activities, habits, medications or anything you'd like!
**Reflect About Your Day**: Dive deeper by adding notes, letting you record thoughts, events, or personal reflections on your day.



WHY PIXELS?

Pixels empowers you to understand your moods, emotions, and mental well-being.

**Statistics and Graphs**: Gain insights into your emotional journey with beautifully crafted statistics and graphs that provide a bird's eye view of your mood patterns.
**Enhanced Mental Health**: Track your mood variations and recognize trends, leading to improved mental health and a better understanding of your emotions.
**Visualize Your Progress**: Watch your mood chart evolve over weeks and months, providing valuable context for your emotional well-being.

Pixels has been highly recommended by mental health professionals as a powerful tool to complement therapy sessions and assist individuals in managing mental disorders such like anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder. By tracking daily moods, emotions, and related thoughts, Pixels helps users build a comprehensive emotional profile. This provides a valuable starting point for productive discussions during therapy, then enabling a more in-depth exploration. Furthermore, tracking mood variations over time with Pixels allows users to better understand their emotional patterns, by exercising simple and proven mindfulness practices.

Pixels is not a replacement for professional help, but it's a valuable companion in the journey to improved mental well-being.

WHO IS BEHIND THIS PROJECT?

Pixels is an indie app developed by just one person! You can learn more about me and Pixels at www.teovogel.me



DOES PIXELS HAVE ADS?

Pixels does NOT show ads while you are logging your mood, emotions & more. The idea is that the app can be a space for you to reflect about your day without distractions.
Pixels does NOT show you annoying screens with ads, nor does it push you to buy a premium feature.
You can watch optional ads to support the project and the developer!



WHAT ABOUT PRIVACY?

Privacy and transparency are at the core of Pixels design and values, and will remain forever.
Your data is stored locally and it is NOT shared with any other parties.
You can also protect your pixels by adding a password to the app!

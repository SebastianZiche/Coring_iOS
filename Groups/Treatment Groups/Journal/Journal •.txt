A clear mind can help us calmly navigate through the chaos of life. But to achieve a clear mind, we need to sort out our thoughts. It can be difficult task, so that's why we built Turtle.

BENEFITS OF JOURNALING

Journaling works because it helps you organize your thoughts, realize what's important, and clear your mind of junk. This makes decision-making and progress easier.

However, maintaining a journaling habit can be challenging at times. You may not feel like writing or exploring a certain topic, or you may simply forget to check-in. That's where Turtle comes in as your superpower. It goes beyond traditional writing to offer drawing, voice recordings, and the ability to add photos and videos. You can also play peaceful sounds to create a calming atmosphere and set personalized reminders to ensure journaling becomes a lifelong habit.

Sometimes our thoughts make it harder to reach our true potential. Fear and worrying can keep us safe from real danger, but it can also stop us from doing amazing things. Imagine a world where Michelangelo let a fear of heights stop him from painting; or imagine if 12 year old Justin Bieber let a fear of public singing stop him from making music. This world would be a lot less lively and fun. We believe everyone can make the world a better place in their own unique way, and the first step is to make sure nothing holds you back. That's why you should journal.

PRIVACY

Turtle's private journaling experience acts as a sanctuary for the mind. As a result, we do not store your journals on a remote server. Instead, everything is kept on your device and only accessible by you. Uou can also add a passcode or biometric lock to restrict app access on your device.

PREMIUM:

While Turtle is available download and use for free, some features require a subscription. Please see in-app for further information.

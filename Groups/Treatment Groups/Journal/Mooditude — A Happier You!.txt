FEEL BETTER WITH MOODITUDE
You can easily incorporate Mooditude into your daily routine. It requires just a few minutes a day. Here is how:


STEP 1 — Take a Mental Health Test
It takes just 3-minutes and produces your overall risk of mental health conditions. Our mental health test combines four tests into one:

• Depression Test
• Anxiety Test
• PTSD Test, and
• Bipolar Disorder Test

You can also download a complete report explaining your depression, anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar disorder risks and recommendations. You can take this report to your therapist.



STEP 2 — Follow a Personal Self-care Plan
Based on your responses to the mental health test, we personalize a self-care plan. Your self-care plan consists of two or three short self-love activities.

These self-help activities include:

• Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and DBT 
Worksheets
• CBT / DBT Thought Diary or Journal
• Mood Tracking and Mood Monitoring
• Meditation and Mindfulness
• Coping activities, e.g., PMR, Grounding games.
• Uplifting mental health quotes and affirmations
inspire. Explore shows you'll love from entertainment
• Mental Health Programs to learn new skills and 
manage:
relationships, work-related stress/burnout, 
self-care, trauma, and self-esteem.


STEP 3 — Mental Health Monitoring and Tracking
We all know what gets measured gets improved. Mooditude's Mental health trackers help you discover what triggers your emotions and feelings.

1. A clinical-grade mental wellbeing tracking with 
mental health screening
2. Regular mood tracker, and
3. Lifestyle activities trackers, including:

• Exercise or physical activity level
• Quality of Sleep
• Mindfulness & Focus
• Social interactions
• Gratitude Mindset
• Exposure to sunlight
• Medicine / Medication
• Alcohol or Durg Usage (Substance Abuse)
• Period or Mensuturation Cycle Tracking

These trackers produce powerful insights, for example:

• What triggers your mood and emotions?
• What are your top cognitive distortions?
• What activities, e.g., journaling or meditation, 
works for you?
• Does talking to people improve your day? Or,
• Going for a short walk after lunch improves 
your energy?

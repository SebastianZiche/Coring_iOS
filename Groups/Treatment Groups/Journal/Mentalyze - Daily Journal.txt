App Description
Knowledge is the key to changing your life.

Mentalyze allows you to plot out your entire year one pixel a day. Color each pixel according to the mood that best represents that day. At the end of the year, the entire chart will be filled and you can either reflect on a certain day or month or begin to notice patterns concerning your mood.

Reflect and answer questions such as: how many days a year am I happy? How many bad days do I experience? Is it linked with the weather, work, health?

Most importantly, how can you make your year better? Mentalyze makes it significantly easier to learn more about your patterns and habits.

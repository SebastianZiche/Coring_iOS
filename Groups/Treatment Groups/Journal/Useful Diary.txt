→ Recommended for both people who want to write in short sentences and look back on the day in long sentences!

【List of Functions】
● Calendar
It is easy to look back because the mark is attached to the day when you wrote the diary on the calendar. You can view, write, and edit the diary of the date selected on the calendar.
In addition, the calendar can be switched between weekly display and monthly display with a button. You can expand the viewing range of the diary by weekly display.

● Photo registration
You can register photos in your diary. You can change the saved image quality of the photo on the setting screen. If you want to focus on the image quality of your photos, you can set it to high quality mode, and if you want to save space, you can set it to save mode.

● Theme color setting
You can set a theme color that changes the screen color. We offer eye-friendly colors such as light blue, beige, green, pink, and gray.

●Reminder
You can prevent forgetting to write your diary because you will be notified on time. The notification time can be decided freely.

● Passcode lock function
It is a passcode lock function that also allows Touch ID (fingerprint authentication). You can write a diary safely and securely without worrying about being seen by others.

● Edit and delete diary
You can edit or delete the created diary by swiping left.

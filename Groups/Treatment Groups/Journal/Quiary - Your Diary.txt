App Description
Quiary is your digital diary.
Sadly our memory is not perfect and with every day, memories tend to fade away or we alter them without even recognising. Quiary can help you not to lose your precious memories. Create one entry a day, set your mood and describe the events and your thoughts. By this way you can preserve your past and use it for the future.

- Write one entry per day and set your mood
- Search through all entries in the "lost and found" section
- Remember by swiping through the images of the day
- Setup a daily reminder
- Choose your color
- Save your backup on a place of your choice

!Your data in your hands!

All data is only saved within the app on your device. This means nobody can get access your data without accessing your device. You decide when you create a backup and where you save it.

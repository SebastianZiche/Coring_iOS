Ooops it looks like we like dark mode a bit too much. This has been addressed in this release. There was a very specific error that was crashing the app for users in Thailand with their devices set to use the Buddhist calendar. Sorry about that Thailand. We love you! Last but not least we addressed an issue that was making the journal entries time to shift relative to the user timezone whenever the app attempted to sync with the server for users that are signed in. Welp dates and timezones are hard!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can now see everything you write on Tangerine on a timeline and that includes your habit notes and the things you write about your days when you track your mood. You can now also write down your thoughts as they pop up or explore one of our guided journaling templates. We hope you enjoy this update as much as we do! Our small team worked super hard to make this happen! Last but not least: thanks a lot for all the feedback you all have been sending over the past few months!

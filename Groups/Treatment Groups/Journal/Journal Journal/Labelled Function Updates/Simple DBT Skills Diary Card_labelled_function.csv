New Features for Everyone Instead of just working on a card day by day we included a Calendar for you to do your Diary Card for. This gives you not only easy access to doing a Diary Card for a day you missed but also quickly recap how you re doing from the Home Screen. 2 New Diary Cards That makes 3! . Unlock the 2 new versions as you progress. Stickers! Send DBT Skill stickers to your friends through Messages. Stats Stats lots of stats! This app integrates with our other DBT apps as well so you can easily see your DBT progress not only in this app but others as well! A Brand New interface with familiar modules. Want to try some of our other apps We ve included demo modules from our other apps. And if you use one of our tools and decide to purchase it later any progress you made from the demos will made accessible as well. New Features for Premium Users Better support for PDF generation. Share your stats with your Therapist or print it out for yourself. Want charts We got charts. As you know Premium Users get access to their full history which makes the Calendar that more powerful. Easily see your daily weekly and monthly progress as soon as you open the app. New Unseen Features for this and all our DBT Apps Internationalized... so expect new languages being integrated. Cross Platform support. So if you switch platforms your progress can be transferred over as well. Greatly improve developer experience. We ve rewritten this app and our other apps from the ground up so adding new content is much easier than before. This means that it ll be easier to make bug fixes and add new content than ever before. Automated Build System. So instead of it taking an hour or two to upload to the App Store it ll be a few keystrokes and grabbing a coffee while the computer does all the work of uploading a new version. So in the past we would hold off of making updates if there were just small changes that needed to be made because it seemed like a waste of time to spend an hour or two just for something as simple as a typo fix. Since the build system is automated expect quicker and more regular updates. Thank you to everyone who has supported us in the development of these DBT apps!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We ve added a new feature that allows users who have already filled out a card for the current day to be able to quickly and easily edit that card. No it s not as well thought out as the original card filling out menu is but it s something we ve been thinking about for awhile and finally decided to integrate. Let us know if you want more added to that feature. Since it s barebones it could use some work but I d rather not clutter it if it works fine as is. Other than that here s what else we ve added: New content added to PDF generation You can now generate your Daily Log AND your notes in a PDF . Also finally added the ability to Export and Import your data. That way if you switch devices or are going to restore your device to factory settings or you are just worried about your data you can manually export it two different ways!

With the release of iOS 9 a few new bugs appeared which were hopefully all squashed. Keep us in the loop if something didn t get fixed. Other than that probably the biggest new feature we re most excited about is Apple Watch functionality. If you own an Apple Watch or plan on getting one you can now do your Diary Card from your Watch. The best part about it is that instead of making this like the original card where you have to fill out the entire card in one sitting the Apple Watch app will let you go back and update the current day s card whenever you want. Not only that but the current day s data is synced between your iPhone and your watch. So whether you fill out a card originally using the iPhone app or the Apple Watch app you will always be able to keep working on it as you go! That s not the only great feature so here s a quick list of a few of the other ones: Optimization for iOS 9 Fixed some bugs like PDF Printing Added Support for Apple Watch Added a new Messages function so you can get messages while in the app about what s going on with updates and new apps Added a new Facebook button and built a FB Page so our users can communicate with us and each other about bugs new features ideas or just to say hi!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Paying users now have the ability to access a new section that stacks their personal stats up to other users as a whole . Find the averages that other people use other skills and learn some other cool statistics as well. Users who own our other DBT Apps now can access those apps from within this app by simply tapping the other app s icon. This provides a more streamline experience for doing DBT. The banner at the bottom also notifies users of which apps in our collection they own and which they don t.

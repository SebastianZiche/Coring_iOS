An idea that s been brewing for almost 3 years. Mineral is a simple Gratitude Journal designed to help you appreciate the positive moments in life both big and small. We are grateful that you have chosen to embark on a journey of gratitude with us. In this update we ve introduced a few improvements and refinements to enhance your overall app experience: Real time Date Headers: We ve fixed a bug to make sure the date headers are always up to date. No more confusion with entries listed as Today when they were actually from yesterday. The app now accurately differentiates between Today and Yesterday . Enhanced Input Field: We ve added a fresh shine to the input field for a delightful experience. New App Icons: To keep things exciting we ve introduced new app icons. Revamped About Screen: The about screen has been polished and tidied up for better readability and a more pleasant user experience. With these improvements we aim to make the app more user friendly and visually appealing. We hope you enjoy these updates as much as we enjoyed making them!,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

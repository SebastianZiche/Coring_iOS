We ensure that the default personal diary is always available. Updated options to be more visible in journal advanced settings. Fixed an issue where some settings were incorrectly disabled.

We re loving the trackpad functionality Apple recently added to iOS and added support for it in our last update. This update includes some tweaks and polish.

You can now quickly access a list of recent prompts by long pressing on the daily prompt in the new entry menu.

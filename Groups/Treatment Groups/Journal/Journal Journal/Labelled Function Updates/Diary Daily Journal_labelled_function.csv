I feel like it s a great thing to have a place where I can write without asking for understanding or sympathy. What has been updated The screen is now a little cleaner,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Humans aren t perfect but I don t think there s anything wrong with being human. What has been updated When a search results in no diary the user mistakenly assumes that the person who just installed it has no record of it and instead says Thank you for installing which is a habit of saying Thank you.

Everything you need is there and you don t see anything superfluous. I think it would be great if we could carefully examine each issue and prepare appropriate options.

However because I love seasoned seaweed there are some things I have to say with all my heart. I think seasoned seaweed should be called flavored seaweed not seasoned seaweed. If it is seasoned seaweed the main character will have to be the seaweed but if it is seasoned seaweed there is a possibility that the leading role will shift to the person who added the flavor. This is because we can feel the presence of someone who added the flavor to the seaweed by its name seasoned seaweed. Certainly it is also important to respect the existence of seasoners. However truly excellent manufacturing is also thought to be one in which the presence of the creator is not felt. When I m about to eat it I don t even think about the presence of someone adding flavor to the seaweed in front of me. It was as if seaweed already flavored had fallen from the sky without making a sound. It s as if the seaweed had been tinged with the flavor of sesame oil since before humans were born before their ancestors were born or even long before the origin of all life on Earth. This mysterious seaweed can be said to be the ultimate seasoned seaweed. What has been updated Added features that are not particularly useful but slightly interesting such as The word I ve used a lot recently is seaweed. Other updates Added slightly more interesting if not useful features such as On this day last month I wrote something like this The screen is now a little cleaner Fixed the problem of presence and absence,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However perhaps because I was born with thin fingerprints no matter how many times I try it never responds. For app developers this property is far from useful. You will be at the mercy of Touch ID every time you open your MacBook and you will be forced to accept a hopeless development life where the first step of every development task is the mentality that things don t go as planned. But for criminals for example this is not the case. Fingerprints can serve as conclusive evidence and can prevent you from being arrested. It will be an important quality that can mean the difference between life and death. Now given this fact I have two options before me. 1. He becomes the great villain of the century by committing crimes where fingerprints can be fatal. 2. Continue to develop as a small app developer despite being at the mercy of Touch ID This option reminded me of a story written in a book by a certain novelist. There are two kinds of lives where you live happily without reading books and a life where you live with books and become unhappy. No matter how unhappy you become it s always better to be able to read books. Isn t that obvious So every day I opened my MacBook and wrote a bunch of code after getting rejected by Touch ID. What has been updated You can now add images to your diary The screen has become a little cleaner overall. The code programming statements that runs this app has become much more beautiful. Fixed an issue where the screen lock might not work Fixed various other bugs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

From addition and subtraction reading and writing to differential equations and past subjunctive grammar. However as more and more time passes both while in school and after graduation I forget these things one by one. Suppose you end up forgetting everything you learned in school. It s a waste If there is anything that remains from that time it is education. That s what it is. What has been updated Added a feature called Learn Other updates Notifications can now be set You can now set the screen lock Now recorded on the previous day until 3am You can now rate only part of the day or leave a note.

I think it s because I used to think of history as memorizing the names and eras of old people that I don t really care about in order to get a good score on a test. However just because it s history doesn t necessarily mean it s boring. It s quite fun to bring up a friend s ex girlfriend and make fun of them by saying It seems like a lot of people hang out with quirky people. It s even more fun when it s someone else s problem If you think about it I think this is also history. Depending on the person the object of interest may be Imoko Ono a friend s ex lover Yuko the Nocturnal or oneself. In any case it doesn t seem to be a bad thing to have an interesting history. What has been updated The history of added deleted actions consciousness is now displayed. Other updates You can now press the Record button on the record list screen without scrolling. Added explanation You can enter what you do be aware of from the next day onwards Fixed the bug where An item with the same name exists was displayed when trying to re register an action consciousness that had been deleted. Fixed a bug that was conspicuously lame in that it was said that you could not create more than 5 things to act be aware of but you could do it the day before.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What's New

Version 1.4.3 (Feb 16, 2024)
    **** Enhanced end-to-end encryption. To enhance privacy and security, we've added the industry standard AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256-bit key to encrypt all your content before it leaves your device. This is in addition to the existing to using encryption via https as it goes over the network to our servers. Now all content is also stored encrypted. The only time it is used unencrypted is when it is processed (without metadata) via OpenAI's LLM models to generate summaries and new prompts.

    ... and tons of bug fixes and behind-the-scenes optimizations.

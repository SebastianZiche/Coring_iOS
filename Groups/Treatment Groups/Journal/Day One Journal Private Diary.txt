You can switch over to a beautiful new photo view when you’re ready to see your world at a glance.

Version 5.0.1 (Aug 9, 2020)
    In a year where news has been predominantly negative, we wanted to announce a bit of positive news from our corner of the world:Day One 5.0 is here and with it comes a number of new features and refinements we think make journaling even better.

    New:
    • Today: A complete reimagination of “Activity Feed,” Today aggregates five journal elements into one place: your location data, calendar events, photos taken, the day’s entries, and On This Day entries. Today provides an overview of where you’ve been and what you’ve done, allowing you to journal what matters most in a really convenient way. Today is also the most seamless way to revisit the past, with quick access to On This Day. You can access Today by tapping a date on the calendar, the date in the Timeline, or by tapping Today in the Journal Side Menu.

    • Media Picker: Adding photos and videos to your entries is easier now thanks to four key updates to the Media Picker:
    1. Easily toggle between your photo library, the in-app camera, and the video recorder to add photos and videos to your entry.
    2. We removed the related tab and now group the contents of your photo library by location and time of day.
    3. Now photos will be added to the entry in the order you select them.
    4. New zoom buttons and a favorites icon in the photo picker help ensure you pick just the right photo.

    • PDF Exporter: With Day One your entries always stay yours. We’ve rebuilt our PDF Export system to give you even more control over how you export your data.

    • Sign in with Apple: We’ve made it even easier for you to create your Day One account by adding Sign in with Apple functionality. Existing users who want the simplicity of Sign in with Apple can convert their account over for future authentication.

    • CSV Export: Now you can export your Day One data as a .csv file.

    Updated:
    • On This Day now shows a map of all entry locations from past years.

    - Bug Fixes
Version 4.15.2 (Jun 15, 2020)
    Fixed:
    • Made some small performance improvements to sync and made some changes under the hood to address some user-reported crashes.

    4.15.1 Release Notes
    We’re back again with a small but important update that ensures Premium users can continue to use our Instagram Importer tool.

    Updated/Improved:
    • At the end of June, Facebook will be deprecating the legacy Instagram API, which is what Day One uses to connect to Instagram. Due to this change, we’ll be using a new API to continue offering sync functionality. If you’ve connected your Instagram account to Day One before, you’ll be asked to re-authenticate once the new service is up and running.
    • We’ve updated our in-app camera with slightly larger image previews so you can spend less time squinting and more time snapping. Plus, the UI now has a slick new dark tone.

    4.15 Release Notes
    We’re dedicating this update to Leonardo Da Vinci, whose birthday was 4-15. Buon compleanno, Leo.

    Updated/Improved:
    • Whether you’re left handed, right handed, or ambidextrous like Da Vinci, you can now use the trackpad on iPad to select multiple entries to view, tag, or move entries using command + click.
    • More knowing, less guessing — we’ve added labels to each of the five tab menu options so you always know what’s what.
    • If for some reason the server doesn’t know about a journal on your device, we’ll prevent you from being able to hide that journal until it has been properly synced.
    • When selecting multiple entries on iPad, card view now includes a button that will enlarge the entry to fill the main entry area.
    • Your collection of Daily Prompts are works of art, and now we’ve added a dedicated filter so you can quickly see them all at once.

Version 4.14 (May 20, 2020)
    Our palindrome update is officially here. To celebrate, we’ve used some “race car” language throughout the release notes.

    New:
    • Sometimes you make an edit in your journal entry you’d like to undo. You can always shake your phone to undo text or tap the backspace key, but now you’ll have the option of using the convenient little undo button we added inside the text edit menu.

    Updated/Improved:
    • Granting permissions is essential to making Activity feed run like a well-oiled machine and now it’s even easier to do, right inside the Activity Feed Settings.
    • Speaking of well-oiled machines, we got under the hood to give sync a tune up, boosting reliability, performance, and speed.
    • To save you time tapping, we added a new button in the selective sync settings to select/deselect all of your journals.
    • Sync wasn’t the only feature with a need for speed— the app itself now launches even faster.
    • We’re loving the trackpad functionality Apple recently added to iOS and added support for it in our last update. This update includes some tweaks and polish.
    • Here’s the scenario: you love the new Daily Prompts but the day got away from you and you forgot to respond to the prompt of the day. You can now quickly access a list of recent prompts by long pressing on the daily prompt in the new entry menu.
    • A minor note for major PDF export improvements we have underway: we’ve disabled the option to add monthly map pages to books.

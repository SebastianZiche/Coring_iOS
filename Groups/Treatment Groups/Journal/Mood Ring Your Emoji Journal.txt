App Description
All the feels — sometimes we have ‘em. Two things help: Noticing patterns in your emotions and reaching out to people you trust who care.

Mood Ring will help you do both so you can feel like your best self. Track your feelings, get weekly Emotion Reports, and reach out when you need to talk.

Designed and developed by teens at Youth Radio!

“It’s like Fitbit for your feelings” -Jeff Daniel, CEO, and co-founder of Starmaker

"The Mood Ring app could be a great way for young adolescents to learn that feelings are transient and that 'this too shall pass.'" - Stacy Sterling, DrPH, MSW
Staff Scientist at Kaiser

JOURNAL YOUR FEELINGS WITH EMOJI
-Mood Ring puts the power of your feelings into your own hands.
-Choose emojis to track a combination of feelings.

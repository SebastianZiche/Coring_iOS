App Description
As of the 20th century AD, there were about 100 billion people living on Earth. Only one million have left even a single name.

Another 99,999,000,000 people have not left a single trace, as if they had never existed.

How did they spend their lives?

Who did they love? What kind of pain and happiness did they experience?

In the vast space of the universe and the constant scale of time, no one is more important than anyone else, and no achievement is more important than the life journey itself.

We believe that everyone's life story deserves to be saved, and we hope that 10,000 years later, there will still be people who can feel our lives in the story.

It is the goal of the Ever Journal to do everything possible to preserve the true life story of each individual human being to the greatest extent possible.

What's New

Version 3.5.2 (Dec 28, 2023)
    # What's New
    Have you spent time creating beautiful templates, but struggle to easily share them with your friends? Or maybe you've come across someone else's template that inspired you, but manually setting it up is too much of a hassle? No need to worry anymore! Grid Diary now offers template export and import functions, making it a breeze for you to achieve all of this.
    And that's not all - you can also conveniently share the settings of your entire journal. Rest assured that your content won't be leaked, as the exported file only includes the journal cover and category template, not the entries inside.
    To get started, simply long press on the journal on your home page, then select "Journal Settings" from the pop-up menu. Scroll to the bottom and tap on "Export Journal Settings". Share the generated file with your friends, who can then import and use it on their devices with Grid Diary installed. Give it a try!

    # Outras Atualizações
    - Corrigido o problema da posição incorreta do cursor ao inserir texto
    - Corrigidos erros na redefinição de senha e e-mail
    - Outras correções de bugs e melhorias de estabilidade

Safety and Privacy

We stand out as a trusted personal journal, and here's why: we don't touch or access your data.

At Pink Piko, honesty is at the core of what we do. While your data is stored in the cloud, we don’t share it with anyone, nor do we have access to it. This ensures your information stays private. The data within the app is safeguarded and can't be reached by other apps.

With Pink Piko, journaling is both easy and confidential!

Remember, with Pink Piko, it's not just about tracking — it's about growing, learning, and cuddling with your emotions. Let's make emotional fitness as comforting as a purring cat.

Friendly reminder: Pink Piko is all about self-awareness, but if you're feeling really down, always reach out to a professional. We're here to support, not substitute.

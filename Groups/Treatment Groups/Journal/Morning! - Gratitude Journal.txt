Make gratitude a habit
Lifestyle (Applications)
Free
App Description
It only takes 5 minutes a day to be happier!

Use Morning! - Gratitude Journal to conveniently practice gratitude from your phone! Answer the daily questions, set reminders, and read your past entries. Turning gratitude into a habit has never been easier!

~~~~~

More and more science is proving that practicing gratitude on a daily basis will noticeably help increase both your state of mind and quality of life. Being grateful helps us focus our attention on what we have instead of what we don't. And when we fill our minds with positive thoughts, there isn't any space for negative ones!

"Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend."
- Melody Beattie

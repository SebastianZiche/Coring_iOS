App Description
** Developer Spotlight - Apple (2021) **
** App of the day - Apple (2020) **
** Best of the month - Apple (March, 2020) **
** New apps we love - Apple (2020) **
** Apps for Self-Care - Apple (2020) **

Tangerine is your guide to daily self-care. Form habits, track your mood and journal. All in one app.

** TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF **

Start putting you first — physically, mentally and emotionally. Improve your overall wellbeing and be happier through better self-esteem and less stress.

** FORM HABITS THAT LAST **

Forming lasting habits can be hard, but we're here to help. As part of your self-care journey, Tangerine allows you to create and track habits while reminding you to do them and celebrating your achievements.

** TRACK YOUR MOOD **

Mood tracking is a technique in positive psychology that includes the tracking, recording, and analysis of a person’s mood. With that in mind, Tangerine not only helps you reflect on your days, but also realise what activities in your life make you happy or sad.

** JOURNAL, REFLECT AND LOOK BACK **

Journaling has become a hallmark of the self-care movement. It helps you prioritize and clarify thinking, but most importantly it gives you a boost in mindfulness, memory and communication skills. In addition to tracking your daily mood, on Tangerine you can write down your thoughts as they pop-up or leverage one of our guided journaling templates.

** MEASURE YOUR PROGRESS WITH THE POWER OF DATA **

Get insights & stats on your routine and on how much you've evolved with elegant and comprehensive reports.

Tangerine integrates with the Health app in order to automatically complete health related habits.

** DON'T BE SHY, SAY HI **

Do you have any questions or suggestions on how we can make Tangerine even better for you? Get in touch at hi@bitdreams.co.

App Description
Take a moment to reflect on your day. Capture and write about the details of everyday moments and special events using photos, videos, audio recordings, places and more. Journalling suggestions make it easy to remember your daily experiences, so you never have to start with a blank page.

Get started writing with journalling suggestions
• View and add suggested moments that intelligently group outings, photos, workouts, media and more. Use the writing prompt to guide your insights.
• Get inspired with reflection prompts to focus on gratitude, kindness, purpose and more.
• Journaling suggestions are created using on-device intelligence based on how you use your iPhone. Choose what information you want to enable for suggestions.

Preserve powerful memories in rich detail
• Illustrate your entries with the photos, videos and places that tell your story.
• Record your voice or your surroundings to add even more context.
• Start a new entry and add content from other apps like News, Music or Safari.

Look back on past moments
• Browse and filter your journal to look back and reflect on key moments in your life.
• View each entry and its attachments in a beautiful fullscreen view.

Keep your journal private and secure
• Protect your journal with your device passcode, Touch ID or Face ID, so no one but you can access it.
• Store your entries safely in iCloud so they’re automatically backed up.
• Your suggestions are private and only what you select will be shared with the app.

Build a good habit
• Set a schedule and receive notifications to keep a consistent journalling practice.
• Get a notification when new journalling suggestions are ready.

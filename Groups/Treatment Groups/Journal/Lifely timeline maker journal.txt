App Description
WHAT IS LIFELY

Lifely is a diary with lock that allows to track achievements, significant memories, milestones and other important moments in a simple and convenient form of a single timeline, while performing a minimum of actions. The app instantly synchronizes with the server and uses reliable data encryption algorithms to protect your data.

HOW IT WORKS

Lifely provides the ability to quickly look back and navigate events and dates. This is achieved by zoom and scroll capabilities. With just a few gestures you can easily time hop to any period of life. There is an ability to track events both in a general timeline or any other stories you've created (for example, business, travel, family etc.).

SECURITY

Lifely is a super secure diary, that guarantees lifetime safety of your data. Just use Apple sign in and your memories will remain on our servers forever, even if you reinstall the application or change your device. All your data is strongly encrypted. The encryption algorithms are so flawless that even our developers do not have the technical ability to read someone's data, no matter how much they want to.

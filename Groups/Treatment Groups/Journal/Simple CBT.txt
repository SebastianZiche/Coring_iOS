A Minimalist Thought Journal

App Description
Simple CBT is a minimalist cognitive behavioral therapy journal to help people become aware and break free of negative thought patterns.

Simple CBT main features at a glance:
- Minimalist design
- Earn fun badges
- View top distortions
- Share your entries
- Supports dark mode (and light mode)
- All your journal thought entries and app data is stored locally on your device

Simple CBT was built with a clear design to help you worry less and live more. By using a simple 6-step process, you will quickly be on your way to being more mindful. This will help you to become mentally prepared to overcome daily anxiety, depression, and stress. To assist you to stay motivated and build a healthy habit, you will earn badges for hitting milestones. These badges also help to promote gratitude which can improve happiness. The more entries you add, the more insights you can gain from seeing which cognitive distortions you are commonly falling into. To make the process easier when you are pressed for time or too caught up in the moment, there is a draft feature which allows you to start creating an entry and save it at anytime to be completed later. In the event that you are working with a therapist, and they would like to have a copy of your entries, you can export each entry as a PDF to share. If you were worried about your data’s privacy, worry no more as all your journal thought entries and app data are stored locally on your device so there is no cloud storage to worry about.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice. While CBT is most effective in treating people with anxiety or depression it could also help with:
- Panic
- Stress
- Phobias
- Schizophrenia
- Sleeping Disorders
- Eating Disorders
- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD)
- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders (OCD)
- Bipolar Disorders
- Sexual Disorders

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is something that everyone can benefit from and can be done without this Simple CBT app such as by using a diary and following the steps. With that said, if you believe you can benefit from using this app but don’t have the money to afford it, please reach out to us at simplecbtapp@gmail.com.

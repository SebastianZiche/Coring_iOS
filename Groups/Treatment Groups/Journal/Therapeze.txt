App Description
Like many others who embarked on a therapeutic journey, we understand the importance of processing and reflecting on your therapy sessions. Our app is designed to provide you with a secure and private space to record your thoughts.

With Therapeze, you can effortlessly capture the essence of each therapy session, allowing you to revisit and reflect upon the topics discussed, breakthrough moments, and valuable insights.

Features include:

End-to-End Encryption: We utilize encryption technology to ensure that your notes remain confidential. Only you, with your unique password, can access and decrypt your information.

Therapy Notes: Document your thoughts and reflections after each therapy session. Capture the insights, breakthroughs, and emotions you experience during your therapeutic journey. Our intuitive interface makes it easy to write, edit, and organize your notes.

Meaningful Quotes: Store quotes that resonate with you or words of wisdom your therapist has shared during sessions. These quotes can serve as sources of inspiration and encouragement.

User-Friendly Design: Navigate through the app effortlessly with our user-friendly interface. The home screen offers a quick overview, while the session notes and quotes screens allow you to delve into your content with ease. Designed like a therapy journal, Therapeze makes it easy to keep track of your notes.

Reflection and Growth: Use Therapeze as a tool for self-reflection and personal growth. Revisit your notes to gain insights into your progress over time, helping you recognize patterns, milestones, and areas for further exploration.

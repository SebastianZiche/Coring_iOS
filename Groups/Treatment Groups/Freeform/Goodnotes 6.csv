Stickers stamps headers sticky notes basic shapes graphs coordinate systems... When taking notes we need to use the same objects over and over again. The new Elements feature lets you import and save objects or groups of objects to a collection from where you can add them to the page again. No more copy and paste between different notebooks or hectic redrawing when time is short. SAVING ELEMENTS GoodNotes comes with some built in Element collections that you can use to decorate or enhance your notes. Of course you can also add your own elements: 1. Select something with the Lasso Tool tap on the selection again tap Add as Element 2. Select an image with the Image tool Then tap on it again Add as Element 3. Open the Elements picker tap and hold on the mini thumbnail of a collection at the bottom Edit Import images from Camera Roll or Files INSERTING ELEMENTS Inserting elements work similarly to inserting images with the image tool: Select the Elements tool tap anywhere on the page select the Element you want to insert. You can also use drag and drop to add elements from the Elements picker or from the contextual area that includes your recently used Elements for faster access. Tips for Pros: When you save an Element the format is preserved which means all objects are fully editable when you add them back to a page. For example you can save a hand drawn table with placeholder text boxes for the table headers. After adding the Element to the page you can update the placeholder text with the text tool or erase columns you don t need. ORGANIZING ELEMENTS Elements are organized in collections. When saving an element you can choose to add it to an existing collection or create a new one. You can delete Elements in collections move them around and import more. You can learn more about how to use Elements by visiting our blog on medium.goodnotes.com and following us on Instagram goodnotes.app and on Twitter goodnotesapp .

Previous release notes: Study With Flash Cards GoodNotes lets you create flash cards that you can study with the Spaced Repetition learning technique. To create a flash card add a new page using the Flash Card paper template Flash card paper is currently only available in the size GoodNotes Standard Size and can be found in the Essentials template group all the way on the right side Add the question on the top half and the answer on the bottom half. Tip: Use images text and handwriting to create great looking and information rich flash cards. To study all flash cards in a document the flash card deck tap on the ... menu and then on Study Flash Cards Tap on the screen to reveal the answer and then choose how easy it was to remember the answer. GoodNotes will suggest your next study date based on your learning progress and the selected difficulty of the cards. The more you study the more accurate these suggestions will become. E.g.: You will see hard cards more often and sooner than easy cards. You can reset your entire learning progress for the current deck in the settings in the flash card studying screen. Note that this is not reversible and the entire progress for this deck is lost as if you would have never studied it before. Other fixes improvements added a dialogue for when there are incompatible sync versions installed that isn t blocking you from using GoodNotes Fixed crashes related to the new shape and text features Fixed the multi selection gesture for the library and page

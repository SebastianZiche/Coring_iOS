App Description
Use Whitelines App when you want to:
・Capture your notes.
・Save your notes.
・Share your notes on Social Media, email, etc.
・Continue to work and edit your notes digitally.

The Whitelines App will capture your notes automatically when it detects all four corner codes on your Whitelines Paper and adjust the image to make it useful to you.
When using Whitelines Paper the app removes the background, so all that remains is your writing or drawing over a white background.

Whitelines App is perfect when you want to:
・ Review your notes on the go before an exam.
・ Share notes from a class with a friend.
・ Include a handmade drawing in a presentation.
・ Post an illustration or note to Instagram.

CAPTURE YOUR NOTES WITH WHITELINES APP
1. Tap the camera icon to enter capture mode. Whitelines App will capture your note automatically when it detects the full page (including all four corner codes), with the logo at the bottom of the page. Or, if you use other than Whitelines Paper tap the button to scan the note manually. Before scanning, choose between “Auto” or “Manual” to tell Whitelines App to remove the background automatically or to edit the image yourself.
2. If you have several pages of notes that you’d like to save as a stack, simply stay in the capture mode and continue to capture pages one at a time. Of course, you can also save your notes to existing stacks in the app.
3. Save, Use, Edit and Share the Notes

Choose if you’d like to save your note locally on your phone, or if you’d like to share it–with yourself or with somebody else. You can share your note with any app that processes image files, such as WhatsApp, Instagram, OneDrive, OneNote, Google Drive, Evernote, Dropbox, Line, Facebook installed on your phone. Tick the boxes on the Whitelines Paper to email the note or save it to Dropbox or Evernote.

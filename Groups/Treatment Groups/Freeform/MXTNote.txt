App Description

document idea fragments, then we expand our knowledge structure
by creating links between these fragments, or add more content around them.
MXTNote provide ways to simplify some of these steps

Here are some examples:
- A PDF references another PDF, you can select the two location and link them.
- After embedding a selection from PDF to notebook, a two way link is automatically created between PDF and notebook.

Fixed: The Tags add remove interface introduced some new bugs in the recent version update. Fixed: The logic that keeping vertical center position while typing which caused potential cursor displacement jitter. Fixed: Resolved the issue where multiple clicks are required for the Zen mode background to take effect on the desktop version. New: Added support for selecting font for PDF exporting on the desktop version. Fixed: ghosting when rendering the contents of the file manager in the latest OS. Fixed: the problem caused by the previous versions incorrect cursor position offsets in code highlighting and in the Meta window. Tweak: Since Metion 3.5 has been released for a long time we have adjusted the logic of synchronizing and replacing old versions of documents. If the old version of a document does not have the mdate attribute it will be compared with the modification time of the local document to determine the mdate value so that the document can be synchronized with the documents after version 3.5 automatically without being placed in the historical version again. Tweak: iPad version displays the header when cursor moves to item and it is hidden.

A better looking interface a more natural interaction logic further optimization for iPadOS and likewise a more iPhone compliant form on the iPhone. We ve rewritten almost all of the interface and in addition to that the underlying data logic is better. For example the new syncing mechanism which it should be noted will only be used for articles edited by the new version of Metion others will be saved as history versions and not automatically merged by syncing.

In addition we are optimistic that the real Mac version of Metion will be released in May but if that doesn t work out we think we can finish this first release in June. Important storage and synchronization adjustments For a more robust data and experience the new Metion uses a dual storage mechanism of Local iCloud . iCloud Drive is only used as a synchronization tool. The old user will have a data migration after updating to the new Metion copying data from the iCloud side to the local side. If there are too much iCloud documents not synced to the local side the subsequent use of Metion will also automatically complete the sync. But because the iCloud sync mechanism is OS controlled it may require Waiting Patiently ...... Due to the mechanism of iCloud Drive itself Metion may not be able to complete cross devices synchronization in time and the dual storage mechanism of Local iCLoud will lead to some old data duplication requiring users to perform repeated operations mainly delete move rename operations on different devices this is a probabilistic issue that generally does not occur and even if it does it is acceptable considering the stability of the data. If you need to use Metion s original mechanism of using iCloud Drive as the only storage directory please use a directory on iCloud as the external work folder for Metion a new feature of Metion . New Features Redesign for the Settings Panel Support for automatic parsing of unordered and ordered lists for conversion of Mindmap Optimization of custom shortcuts and interface support for custom sorting Support iPad Touchpad New Directory and New Document operations on the folder list when right click Expanded table syntax cell merge effect Wiki style document link syntax Support for searching across working directories when searching for documents in full text if the keyword starts with Create external work folder mounting in working directories list Support for moving work folder to under another work folder as a normal subdirectory Support moving ordinary subdirectories to the root storage directory of the whole App to become work folder . Add Word count statistics in the top menu Add a new setting to allow or not allow the use of content templates when creating new documents Adjustments The Trashbox is moved to the Settings Panel and the button of creating directory is moved from the top to the bottom. Adjusted the default shortcut bar iPhone side added parenthesis exclamation mark vertical line separator In link related syntax use iOS standard interaction to handle open document and open URL operations when current text is selected When saving the history version if the content is the same as the last version it will not be recorded repeatedly Switching between visual themes using a lighter popover interaction Adjust the startup mechanism if the document crashes during startup the next startup will avoid loading the document. Bug Fixed In the reference syntax block the link related syntax is not clickable Text was not stored in some cases in focus writing mode When exporting as a Mindmap if the page width is too large it will be displayed as a blank page The document list is not refreshed when the document restored from the Trashbox belongs to the currently selected directory If there are Tags in the directory list the last position for new folder is fixed to the penultimate position,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

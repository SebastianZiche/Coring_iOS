It s been one of our most requested features and we ve spent months working with our testers to get it just right. Layers are like stacked pieces of transparent paper. You can draw on them independently you can merge them rearrange their order hide or show them and change their opacity. Layers create a safeguard for your work so you can change individual parts while preserving the rest. For example you might sketch something with pencil on one layer then draw over the top with ink then hide the original pencil sketch layer completely. You can also bring that layer back if you want to start again. FLOW WEB VIEWER You can now view your Flow documents in your web browser! Just login with your account at flowapp.moleskinestudio.com to check it out. PRESSURE CURVES You can now choose from four different Apple Pencil pressure curves along with the corresponding influence that the curve has on your drawing. You can easily access this by the Gesture Settings button along the top right. HOVER If you have the latest iPad Pro with Apple Pencil you can now see a preview of your strokes when hovering. PEN SIZES We ve added WAY more pen sizes. Bigger. Smaller. We ve got it all. PANNING You can now pan the canvas further off screen when zoomed making it easier to position your work where you want it. PERFORMANCE There are some big performance boosts in this release reducing latency and load times even more. MARKER TOOL BLENDING The chisel marker and round marker tools now apply their ink additively to the page so when you draw with multiple passes the colour remains the same but increases in strength whereas previously these tools would darken the page as you drew over a spot multiple times. PENCIL CASE If you haven t already tried Pencil Case it moves your tools to your iPhone screen so you can have an immersive experience on iPad. We ve streamlined the Pencil Case layout to be clearer and we ve added Layers so you can dedicate your iPhone to controlling them giving you more real estate on iPad. Give it a try by opening Flow on both devices side by side and watch the magic happen. SELECTING When using the Lasso you can now just tap to select objects rather than having to draw around them. You can toggle whether your selection comes from the current layer or all enabled layers. With an active selection you can choose a different layer and tap Move to current layer to reorganise your document. If you want to select everything tap and hold on the Lasso Knife in the tool dock. ROTATING AND SCALING Objects now have handles which allows you to scale from corners or from the centre. The new rotate handle allows more accurate spinning goodness by showing the degrees of rotation. You can turn on Snap by tapping the magnet icon to lock moving along an axis shown by yellow guide lines . Rotation will be locked to 5º increments. IMAGES It s now easier to use images in your documents. Just tap an image with the Lasso to see the new images editor with options for editing opacity resetting rotation or replacing the image with another. TIMELAPSE Our timelapse feature is unique because you can open any of your documents and retroactively create an awesome timelapse video from it. We ve added a great new setting where you can choose whether it s created based on time strokes were drawn or based on the layered order of them bottom to top . We ve also tweaked the GIF export so it repeats the last frame so it highlights the end result. We love sharing Timelapse GIFs on Instagram so be sure to tag us moleskinestudio when you post there. INTERFACE We ve made countless improvements to the interface see What s New in the app for all the details. THANK YOU!

We ve added a great new setting where you can choose whether it s created based on time strokes were drawn or based on the layered order of them bottom to top . We ve also tweaked the GIF export so it repeats the last frame so it highlights the end result. We love sharing Timelapse GIFs on Instagram so be sure to tag us moleskinestudio when you post there.

It s been one of our most requested features and we ve spent months working with our testers to get it just right. Layers are like stacked pieces of transparent paper. You can draw on them independently you can merge them rearrange their order hide or show them and change their opacity. Layers create a safeguard for your work so you can change individual parts while preserving the rest. For example you might sketch something with pencil on one layer then draw over the top with ink then hide the original pencil sketch layer completely. You can also bring that layer back if you want to start again. FLOW WEB VIEWER You can now view your Flow documents in your web browser! Just login with your account at flowapp.moleskinestudio.com to check it out. PRESSURE CURVES You can now choose from four different Apple Pencil pressure curves along with the corresponding influence that the curve has on your drawing. You can easily access this by the Gesture Settings button along the top right. HOVER If you have the latest iPad Pro with Apple Pencil you can now see a preview of your strokes when hovering. PEN SIZES We ve added WAY more pen sizes. Bigger. Smaller. We ve got it all. PANNING You can now pan the canvas further off screen when zoomed making it easier to position your work where you want it. PERFORMANCE There are some big performance boosts in this release reducing latency and load times even more. MARKER TOOL BLENDING The chisel marker and round marker tools now apply their ink additively to the page so when you draw with multiple passes the colour remains the same but increases in strength whereas previously these tools would darken the page as you drew over a spot multiple times. PENCIL CASE If you haven t already tried Pencil Case it moves your tools to your iPhone screen so you can have an immersive experience on iPad. We ve streamlined the Pencil Case layout to be clearer and we ve added Layers so you can dedicate your iPhone to controlling them giving you more real estate on iPad. Give it a try by opening Flow on both devices side by side and watch the magic happen. SELECTING When using the Lasso you can now just tap to select objects rather than having to draw around them. You can toggle whether your selection comes from the current layer or all enabled layers. With an active selection you can choose a different layer and tap Move to current layer to reorganise your document. If you want to select everything tap and hold on the Lasso Knife in the tool dock. ROTATING AND SCALING Objects now have handles which allows you to scale from corners or from the centre. The new rotate handle allows more accurate spinning goodness by showing the degrees of rotation. You can turn on Snap by tapping the magnet icon to lock moving along an axis shown by yellow guide lines . Rotation will be locked to 5º increments. IMAGES It s now easier to use images in your documents. Just tap an image with the Lasso to see the new images editor with options for editing opacity resetting rotation or replacing the image with another.

Previous Updates v2.9.2 Improvements to onboarding experience. v2.9 In this update the Recent Documents widget can now show on your iOS16 Lock Screen. Flow also now supports the new iOS16 Focus Filters so you can filter which collections are visible in the app at particular times of day or when you re in particular locations e.g. show your Work collections when at work and your Personal collections when at home. This is configured on iOS16 in the Focus section of Settings. v2.8.4 Improved drawing latency and fixed a bug causing lag when drawing for some users v2.8 This update is all about zooming and navigating your documents. Zooming Zooming out on your documents is a highly requested feature that we are excited to get into your hands! It s great for seeing a broader context of what you are working on as you can now see more on screen at once just by pinching out. To get back to normal size just zoom the document to near the screen size and it ll automatically snap back into place or tap the new reset zoom button at the top of the screen Panning Document Edges Working on the edges of your document is much easier now when zooming in you can pan the edges to the middle of the screen for more ergonomic drawing. We ve also refined panning when you are zoomed in so it s more precise. Pages Along with this great new feature we ve also added an additional page divider style which visualises your document as a strip of individual pages. You can still seamlessly draw across the edges as before this is an optional viewing mode. Scrubber Options We ve added new options for when the document panning scrubber appears. You can now choose if the scrubber shows when zooming in when panning or not at all. We ve also used our shrink ray to reduce the size of it a little and in vertical documents it not longer replaces the tool editor when shown. Other updates We ve improved the top menu. It now accomodate the system button on iPad with a blank space in the center. The pasteboard button has moved to the left and a new reset zoom button has been added on the right. On both iPad and iPhone the top area of the screen now changes dynamically to keep the buttons legible as your document content moves behind them.

Zooming Zooming out on your documents is a highly requested feature that we are excited to get into your hands! It s great for seeing a broader context of what you are working on as you can now see more on screen at once just by pinching out.

We ve also refined panning when you are zoomed in so it s more precise. Pages Along with this great new feature we ve also added an additional page divider style which visualises your document as a strip of individual pages. You can still seamlessly draw across the edges as before this is an optional viewing mode. Scrubber Options We ve added new options for when the document panning scrubber appears.

SHAREPLAY Flow has pioneered collaboration in a drawing app and with SharePlay you can now automatically share a Flow document while on FaceTime. Strokes appear in realtime so it s just like sharing a piece of paper wherever you are. To use SharePlay ensure all devices have been updated to iOS 15.1 or above and when on FaceTime just open Flow and follow the prompts. If other participants do not have a Flow membership they will still be able to collaborate with you whilst on the call. Special mention to our tireless Adam D who has spent many hours on FaceTime calls with himself whilst in the testing phase of the SharePlay feature. Adam1 please remember Adam2 is probably not real but we hope you created some wonderful art together. PEN SETS Pen Sets is a huge new feature we are really excited to get in your hands. It s a simple and powerful new way to use pens in Flow that will improve how you work and create. Instead of a single dock of pens you can now create multiple sets of pens and quickly swap between them. For example you can now curate a set of pens for taking notes and another set for colored pencil sketching and swap between them with either a gesture or the new Pen Sets button on the Pen Dock. You can create multiple set of pens with a range of colors for easy access. Flow will remember which of your Pen Sets you were using for each document and automatically switch to the last set you were using as you move between documents. On the Pen Sets screen you can swipe between all your Pen Sets create new ones and edit them. When editing you can add a name for the Pen Set and re arrange the pens within it. You can tap on each pen to edit it individually. You can also delete duplicate and drag pens between your sets. You can even share Pen Sets with other people by sending them a special link. Sharing is caring right NEW EYEDROPPER We ve improved both the eyedropper and quick color grid tools. In fact they ve merged Voltron style into a more powerful tool than you can possibly imagine. The new eyedropper icon on the Tool Editor replaces what was previously the Quick Color Grid button. Press and hold on it to instantly activate the eyedropper. When the eyedropper is active the Tool Editor changes to display a redesigned color grid with a range of shade and tint variations on the current color. You can drag over these to select one or drag over the canvas or pens to pick a new color. The eyedropper itself now displays as a ring with one half showing your existing color for comparison. IMESSAGE STICKER APP Draw your own custom set of iMessage stickers from Flow. When you save selections from your documents into the pasteboard they automatically become available in the new Flow iMessage app. Your stickers are synced between devices so you can create them on your iPad and send them from your iPhone. ENHANCEMENTS Delete items from the pasteboard by tapping the new delete button Refinement of icons and button spacing through the app Adjusted the size of the tool editor Pen opacity control now displays in the ink color Highlighted tools and menus now use a higher contrast black and white scheme Pen Dock layout fine tuned for smaller devices Timing improved so selecting tools is more responsive Range of greys increased in tool editor Pencil Case interface refined BUG FIXES Fixed an issue that could cause the Pen Opacity control to not respond to first tap Lots of other minor fixes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Choose a PDF from Import Files then select any page to place it on your Flow document. Boom. Tool opacity control. You asked for it and here it is! The new slider on the toolbar and tool editor controls the opacity of the selected tool. Setting it lower will decrease the strength at which the tool applies ink on the page. Correction Pen Eraser. We ve rebuilt the Eraser! Instead of having two modes it is now two separate tools making it quicker and easier to use. Choose the Eraser for when you want to remove entire strokes or images choose the Correction Pen when you want to partially trim or cut into strokes and images. Graphite Pencil tool opacity now responds more rapidly to Apple Pencil pressure. Airbrush refined to suit the capabilities offered by the new opacity control. Improvements to tool response time. Thumbnails for your documents are now based on your last edit position instead of last viewed. v2.3: This update adds another great new function: the curve line. When the ruler is active tap the line button under shape options on the left side and choose curve. You can then create whatever curve you need by moving the control points that appear on your ruler. The curve line also works when the ruler is set to mask mode. We ve also been hard at work under the hood tuning our drawing engine technology. This update contains significant performance improvements to make drawing feel even smoother and more responsive. If you use Flow for writing you ll notice it feels quicker than ever before. v2.2: We are super excited to release one of our biggest features ever and the most requested say hello to the Ruler! We thought long and hard about design of the Flow Ruler and the result is a whole new take that you ve never seen before. We think you re going to love it! It s all about empowering you to draw quickly and precisely from simple lines and shapes all the way up to sophisticated multi point perspective drawing. Here s a few things you can do with it: Draw straight lines and precise angles Draw perfect circles ellipses squares and rectangles Snap the ruler to background patterns for extra precision and spacing guidance Use masking to shade inside and outside shapes as well as along straight lines Turn on advanced reference lines for 1 2 and 3 point perspectives Also in this version Flow now has a shiny new App Clip.

Choose a PDF from Import Files then select any page to place it on your Flow document. Boom. Tool opacity control. You asked for it and here it is! The new slider on the toolbar and tool editor controls the opacity of the selected tool. Setting it lower will decrease the strength at which the tool applies ink on the page. Correction Pen Eraser. We ve rebuilt the Eraser! Instead of having two modes it is now two separate tools making it quicker and easier to use. Choose the Eraser for when you want to remove entire strokes or images choose the Correction Pen when you want to partially trim or cut into strokes and images. Graphite Pencil tool opacity now responds more rapidly to Apple Pencil pressure. Airbrush refined to suit the capabilities offered by the new opacity control. Improvements to tool response time. Thumbnails for your documents are now based on your last edit position instead of last viewed. Let us know what you think and remember we build what you ask for just go to the Menu Help Request Feature. Previous updates v2.3: This update adds another great new function: the curve line. When the ruler is active tap the line button under shape options on the left side and choose curve. You can then create whatever curve you need by moving the control points that appear on your ruler. The curve line also works when the ruler is set to mask mode. We ve also been hard at work under the hood tuning our drawing engine technology. This update contains significant performance improvements to make drawing feel even smoother and more responsive. If you use Flow for writing you ll notice it feels quicker than ever before. v2.2.3: Fixes crash for some users when editing pen v2.2.2: Handles some rare error conditons v2.2: We are super excited to release one of our biggest features ever and the most requested say hello to the Ruler! We thought long and hard about design of the Flow Ruler and the result is a whole new take that you ve never seen before. We think you re going to love it! It s all about empowering you to draw quickly and precisely from simple lines and shapes all the way up to sophisticated multi point perspective drawing. Here s a few things you can do with it: Draw straight lines and precise angles Draw perfect circles ellipses squares and rectangles Snap the ruler to background patterns for extra precision and spacing guidance Use masking to shade inside and outside shapes as well as along straight lines Turn on advanced reference lines for 1 2 and 3 point perspectives Also in this version Flow now has a shiny new App Clip.

This is a powerful new feature that makes it quick and easy to make reusable drawings which can be easily selected overlapped and rearranged. To use grouping simply tap the chain icon once you make a selection. You can ungroup by tapping the broken chain icon. VISUAL CLIPBOARD There is a shiny new icon in the top bar say hello to the visual clipboard. Your most recent items that have been copied to the clipboard will appear here making it quick and easy to copy complex selections especially between different documents. Just tap an item to insert it to your active document. COMING SOON We are working on an awesome new feature that starts with R and ends in ULER. We can t wait to bring it to you and will be sharing more details soon. v2.0.3 Fixed a crash seen by some of our users v2.0.2 Improved gesture support. General polish fixes. v2.0.1 General polish fixes. v2.0 REALTIME COLLABORATION: With Flow 2 multiple people can work on the same document at the same time from separate devices wherever they are in the world. It s a truly groundbreaking way to collaborate now more than ever. We had architects who wanted to mark out designs with their assistant who s based on the other side of town. Employers needing to collaborate with their staff that are working from home. Grandparents wanting to color in with their grandchildren remotely. VERTICAL DOCUMENTS You now have the option to choose a vertical document if top to bottom infinite canvas works better for you than side to side infinite canvas. You choose orientation when creating a new document and this cannot be changed once set. PENCIL CASE MODE We want Flow to disappear when you re using it so we invented Pencil Case mode to give the option of taking your tools away from your iPad screen entirely and putting them on your iPhone instead. It separates the artistic and utilitarian sides of your creation so you can have a clean space to work without the clutter of your tools. You simply place your iPad and iPhone side by side open Flow on both of them and through magic or rather some very clever coding your tools are shown on your iPhone. Just make sure you are signed into the same Flow account on both devices. IMAGES You may have noticed we quietly launched this recently but now it s ready for everyone. Here s what you can do: Add images to your document from Photo Library or Files including iCloud Dropbox Adobe Creative Cloud Box OneDrive Google Drive Amazon Take photos directly in Flow and then draw on top of them Paste images from your clipboard even from your other devices like Mac using Universal Clipboard Drag and drop to grab images from other apps Use the Lasso Knife tool for rotating resizing and moving your image Duplicate images to save you from adding the image again Change the opacity by using the long press menu MORE All new sync engine performance and stability are better than ever thanks to our all new sync engine built from the ground up. Flow on iPhone now opens documents in read only mode so it s easier to navigate without accidentally drawing. Tap and hold the pen icon to open your tools. Clipboard copy lasso selections to your clipboard and paste into other Flow documents.

Employers needing to collaborate with their staff that are working from home. Grandparents wanting to color in with their grandchildren remotely. Here s how it works: Tap the collaboration button on any document and share the link with who you want to collaborate with You ll get notifications when someone is editing You can use FaceTime picture in picture so you can chat while you collaborate For bigger groups you can broadcast your collaboration via Zoom VERTICAL DOCUMENTS You now have the option to choose a vertical document if top to bottom infinite canvas works better for you than side to side infinite canvas.

It separates the artistic and utilitarian sides of your creation so you can have a clean space to work without the clutter of your tools. How does it work In a nutshell it takes your tools and creates a Pencil Case in your phone. So you draw on your iPad and your tools are on your iPhone.

General polish fixes. v2.0.1 General polish fixes. v2.0 REALTIME COLLABORATION: With Flow 2 multiple people can work on the same document at the same time from separate devices wherever they are in the world. It s a truly groundbreaking way to collaborate now more than ever. We had architects who wanted to mark out designs with their assistant who s based on the other side of town. Employers needing to collaborate with their staff that are working from home. Grandparents wanting to color in with their grandchildren remotely. Here s how it works: Tap the collaboration button on any document and share the link with who you want to collaborate with You ll get notifications when someone is editing You can use FaceTime picture in picture so you can chat while you collaborate For bigger groups you can broadcast your collaboration via Zoom VERTICAL DOCUMENTS You now have the option to choose a vertical document if top to bottom infinite canvas works better for you than side to side infinite canvas. You choose orientation when creating a new document and this cannot be changed once set. PENCIL CASE MODE We want Flow to disappear when you re using it so we invented Pencil Case mode to give the option of taking your tools away from your iPad screen entirely and putting them on your iPhone instead. It separates the artistic and utilitarian sides of your creation so you can have a clean space to work without the clutter of your tools. How does it work In a nutshell it takes your tools and creates a Pencil Case in your phone. So you draw on your iPad and your tools are on your iPhone.

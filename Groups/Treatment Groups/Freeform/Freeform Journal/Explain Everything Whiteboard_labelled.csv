It is a dedicated more affordable offer for teachers and educators. It lets them use Explain Everything on their own with no limits. So if you d like to create videos and have your personal media powered whiteboard this one s for you. The Solo Teacher plan features unlimited projects with unlimited slides no restriction to video recording length and 5 GB of Explain Drive cloud storage. The new plan is a yearly subscription and it comes with a 7 day free trial if you haven t used it already . Alongside the new plan we ve also renamed the Individual plan to Pro. This is to better reflect the difference between the two plans. If you re already on a paid plan don t worry it will all function as it used to. Last but not least the recording length limit for the Free plan is now 3 minutes. We felt that the previous 1 minute limit was too short to explore the recording possibilities.

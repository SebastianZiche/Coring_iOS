App Promotional Text
Whiteboard app has been carefully crafted through more than ten years of iteration and is now selected as one of the top ten featured teams on the AppStore.
App Description
The Whiteboard App always adheres to the concept of "simplicity to the extreme" and "Nothing more Nothing less". Despite offering many small tools, its interface remains simple and user-friendly.

This app is suitable for various scenarios, including teaching, creativity, meeting presentations, prototype design, and learning drafts, among others. It provides users with a variety of universally applicable paper formats, objects, and prototype designs to choose from. It also offers instant drawing of geometric shapes, making teaching, creativity, and on-site communication more convenient. Additionally, it can be used for students' homework drafts, doodling, note-taking, temporary notepads, word dictation, and math problems, among other purposes. Users highly praise its simple and easy-to-use button layout and tool exit mechanism.

The app offers two forms of creating new files, allowing users to choose the one that suits them best:
- The first form is a multi-page file (Pages), where each page serves as a canvas with size limitations, similar to a PDF file. This makes it easy to organize knowledge.
- The second form is a free-form file (Free Form), where a file consists of one infinitely large canvas without boundaries. This allows for unlimited creativity.

The app also supports direct import of PDF files, even large files with hundreds or thousands of pages, without crashing. It opens instantly.

Features:
- Small storage space
- Simple operation
- Clean interface
- Quick startup
- Rich functionality

Welcome to download and experience the Whiteboard App as soon as possible!

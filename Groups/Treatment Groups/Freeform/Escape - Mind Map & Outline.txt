App Description
Escape is your place to jot down notes & ideas, connect and develop them, and get things done.


WHAT'S YOUR NEXT IDEA?

• Jot down & Collect
Notes, images, links or tasks, drop them all in a mind map. Start an outline for an organized, structured view, and switch to mind map to visually rearrange ideas or add new ones.

• Plan & Organize
Information is ever changing and your app should help you stay on top of things. Rearrange, edit, merge or highlight with intuitive gestures. Instantly switch between outline and mind map. Focus on details by unfolding branches.

• Style Your Mind Map
Create expressive maps with beautiful automatic layout, intuitive markers, Apple Pencil sketches and various text styles. Your mind map looks perfect out-of-the-box.

• Get Things Done
Turn ideas into tasks and projects. Prioritize, sort, group and add task completion percentage.

• Share and Collaborate
Easily share your maps with others as image, text, PDF or MMAP. Collaborate on tasks with non-mind mapping users, by exporting the map as PDF with clickable checkboxes.

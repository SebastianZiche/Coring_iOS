Thanks to your continuous support and feedback Concepts is actively growing and evolving. As we enter our sixth generation design phase we hope you ll appreciate our commitment to exploration flexibility and your creative pursuits. We think our new logo and style reflect that and we re glad to have you on this journey. Completely rewritten the Gallery is now optimized for file and folder based workflows interchange with the Files app and ready for our final push towards iCloud sync. On first launch we ll automatically migrate all of your drawings from Project Section Drawing to Folder Subfolder Drawing. Some drawing names may have numbers added if they re not unique as required by the filesystem. A new collapsible sidebar displays top level folders in the Concepts directory on your iPad iPhone plus a special section for Recently Deleted drawings. You can create as many folder and subfolder levels as you like. New grouping and sorting options are available and remembered across folders. Notes are saved straight to the folder as Notes.txt. Pinch to zoom the Gallery to see more fewer drawing thumbnails. You can now share drawings directly from the Gallery via tap hold. You can now access and manage drawings directly from the Files app. Our next and last! step towards iCloud will be built on these changes. The Canvas now adapts more efficiently to your drawing workflow. We hope you appreciate how key interactions are more fluid and less hidden. The status bar has been split into sections to free up central canvas space provide quicker access to import export and better adapt to both smaller screens and resizable app windows. New buttons are easier to hit and don t interfere with the most recent system navigation gestures. Importing is a critical part of many workflows so it s been separated from Objects and sits on your status bar. This requires one less tap to reach your photos PDFs clipboard etc. Clear up more space on your canvas by hiding the Precision Layers Objects menus entirely via the new Actions section at the top of your screen. A new Measurement popup activates by tapping the canvas zoom rotation button on the status bar. Here you can access zoom presets selection measurements and lock unlock zoom rotation options. You can now input measurements of varying systems imperial metric percentages etc and they will automatically be converted to your workspace s unit system. As a special birthday gift to you we ve added not one but two new color systems! Explore the full spectrum of color with HSL Hue Saturation and Lightness sliders. RGB sliders are an ancient favorite made new in Concepts 6. Tap the slider labels to enter specific values. We ve also fixed a ton of little issues we ll post at concepts.app roadmap. Please note that you ll need iOS 15 or greater to run this update. Thanks for all the feedback and encouragement thus far and keep it coming! We re glad you re here with us.

Tap hold the vanishing points to quickly adjust them or tap the Grid layer to enter edit mode which now works for all grid types . Added one two and three point perspective grids. In the Precision Snap settings activate Align to Grid to lock your strokes into perspective this already works on other grid types . There s also a new useful option to Allow Turns while drawing. Edit your grid by tapping the Grid layer in the Layers panel. You can also get there through Settings or with a tap hold on a vanishing point. Grids can now be rotated right on the canvas. New settings for adjusting the grid line weight and confining the grid to the artboard. Grids are now visible in Focus Mode. Other changes: Refactored gesture handling. This is part of the work to unify the code across platforms. As a result we ve fixed a number of bugs and the gesture handling is now much more robust. Improved file handling. This fixes edge cases around saving drawings with low storage space. Continuing work for iCloud on the backend. No visible changes yet but a lot of progress under the hood. We fixed a bug while exporting incorrect colors for PSD. Your PSD exports will again look the same in other apps as they do in Concepts! Instead of hiding the Shape Guide option it is now greyed out when not supported by the active tool. We removed support for Pogo Connect and Pencil by 53 styli as they have not been updated for years. We wish them happy retirement! We have dropped support for iOS 12.4 and moved to a minimum requirement of iOS 13. This streamlines our development process and simplifies supporting new features.

In case you missed it the Grid is now a movable layer layers names can be hidden and layer selections are easier to work with. Check out the full list of changes on our app page. Fixes a few crashes and bugs around layer interactions e.g opening layer list while drawing with Apple Pencil9. Fixes a crash when tapping on canvas while editing a shape guide and other gesture related issues. Fixed a bug where switching background foreground while saving a drawing caused a crash on rare occasions. No data was lost in the testing of this crash thank goodness.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many fixes and updates in prep for iCloud. Improvements: Grid is now on its own layer. You can move it up and down the layer list. It s now possible to change the layer while having an active selection. This makes it easy to switch between layers and add more targetted strokes to the selection. Layers that contain selections are now highlighted and have a selection arrow icon on top of the thumbnail to make it easy to locate which layers have active selections. Layer names are hidden when using the compact UI to maximize the working space. Swipe inwards outwards on any of the buttons Layers Precision Export Import on canvas to toggle the mode. Layers in focus mode are now highlighted with a focus mode icon. Double tap a layer to enter focus mode and double tap again to exit it. Or scrub your finger on the visibility icons next to the layer thumbnails to quickly scan through the layers in focus mode. Layer options can now be used in focus mode and while you have an active selection. Tap the active layer to open the popup and you can e.g. select everything on the layer. Adjusting the opacity of locked layers is now possible. A lot of changes under the hood in preparation for iCloud Sync cross platform support. Fixes: Fixed layer thumbnail shaking when adjusting the layer opacity Fixed a bug that made it possible to have a drawing with no layers Fixed the layer thumbnail sometimes flashing when finishing a stroke Made a change so that locked layers are fully locked. It s not possible to paste import add objects or add text to a locked layer Zoom and angle information is now available in the iPhone status bar. There were some other layout issues there too which are fixed. Fix for imported images being stretched when exported to SVG or vector PDF if the images had been taken on a device with a different display density. Exporting a selection as SVG was also exporting all imported images inside the drawing. It no longer does that and only exports what s actually in the selection. Fixed a bug where changing the brush of a stroke drawn with snap to grid made the stroke disappear. Improved rendering of Slice and Nudge pucks. Improvements on crash reporting and debugging. This makes it easier for us to fix issues while still protecting your privacy. Fixed a purple flash when opening drawings on the newest iPad Air and iPhone Mini. The 5.9 series will be the last to support iOS 12.4. Please update to iOS 13 to continue enjoying the latest Concepts.

This update focuses big time on performance we ve transitioned to Apple s Metal graphics API so that rendering is snappier than ever. You ll find battery life is longer drawings load faster ink flows smoother and your sketches appear like lightning as you pan and zoom around the infinite canvas. Our under the hood changes also pave the way for awesome features coming up. Details matter so we ve added some handy extras: A new Recently Used dynamic color palette gives easy access to the last five used colors in a drawing including any you ve picked from photos or dragged in from other apps. Tap hold the color dot to find the palette in the Colors menu. Now drag drop multiple images onto the canvas! Making mood boards and adding reference images is a lot faster now. Updated the logic of selections made via the Layers menu. Selecting everything on a layer now behaves exactly the same whether done with layers or the Selection tools. Moving the artboard is now an undo able action. If you moved it by accident undo it on purpose. Text in the gallery now responds to iOS dynamic text size so that if reading drawing titles matters to you you can do it without spectacles. Find this under your device s main Settings General Accessibility Larger Text. We disabled the idle mode when presenting. Your iPad will no longer automatically go to sleep when you are presenting in Concepts. And a few of those pesky bug fixes: Fixed a bug where the off screen arrows pointed in the wrong direction to the off screen content. Fixed a bug where the corner target points for selecting an image were wrong if the image was rotated. Fixed a bug with snap points showing in the wrong place. Fixed a crash that occurred in some cases when exiting to the gallery after deleting a PDF. Fixed a crash in presentation mode. Fix for the broken Key Point snap targets. Fix for a crash when painting with watercolor on a non textured background. You might notice this update is for 5.5.1 in switching trains our gallery caught the wrong line and headed the opposite direction. This speedy addendum puts the gallery back on the fast track.

This release contains bug fixes and stability improvements as well as some future proofing for those in the vanguard.

In this release we have improved the behavior of the Shape Guides to give your sketches and designs more precision: You can now rotate the shape guides precisely via the angle metric in the status bar. When you have a shape guide active tap hold on the angle value at the right end of the status bar. Enter your desired angle or choose from the presets offered. No need to toggle snap on and off anymore to get your lines and rectangles aligned! You can now disable rotation and scaling when adjusting the guides with the drag handles. This allows you to control the shapes much more precisely. The shape guides are included in your subscription or are available for purchase in the store with Essentials. Other changes in this update: We now show a notification when a selection is duplicated. The duplicate appears on top of the original selection and no longer has an offset. This allows a more precise workflow. Improvements to the notification system. Stability fixes. We d love to hear what you think about Concepts.

This makes configuring preferences easier if you re just getting started. We also introduce a new Halftones brush pack. These new brushes emulate the aesthetics of offset printing and let you play with the old styles in a modern way. The brushes available in the Brush Market are included with your subscription or available for purchase as a pack. In addition we have fixed some stability issues and a couple of bugs. Setting finger action to do nothing no longer disables the tap hold gesture. You can disable tap hold separately via the Gestures tab in Settings. Fixed a bug where imported text was transparent if the active tool was Selection Nudge Slice or Pan. Fixed a bug where saving custom brushes occasionally failed when saving a drawing. This resulted in a crash for a handful of users but is now fixed. Thanks for finding these bugs. Let us know if you find any others have any feedback or would like to suggest a new feature.

In this release we introduce a new on canvas notification style that will be less obtrusive and streamlines your workflow. As an example these notifications will tell you when you are trying to draw on a locked layer or if you are trying to move a locked stroke. We have also done some work under the hood to prepare for things to come. This won t affect your drawing experience except for a healthy 10 speed up! Other changes in this release: New artboards are now auto centered on the screen and auto zoomed to show the entire artboard Added zoom level snaps at 10 and 25 A small tweak to make deselecting strokes easier Fixes a bug where item picker turned strokes invisible when touching them in focus mode Fixes rendering of gallery thumbnails for drawings that are in focus mode There are some very cool things on the horizon stay tuned to ConceptsApp on your favorite channel for updates.

Ideal for editing drawings and notes Slice destroys everything in its path. Use it like a razor blade to trim lines or incise them in two or as an eraser that actually erases your strokes. True to its name Slice cuts strokes apart and destroys what it touches. It divides the vector core of every stroke and trims the outsides of any fill. Note that some brushes like watercolor interact with nearby strokes so if it doesn t seem to work aim for the middle or try picking up a piece and moving it. Slice doesn t work on images yet but we re thinking about it in case you have an opinion. Sliced strokes and fills turn into independent new strokes and fills so you can pick up the pieces and manipulate them separately. Magic tricks anyone You can filter the affected strokes by active all layers ignore include locked strokes and ignore include masks. The only way to reverse Slice is to Undo. You can use Nudge to stretch things back out again though. You can find Slice in the Brushes menu under Tools it looks like a razor blade. You can set Slice as a Finger or Double Tap action while using an Apple Pencil. Other awesome stuff: Concepts now live renders as you pan zoom if you have a somewhat recent device and relatively small drawings stroke wise . This is great for keeping your reference as you move around. Excellent now and will get better over time. Added an option to disable the tap hold gesture specifically for Apple Pencil i.e. you can have tap hold work with your finger but not with Apple Pencil . It helps if you do a lot of detail work. Fixed HSB color showing wrong values for some COPIC colors. The Entire Drawing export option now uses the original image PDF bounds if the image PDF contains the entire drawing. Onboarding for new users is completely new. You can also see it by tapping the What s New button in the Help screen.

It s about maths and b splines and how everything is 10x better than you re used to. Read on. You re probably aware that Concepts uses vectors i.e. math underneath every stroke you draw. That s how you can manipulate things without losing clarity. With this release those vectors called B splines in our case are now fully optimized on the fly as you draw. We call it the Curve Fitter: New drawings will store one tenth of the point data. Old drawings aren t affected in any way. New drawings will load render and export much faster. Even when you have tons of strokes and you zoom around a lot. Especially noticeable on older devices. There should be zero difference in the way Concepts feels while drawing. We went to great lengths to make sure your brushes look and feel exactly the same as before. Vector exports SVG PDF DXF are much improved so if you re importing to other vector based apps like Illustrator AutoCAD or your favorite CNC machine you can enjoy cleaner vectors and improved compatibility. Some other things we ve included: The canvas UI is now cleaner and faster than ever. New gesture options for tap hold and 4 finger tap. Added some basic PPI settings to help manage export sizes. Hidden layers are now ignored completely when exporting your drawings. Automatically adapt the artboard to image and PDF imports via the gallery. Reveal type brushes can now lock the grain in place allowing for clean pattern type brushes.

Be more playful or precise. Stick to the basics or sketch a new universe. Create customize and share your own brushes. On a basic level our new brush system allows you to: Use your own custom PNG shapes and textures to create awesomely flexible brushes that reflect your style and add dimension to your work. Choose between a traditional stamp based stroke that creates discrete stamps as you draw and a reveal type that uses the stamp to unmask a background texture grain . Adjust _spacing_ how far apart stamps are from each other _rotation_ whether the stamp follows your drawing path or stays static or how far each stamp rotates from the previous one and _scatter_ how far away from the center line stamps deviate plus a variable degree of randomness to each one. Customize the brush name and icon boring but important . Share brushes or packs with other people account team sharing required . There are a few advanced features we think you ll appreciate: Tune the pressure curve tilt and velocity variance _of individual properties_ to your input device and preference. That means ink can react to pressure or pens that streak as you go faster or any combination you dream up. Add up to nine 9 different stamps to a single stroke. In our testing this randomness really enhances the quality of the brushes and it s something that s not possible in other more expensive programs. Our lovely pencils use this already and you can imagine how sprays or particle brushes might improve with a tiny bit of chaos... Assign your brush to draw in a specific layer automatically when using Automatic Layering . Remember despite the appearance these brushes are vector based so you can tweak and shape and manipulate anything you draw with them anytime. Check out our tutorials on YouTube Medium for more info. If you use the Basic free version of Concepts you ll continue to get our full updated basic kit for free new pressure sensitive pen! . Upgrade to the Essentials Pro Pack to make your own brushes. We ve also made a number of our own brush sets available for purchase separately and if you ve subscribed thank you they re all included. LIVE SMOOTHING Your strokes now smooth as you draw them and adjusting smoothness after the fact should feel a bit smoother. Go ahead try some lettering. Or straight lines at 100 . Smooth right GALLERY The more you create the more you have. And that deserves some attention. SECTIONS are here to separate drawings within a project. If you re presenting to a group client you may want your Finals displayed while your WIPs are hidden or you may prefer to see drawings grouped by date or by function. It s all possible collapse them move them rename them... enjoy them. PINCH TO ZOOM and see more of your drawings at once. iPads can display anywhere from one to ten columns at once and iPhones can show up to five. This helps you find things quickly but is also a handy way of presenting just expand your drawings to a single column and scroll down with a singular focus. MULTI SELECT DRAWINGS to more easily manage them in the gallery iOS 11 style tap hold drag one drawing then tap other drawings with another finger to add them to your selection and drag them just about anywhere. Even the Files app for quick backup! As you can see this is another massive update and as it s our first iteration of Custom Brushes we d love your feedback drop an email to concepts tophatch.com or find us on social ConceptsApp. If you re feeling especially generous leave a nice 5 star review in the App Store and let us know!

In this version 4.6.1 we ve fixed a number of bugs and improved stability. Generally speaking though that makes for a pretty unexciting update status. So here are a few more things: Updated the Wacom Adonit and Pencil by FiftyThree SDKs with better support for the iPad Pro. Added a preference to disable canvas rotation. Objects you create and use are now inserted at their original scale independent of zoom . Since you ve read this far here s a secret: We re working on something big and it s so big you might call it Concepts 5.0. It ll be landing sometime this Fall and if you re paying attention on Instagram and Medium ConceptsApp you might see something more. As always we love your feedback and five star reviews.

Two new PENCILS one hard one soft are natural and expressive and can apply tilt based shading and pressure response when used with Apple Pencil. The new SOFT ERASER is a separate tool that softly masks whatever you want traditional style. The SIZE CONTROL is now non linear making it a bit easier to hit small sizes accurately. While we re talking Apple Pencil we sorted out GESTURE SETTINGS so you can choose a separate action for your finger like panning selecting erasing drawing the default or ignoring finger touches completely. It only works on iPad Pro but it s a really fast way to work. There are some new PAPER TYPES that include brown paper and something rippled. Last but not least GALLERY SORTING can move your oldest drawings to the bottom or the top sort them alphabetically or you can continue to drag them into your own order. Tap the sorting icon in the Gallery status bar to begin. Will there be more You bet there will.

It will still appear when there is nothing to be found hopefully only then . LAYERS: Fixed an issue with layer names being truncated when renaming them. STYLUS: Fixed a case where strokes drawn with Apple Pencil would misbehave and disappear. They will now stay right where you put them on the canvas. If you re still having issues be sure to check your smoothing settings. STYLUS: Fixed an issue where on some devices Wacom styli would stop drawing mid stroke.

That not only brings a new yet familiar look but a sharper experience that improves on everything we ve introduced since 3.0 so you get the flexibility and focus you expect from a professional tool. Now Easier to Use: We consolidated the most used tool options into one menu that s ever present and ever useful. No more switching back and forth between Precision Mode Tool and Adjust menus. More favorite tool spaces now 5 to save you valuable thinking time. We also added a dedicated selection tool in addition to the tap and hold anything option if you re feeling traditional. The COPIC color wheel is bright and beautiful and accessible in context. We split off contextual settings into a separate collapsible menu called the HUD or Heads Up Display in the top right corner . They exist when you need them but stay out of your way. Things like live measurements snap selection preferences etc. Tap any layer to start working immediately or re enable automatic layer selection in that new HUD. Selection is better thanks to speed improvements and a more intuitive pin system that better describes what your options are. If you re careful you can now draw directly on top of the shape guides which is really useful for starting out at one handle and going to the next with accuracy . More New Features: Custom brush sizes! Larger ranges! Use a quick slider to change with a preview or tap and hold the button to type in your own size. You can fully customize your background color from the Settings menu. View Only Mode! Tap the currently active tool to disable it after which one finger movements will pan around the awesomely infinite canvas. New training experience. Again. We ve also updated our online support http: concepts.tophatch.com support with videos the manual picture walkthroughs and FAQ. In the Gallery: We now display the creation and modified dates tap to toggle . New author and location fields. You can tap either of these to override them with something custom useful for recording a job site or event for later reference. To enable automatic location recording tap the crosshairs when editing. Added a special Me section with some juicy stats and gives you the option of getting to know us better. Adobe Updates: Big thanks to Adobe for fixing PSD exports. We have temporarily disabled import of images from Creative Cloud Market while Adobe works out some gremlins. You can still import anything you ve already downloaded from the normal Creative Cloud route. Make with Ponoko: If you like to make things you ll be excited to know we ve teamed up with Ponoko: the World s Easiest Making System to laser cut your drawings. The process is iPad easy: Simply sketch your design in Concepts upload it to Ponoko then hold your baby in your hands. Visit http: concepts.tophatch.com ponoko for more details.

Fix a bug relating to offset drawing on an adjusted layer. Added an SVG Filterless option for improved reliability when exporting to Adobe Illustrator. Added some new double tap actions to the precision tools. Double tap the center crosshairs of the straight line tool to limit the drawn stroke to between the handles while the arc and angle tools now snap to equidistant and 90 degrees respectively. Double tapping the ellipse and rectangle tools already snaps to full circle square. We added a slight delay to single finger moving of precision mode handles so you can start drawing directly on the handle. It may take a little getting used to but we think it lowers the learning curve and offers you some enhanced control of your start and end points. If you like these updates and are feeling generous please leave a nice review! It s both helpful and motivating. Our next update will address many of the UI issues you ve sent us feedback about.

To use it turn on Precision Mode and Snap then start sketching! Smoothing Adjustments are now available via slider. Select any stroke or group then slide to remove slow stroke bumpiness or reduce to a straight line. Strokes look better and cleaner drawings equal cleaner vector and CAD exports. Combined with Snap to Sketching you can now quickly and accurately sketch floor plans circuit schematics line diagrams or anything that requires precision. Sketch them out and sharpen them up... all with your finger. Performance Enhancements. Rendering time has been reduced by 2 3x making the app much more responsive with larger drawings. Notable fixes include printing support web sharing of SVG files a few crashes and black can now be a favorite color. Not sure how we missed that one. Your feedback is important to us.

Move and rotate hide and reorder copy and delete any stroke at any time. Lengthen or shorten a line without changing its width... or change everything after its drawn even pen type color and opacity. Strokes is as fluid as your thoughts. Not only can you edit every stroke you can edit multiple strokes at once. Since working with thousands of strokes can be intimidating we intelligently create Stroke Groups . Move edit add or mask groups like they re layers. Only they aren t they re better. You can find Strokes in the Pro Shop. NOTABLE EXTRAS After your initial load of each drawing drawing load time is cut by 50 ! Precision Mode can now be enabled disabled with a simple two finger tap. We added a tiny delay to the handles of the Shape Guides so you hopefully don t move them by accident. If you do still manage to move them undo now supports shape and guide changes. We added a tiny instruction video to better explain Precision Mode. You know for us visual thinkers. Fixed every known crash condition.

Bugs: Fixed a crash condition when using the text tool. Fixed a crash condition when switching between active precision shapes. Fixed a bug dealing with stack ordering and remembering where they go. In iOS7 the status bar would show while picking an image from your photo library. Fixed. Fixed a bug where images in the gallery could show up late to the party if zoomed out and scrolling quickly. Tweaks: Scrolling performance in the gallery is significantly improved especially on devices with low memory looking at you iPad 3 . When leaving a drawing the gallery now goes to full scale regardless of where you were when you started. This should make it faster to perform duplications deletions etc. We now append a copy number to the titles of duplicated sketches. Added an instruction page for Stacks After a double tap on the eraser for clear all we ll automatically switch to the last used tool since you don t have any strokes to erase. With the exception of the center point the straight line tool no longer drags when you place your finger on the line. It draws. Allow a single finger tap to dismiss the precision guides if far enough away. Increased the size of the guide handle detection range so they should be easier to select. While 2.0 was a big release for us we feel the next releases are even bigger. We re doing a few things that have never been done before at least not in this form and we can t wait to show you!

Then we added new tools to take full advantage of those gorgeous colors: AIRBRUSH and MARKER. As will all our other tools they are beautifully realistic and scale with clarity. You can see each grain of paint in the airbrush and the marker layers with real opacity. Airbrush and Marker are included in the Pro Pack and we gave you a new DOTTED LINE TOOL for free. We re also proud to announce the addition of the new TEXT LAYER. You can fully manipulate move scale rotate color remove individual text elements and place them how you want them. And like the background layer before it you can hide the text when you don t need it. This is also included in the Pro Pack. Seriously great value. Gallery updates are coming soon but for now we tweaked it so it loads directly to your last drawing and is all around more responsive. Precision Mode tools are now less touchy most noticably with the Arc and Angle tools. We also improved the accuracy of the Ellipse tool specifically around sharp bends. We added in line instructions to both the Text tool and Precision Mode tools and for those of you who like to read a long set of instructions in the help section. We updated the menu scheme and tweaked menu interactions to work better. Lastly we fixed a crash condition when starting a new drawing before the rest of the drawings loaded and a bug where the guide clearing notification would activate without any guides.

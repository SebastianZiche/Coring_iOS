It is a modern digital notebook that lets you get the most from your iPad and iPhone. Use it for taking notes annotating PDFs sketching and doodling plus a whole lot more: Copy and paste from the real world: Use Inkport gen 2 to snap a picture of a whiteboard or writing and convert it into Noteflow s native vector ink. No special paper needed. Then resize re color or edit as if you wrote it in Noteflow. Create layered drawings without layers: Use the highlighter tool to color and shade behind existing ink. Use Color Select to separate and edit individual colors. It s a much more fluid and natural editing experience than with layers. Use the straight line tool with a grid for fast and intuitive wireframes and drafting. Drag and drop cloud storage and more: Noteflow natively integrates with iOS s file system and drag and drop capabilities. Drop photos and text into Noteflow and drag your drawings into other apps. Store your files locally or sync with the cloud service of your choice. Make Noteflow a seamless part of your workflow the way you like. SPACE FOR YOUR IDEAS TO ROAM Our vision for Noteflow is simple: to be digital pen and paper. The magic of pen and paper is in their versatility. They are useful for so many things but particularly for the freeform capture of ideas. Noteflow expands upon this quality. You can naturally do all the things you normally do with pen and paper: take notes in meetings or class and jot down flashes of inspirations on the go. And you can take that to a whole new level: One of Noteflow s best uses is for thinking on digital paper : quickly capture key ideas and concepts then move and organize them on the screen. Noteflow s vector ink engine lets you scale and edit your work without any loss of quality. Your words and drawings remain tack sharp when zoomed in giving you a huge effective working canvas even on a single page. There are analogues in the physical world such as sketchnotes or everyday working on a white board but being able to fluidly edit and move your ideas around the page is something you can only do digitally. When you represent the ideas in your head with your own personal scribbles on the screen it effectively becomes an extension of your mind giving you more room to think. We ve designed every part of Noteflow to let you intuitively capture and work on your ideas the way you like. Whether it s dropping in existing information quickly sketching concepts or assembling polished presentations for others.

DIGITAL TOOLS FOR A DIGITAL AGE I hope you ll find Noteflow a useful part of your workflow and that you ll discover new ways to do things with it that weren t easy before. We re very proud of the work we ve put into Noteflow but we re also just seen the beginning of what s possible with powerful new digital platforms like the iPad. Our goal is to push these platforms to their limits to craft useful tools. Tools that can help us think a little more clearly communicate a bit more effectively and connect with other in new and enriching ways. Thanks for joining us on this journey! The App Makers Qrayon.

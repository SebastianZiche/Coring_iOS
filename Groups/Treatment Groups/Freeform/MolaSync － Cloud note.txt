***** Really good surprise
by Artunczorlu - Version 1.0.2 - Aug 10, 2013
I wasn't aware of this app until now,when first looking in the appzapp without looking in the details,it's feel like another empty unnecessary note app with Dropbox sync that's what I imagine it but I give it a shot,open up and looking for a minute or so it was really great surprise. As an university student who takes note with iPad.This look promising -vector drawing-PDF annotation-Web clipping I would like to see an docs shelf and maybe performance tweak would be great. Using status bar empty space for naming to notes is cool too.

***** Great user experience
by Proteusca - Version 1.0.2 - Aug 15, 2013
A powerful design tool. It is very useful to record and share everyday's ideas in a friendly user interface. Collaborative editing is enabled, just like google doc, but it provides more editing tools. Hope in future it can supply specialized libraries and templates for different design purposes, such as floor planning, URL planning, network deployment, etc.

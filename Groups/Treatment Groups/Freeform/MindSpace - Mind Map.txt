Version 1.0.4 (Oct 6, 2021)
    This version fixes a bad problem: when two devices are online at the same time, MindSpace may overwrite the new data with the old data, so please be sure to update!

    Adjusted the default save location of documents and stored them in iCloud Drive uniformly. If you cannot find a new folder when synchronizing data, please restart the device.

    If you have any questions or encounter errors, please let me know, email: todo-color@outlook.com
Version 1.0.3 (Oct 2, 2021)

    I slightly adjusted the style of the theme to make them more pleasing to the eye.

App Description
Muse is a canvas for thinking that helps you get clarity on things that matter. Think in private or collaborate with others.

BEYOND WHITEBOARDS
with nested boards
Each Muse board is like a whiteboard that can hold even more whiteboards. Your boards grow organically over time as you develop an idea. Stay in the ideation flow, worry about organizing later.

REFERENCE & REMIX
with linked cards & Excerpts
Linked cards let you reference boards from multiple places. And excerpts let you remix parts of PDFs and images without losing the context of the source. Grow your Muse into a space of interconnected whiteboards.

ONE CANVAS FOR ANYTHING
with ink + text + cards
Developing an idea starts with collecting inspiration and stray thoughts. Muse lets you put everything on a single canvas: writing, scribbles, notes, images, videos, PDFs, web links, and any other files. Lay out all the raw materials, then connect the dots with ease.

COLLABORATION
with shared workspaces
Add collaborators to a Muse workspace to plan and strategize together. They'll feel right at home with live cursors, comments, following, and templates.

AND PLENTY MORE
→ Search and quick-jump to boards
→ Read and annotate PDFs
→ Create connections between cards
→ Export boards as PDFs or PNGs
→ Local-first data with instant sync

    - Workspaces: Create multiple Muse workspaces and switch between them with the workspace switcher in the new sidebar (upgrade to a paid membership for more workspaces)
    - Collaboration: Add collaborators to a Muse workspace to work together on Muse boards (upgrade to a paid membership for more collaborators per workspace)
    - Collaboration features: Muse 3 adds many collaboration-based features like online status, live cursors, following (click on the avatar of another user to follow them), board presence (user avatars show up on the board that they are in), and comments (add them through the new toolbar)

    UI features
    - Redesigned interface: Muse now has a persistent navigation bar at the top, a toolbar at the bottom, and an optional sidebar showing linked cards and other features.
    - Breadcrumb navigation: The new navigation bar shows you the full path of your current board and lets you navigate easily.
    - Back / forward navigation: The new navigation bar lets you navigate back and forward between boards as you would in a web browser.

    - UI customization: On iPad, you can now activate two gestures for advanced users in Settings: A 3-finger-swipe to close boards, and a tap on the canvas to hide the UI.

    New tools
    - Search: Find and open boards based on their title or any text within them. Search is accessible through the sidebar.
    - Card connections: A new tool in the toolbar lets you select two cards and connects them with a line that moves along with the cards.

    - Templates: We have added a first batch of pre-made templates to the toolbar, focused around team workflows.
    - Copy URL: The share menu in the navigation bar now has an option to copy the URL to the current board. Anyone with Muse installed who is a collaborator in the workspace will be able to open the board through the URL.

    - Onboarding: New users will see a short series of guided onboarding instructions to help them get started.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fix an issue where swiping while a PDF was scrolling would incorrectly slow the scroll.
    - Fix an issue where selections were being deselected when tilting the iPad

Version 1.1.1 (Jun 16, 2020)

    - Creating an excerpt from a lasso selection makes a non-rectangular excerpt.
    - The type of selection is determined by the grip of the Pencil and the resulting angle of the Pencil to the iPad. A low-angle grip makes a block selection, a regular grip a lasso selection.

Version 1.1 (Jun 5, 2020)
    - Selections can now also be moved with this Pencil. Whereas a finger in a selection moves ink & cards (on boards) or creates an excerpt (on images and PDFs), the Pencil always moves only ink.
    - Excerpt cards are now heuristically downsized when placed in the inbox, so that their size is better when placed on boards.

    Bugfixes:
    - Fix PDF view sometimes scrolling after dragging an excerpt.
    - Correct issue with excerpts sometimes containing the wrong content.
Version 1.0.9 (May 28, 2020)
    Bugfixes:

    - Address memory issues that caused crashes on certain complex boards.
Version 1.0.8 (May 27, 2020)

    - Avoid flashing recently erased ink if the Pencil is briefly lifted during an erase stroke.
    - When sharing an item to Muse that has multiple representations, only create a single card in Muse for the richest representation.
    - When indicating successful sharing of an item to Muse, only show the left-most part of the home board if that board has been expanded, to avoid distortion.
Version 1.0.7 (May 20, 2020)
    - New login flow uses automatically emailed login links instead of manually sent access codes

    Bugfixes:

    - Undoing the move of a selection containing both ink and cards now undoes all of those moves in one action, instead of requiring an undo for each individual move
    - Don't auto-complete selections to tiny areas
    - Only allow selections with two fingers down on boards
    - Include ink on PDF exports
    - Correctly update the iOS search index when a board's title is removed or changed
    - Fix crashes on imports of bundles with many URL cards

    - You can now select ink and cards on a board with the selection tool, available from the tool switcher
    - The selection tool can also be invoked by holding down two fingers while using the Pencil
    - Once selected, content can be moved within a board, or deleted by flicking it off the edge
    - The erase tool is now available in the tool switcher too, in addition to the existing method of holding down one finger while using the Pencil

    Bugfixes:

    - Undo / redo taps are better disambiguated from finger presses to temporarily switch between Pencil tools
    - Stopping a scrolling board with two fingers will no longer trigger an undo
    - Fixed issue with hiding and showing card titles when cards are overlapping
Version 1.0.5 (Apr 22, 2020)

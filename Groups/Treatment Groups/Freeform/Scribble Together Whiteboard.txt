App Description
Draw to­geth­er in real time, from any­where! In seconds, any­one can follow along with your drawing or draw with you from the app or on the web. Use Scrib­ble along­side a call; talk with Face­Time or any other app you like.

DRAW ON ANY­THING
Draw over pdfs and im­ages. Snap a pic­ture of home­work and draw on it, or re­view a pdf to­geth­er. Once you are fin­ished, you can save out a new pdf with your an­no­ta­tions.

WEB OR APP
Work with any­one, even your guests who don’t have an iPad or iPhone. The web app can be used to draw us­ing a tablet, touch screen com­put­er, or sty­lus. Display your live drawing on a big screen in a classroom or conference room using any browser and a convenient link.

SET UP IN A SNAP
Get­ on the same white­board to­geth­er in seconds. No reg­is­ter­ing for an ac­count or adding con­tacts in yet an­oth­er app. Once you’ve con­nect­ed in Face­Time or by phone you can tell your guests to join you using a link or a code, for free, with no messy sign ups.

IN­FI­NITE SPACE, UN­LIM­IT­ED BOARDS
Control scrolling of the infinite drawing space so that everyone sees the same area at the same time. Whiteboards are unlimited, so you can start fresh for each topic. Unlike a real whiteboard, many people can draw in the same space at the same time!

POINT AND GES­TURE
Point­ things out as you’re speaking with Scribble’s vir­tu­al laser point­er. No more clumsy describing of which part of a pic­ture you're re­fer­ring to – just use the mag­i­cal dis­ap­pear­ing laser ink. Designate different colors if you and your guests both need to point.

PEN­CIL SUP­PORT
If you’ve got an iPad Pro and Apple Pen­cil, drawing feels especially great in Scrib­ble. It’s like us­ing pa­per, but you can draw with any­one, any­where in the world. You can also use Settings to decide what you’d like your finger to do while you have the Pencil in hand.

NEAT SHAPES, STRAIGHT LINES
Can’t draw in a straight line? Neither can we! Scribble helps you draw perfect lines and shapes. Draw and pause without lifting your marker: you’ll see your shape pop magically into a rectangle, circle, ellipse, parallelogram, trapezoid, triangle or straight line.

FREE FOR GUESTS
Invit­ing peo­ple re­quires Scribble membership, but your guests join you for free. The membership subscription comes free for 2 weeks per monthly subscription, or 1 month per annual subscription. Drawing on your own is also free, and you can keep your whiteboards if you decide you don’t want to invite others anymore.

Pay­ment will be charged to your iTunes ac­count at con­fir­ma­tion of pur­chase. The sub­scrip­tion auto-re­news at the same price un­less dis­abled in iTunes Ac­count Set­tings 24 hours be­fore the end of the pe­ri­od each month. You can go to scribble.cool/cancel for instructions to cancel your subscription and turn auto-renew off.

    We've also updated the home screen layout, added a settings window, and fixed some bugs. We can all agree it is a great release.
Version 1.18 (Jun 6, 2018)
    Passing notes in Scribble? Good news! Now a blue dot will show when there are new changes in one of your whiteboards.
Version 1.17.1 (May 9, 2018)
    We have glitter!
    PDFs and images are easier to use. You’ll see them in the home screen thumbnail now. You can switch colors more quickly by dragging up and releasing on the color swatch. It’s the little things, you know?
    1.17 a few days ago had a bug - you could only see the first page of a pdf. Sorry! This hotfix resolves the bug.

The laser pointer also has different colors now. The web version is much faster - get a link to your boards on the web if you haven't tried it yet!

    The astute observer might be wondering what happened to v1.15. I wish I had a good explanation.
Version 1.14 (Feb 8, 2018)
    Fast for everyone! Now Scribble uses can use two graphics technologies - OpenGL or Metal. The last version made things fast for devices that supported Metal. This version uses OpenGL for similar speedups on all other devices, like the iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Mini or iPhone 5.
Version 1.13 (Feb 1, 2018)
    Faster. Way faster.

    Scribble now uses Metal, Apple's super-efficient graphics stuff. Writing, scrolling, and especially zooming should be much smoother. This applies to devices that support Metal, which is anything released after 2013. Even if you don't have Metal there are fixes that should make it a little faster for you too.

    Rock on with Metal
    \m/ ( `◉ _◉´) \m/

    - Fix a crash on iOS 9 and iOS 10 when sharing a link.
    - It is easier to accept a request when someone is joining your whiteboard.

    The ink has been improved to be smoother and faster. Our colors are better too!

    Working with PDFs and images is also easier.

    Of course, no release would be complete without various bug fixes. We've got 'em too.

    This version adds support for the iPhone X. Mine should be arriving in the mail any day now...
Version 1.6 (Oct 30, 2017)

Version 1.5 (Oct 23, 2017)
    Add recent contacts to a new whiteboard with one button press. It is an even faster way to start collaborating with someone you've worked with before.
Version 1.4 (Oct 8, 2017)

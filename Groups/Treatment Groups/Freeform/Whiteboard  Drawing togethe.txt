App Description
Love Whiteboard? So do we. Hence, we created this app for simple pleasures of enhancing and enjoying your art. How you may ask?

Well, we do not come with too many tools for distraction. It’s pure and simple like working with
pen & paper & colour. What more do we want?

The app comes with a pencil in different sizes. You can have the canvas as plain or have a grid or maybe lines. You can give realistic touch to your drawing with a range of colours on our colour palette.

What can you create using the app?

- Create a brief visual of a presentation
- Edit any existing image or click a picture and draw/write on it.
- Make use of our grid to generate a drawing of any kind of reports/charts


Keep it simple silly. Keep having fun. Keep drawing.

Keep coming to us ;)

And let us know how you like it !

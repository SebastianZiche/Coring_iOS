Now the canvas has not one but two layers! It s like having a secret superpower for your artwork. You can draw the outline on the top layer and color on the bottom layer and the colors will never cover the outline. There are other creative ways to use these two layers. Imagine drawing something sneaky on the bottom layer and then surprising everyone by covering it up with a fantastic creation on the top layer. And when you want to reveal the hidden masterpiece just erase the top layer and let the magic unfold. You can also make it a guessing game. Oh and speaking of erasers we ve made a small improvement. In the past it would just cover things up with white color but now it s a true eraser that actually removes the drawings. When you export your image with a transparent background the erased area becomes transparent too! No more dull white spots messing up your artwork.

And it supports Password Autofill so logging in has never been faster. Taking notes is only half the battle finding the note you need when you need it is the other half and a bunch of search improvements will help you do that: Search results now display matching tags search supports tag:keyword search parameters to help you find notes whose tags contain specific keywords and search is now diacritic insensitive so you can enter search terms with or without accents and still get matches. You can also alter the order of search results right from your Notes List. Fancy! Continued visual upgrades make usability better and better: the search bar no longer displays when the Trash Filter is active and previews have been upgraded to fit more content on the screen. And as always a few bug fixes: bugs stopping Search Mode from dismissing properly and another that caused the keyboard s appearance not to match the selected theme are no more.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The last time I was awake before you left I was worrying about my schoolwork. Don t worry Dad. With your support I really learned everything. Things I want to learn: development music theory Linguistics film history design psychology photography game design development translation writing economics leadership business etc. I m probably one of the few people who has watched classes from all departments at the university.

This app is probably the most talked about app in the last few months Dad. Even though I don t have the equipment to use myself they always give me suggestions and ideas to help me get the right product for the user and they always help me when I need it. Even if I tell you not to rush don t get discouraged along with me but be patient and take your time to encourage me. Your support and love I really feel I also pass on your expectations and your support to all users. We would like to receive Dad s support and trust as well as your heart into this app and all future products and share them with the world!

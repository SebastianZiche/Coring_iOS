If you re in a notebook or space and click into the search bar the app will start your search in that notebook or space by default. When you filter your tags you can now choose whether or not to include any child tags the ones nested under a main tag as well. Because even though we all love children sometimes they just get in the way. You can now reveal and edit an encrypted block of text without permanently decrypting it first. The text will be re encrypted as soon as you navigate to a different note so your sensitive data stays hidden. Fixed Sometimes if you closed a note and then reopened it the edit button would disappear. But things should be back to normal now. The Assigned tab in the Tasks view wasn t grouping your tasks by who they were assigned to. That was disappointing but on the bright side we fixed it. We spotted a rare bug that may have been preventing you from adding a due date to a task from within a note. It should be smooth sailing now though.

To help you find what you re looking for even quicker you ll now see a list of suggested filters at the top of the note list after you perform a search or add a filter. We ve improved how the app handles hyperlinks in tasks so you can tap on more links in more places and do more with them. For example: URLs in task titles and links in tasks within a note. There s a whole lot more but you get the idea. If you re in the By Due Date tab in the Tasks view tasks in each section are now sorted by due date so it s easier to see what you need to work on first. We made some changes to the way the app handles dragging and dropping and copying and pasting files between apps. Because it s important to play well with others. Fixed Occasionally not every image you scanned into Evernote would be saved. That was a big fail but thankfully it s now a thing of the past. We tinkered with the note editor to iron out a few annoying bugs that were buzzing around. Occasionally the app would crash when you tapped on a URL. That was kind of embarrassing but on the bright side we fixed it. We took careful aim and blasted a few Calendar bugs into the cosmic void.

We squashed a rare bug that was causing the app to crash when accessing Tasks. If you left a shared notebook containing tasks all your tasks would disappear not just those that had been shared with you. Admittedly this was a bit of an overreaction but on the bright side we fixed it.

Try Hey Siri remind me to leave work at 5PM in Evernote. Yep our integration just got even more awesome. We ve polished things up with a few design tweaks so it s easier to focus on your notes. Fixed: When you scrolled through your list of tags the keyboard would stop you from seeing all the way to the bottom. Bad keyboard! Very bad! If you had a lot of notes on your iPhone X and we mean A LOT! scrolling through the whole list would sometimes cause the app to crash. And that s no way to treat a power user is it When you opened a note from the suggested search results you could play an audio file but the controls were missing. Now you re back in the driver s seat. If you copied and pasted a table from Excel it would show up as an image that you couldn t edit. The only constant in life is change so we fixed that. Split View is great on the iPad but closing and reopening Evernote would sometimes cause a note to disappear. Since disappearing is only good if you re a magician we squashed that bug. Sometimes the keyboard wouldn t pop up if you were trying to share and edit a note. Things should be back to normal now though. Your photos would stop uploading to a note as soon as you clicked Done. That s probably not what you wanted so now they ll quietly upload in the background. When you locked your iPad in landscape mode the Evernote camera wouldn t stay with you. That made your pictures look weird so we fixed the glitch.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We re shaking things up by placing the icons for tags and reminders on top of the note editing toolbar so organizing your notes and setting reminders is always top of mind. New: We ve made some improvements to search and you can now sort by relevance so you can see the things that are well more relevant to what you re looking for. You now have the power to annotate HEIC files. In case you re not up on the lingo it s the format sorcery Apple uses to make their images higher quality yet smaller in size. In your settings you now have the option to turn auto add location on or off as you please. Fixes: If you had a lot of offline notebooks sometimes that slowed you down when you were creating or loading notes. But we fixed that so you should be off to the races now. When you tried to drag and drop from other apps your note would suddenly and annoyingly scroll the top. Now things will stay put. You connected Evernote and LinkedIn and were happily scanning business cards but the profile photos of your contacts weren t appearing. Which really got in the way of the whole putting a face to the name thing. We ve made changes so that notes will not be shown in iMessage or the iOS widget when pin lock is enabled.

Good news for Premium and Business customers: You love the Context feature so we ve brought it back. Reunion tour! We ve tweaked the note list view so you always know where you are and when . Now the month and year stays pinned helpfully at the top as you browse your notes. Or if you use the scrollbar a box automagically appears so you can leap from month to month like a gazelle. We ve cleaned up the sharing menu to make it easier for you to share your notes and generate links so other people can view them. The previous options are still there too we just brought the good stuff to the front. Let us know what you think! Fixed: You may have been getting an error message when you tried to view your recent notes in the widget. That s probably not what you were hoping for but we ve fixed it now. When you looked at a note s preview in the note list any bullets you had would appear above the text not next to it where you d expect. Weird right It all looks good now though.

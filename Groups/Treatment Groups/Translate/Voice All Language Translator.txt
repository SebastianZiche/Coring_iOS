App Description
If you travel a lot or frequently talk to foreigners for business, try installing the mobile app “Speak and Translate” for automatic translations. It has an integrated AI based on the "Translation of all language" function. This intelligent digital application fully replaces or even outperforms a live translator: it understands human speech just as well and translates it to a nearly unlimited number of languages.

Conversation Translator

The app is lightweight and has minimum technical requirements. The app is activated as soon as it's downloaded. It features a sleek layout and a user-friendly interface. It takes users just a few seconds to figure out how this universal interpreter translator works.

Features of Speak to Translate

The app is speedy, so please feel free to launch it right in the street or another public place for a quick casual dialogue. You'll perfectly understand what your interlocutor talks about and will be able to freely express yourself.

The app will help you get rid of the psychological barrier. Many people suffer from an irrational fear: "How can I come up to a stranger if my vocabulary is limited and I make grammar mistakes?". As soon as you establish direct contact with a foreigner through this app, you'll feel confident and more eager to initiate a dialog next time.

Text & Voice Translator with Dictionary

You may use this app as a dictionary as well. Just write or pronounce a word and you'll see a list of its possible meanings. The multi-language translation will be precise regardless of the topic of the conversation.

Text input translator

The app easily translates and recognizes voices in most languages of the world. It recognizes two forms of input:

- Spoken phrases
- Phrases that you type

Even if it's a rare African or Asian dialect, the service successfully handles the inquiry. The single requirement to a spoken conversation is: a phrase should be audible enough. If a live person manages to understand the sense of the speech, the automated service will do as well.

Camera Translator

Camera Translator feature let you translate text , text from image in allmost all available languages in one click.

The app has smart OCR feature which enable you to translate any text direct using camera without need of writing it.

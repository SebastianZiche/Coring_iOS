Education (Applications)

App Description
Learning a foreign language? We all know that practice makes perfect but... how do we find partners to practice with? What if nobody in your social network can practice with you?

Introducing Lext Talk: the first social networking and chat app designed for Language Exchange!

Search the map to find others who have similar language interests, near you or across the globe. Send them a message and start the conversation!

Are you a true beginner? No problem! let our translation service help you find the right words, store those difficult words in your own dictionary to keep them handy, practice at your own pace with as many exchange partners as you like, and see your conversation level improve.

Good for beginners, who are more comfortable texting only, but also an easy tool for advanced learners to find language exchange partners wherever they are.

Are you a language teacher? Use this app to find potential students!

If you are tired of looking up on wordreference how to translate some words or expressions, Lext Talk is the perfect solution for you.

Getting started is very easy: choose your languages, place yourself in the map and.... Lext Talk!

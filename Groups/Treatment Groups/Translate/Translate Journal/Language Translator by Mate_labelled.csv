You should ve already received an email from us which said that we re removing third party login methods Facebook and Google. Our decision is privacy and Mate s stability driven. Read more here: https: blog.gikken.co were removing third party login methods from mate Help Center. We ve created a help center where you can find answers to most questions tutorials etc. Check it out here: https: help.gikken.co hc Improved: Full page translation in Safari. We rewrote the website translation script. It should be faster friendlier and more stable now. Previously it failed to work on some sites e.g. Medium.com now it works perfectly on every site. Fixed: Hebrew full page translation works well again in Safari. Issue with AirPods and other earphones was solved. Mate was speaking out via iPhone s loudspeaker even though the earphones were connected. Now it goes via earphones as intended. iOS keyboard autocompletion is back in the main app. Correct transliteration for Traditional Chinese. A couple of light dark mode bugs were squashed. Copy button didn t work in the Safari extension now it does. Safari extension s bar could look ugly on some sites due to CSS confilcts now it s better. Speak out for the original language didn t work in the Safari extension. We fixed it. A nasty sync bug was fixed. Previously when you signed out then erased your History and or Phrasebook and then sign in again it would erase it on the server as well. Now it won t.

Without kidding it s even larger than the initial Mate release. It s packed with 5 totally new features and a few dozens of smaller improvements. Offline Mode Yes you re reading it correctly! From now on Mate can translate offline too. Just download offline packs for languages you need from the language picker and you re good to go. Packs are reasonably sized each of them is just around 50 MB. Please note offline translation come without synonyms and phonetic transcription though. Safari Extension We added yet another way to translate seamlessly within iOS now in Safari. With our brand new action extension you can translate words sentences and even full pages without leaving Safari. Turn on Mate Extension from the share menu in Safari s toolbar. Dark Mode It s better late than never right Mate offers both light and dark modes now. Smart Swap Mate will always try to understand the input language itself even if you forget to set it correctly. More Data About Words Now Mate shows phonetic transcription for the original too. We also added support for genders for languages like French German Spanish Italian etc. All New Speech Translator Mate s Speak Translate feature was redesigned from the ground up. It s not a separate screen anymore. You can start talking to Mate by simply tapping on the microphone icon in the input field. Pretty much the same way as audio message in WhatsApp or Telegram work. The words will appear in the field on the fly. Updated Home Screen Quick Actions Long tap on Mate s icon on home screen to access our revamped quick actions. You can start speech or clipboard translation from there. Better Look on iPad We owe an apology to iPad users that Mate was a downright iPad hostile app up until this moment. We optimized every screen and extension to look and feel natively on iPad. Speed and Stability Improvements Phonetic transcription should never fail to load translation speed became considerably faster. Enhanced Copy Options You can copy phonetic transcription or transliteration too now. Just long tap on it. Bugs Fixed and Smaller Improvements Mate won t interrupt your music playback when using the speak out feature anymore. We polished Mate s look on iPhone X XR Xs Max and 11. We made the main screen cleaner and more solid. We localized Mate into a bunch of new languages. We also polished old localizations. All in app copy should ve become more clear and concise. Mate is also available for Mac and as a browser extension for all major browsers: Follow us on Twitter for updates: twitter.com MateTranslate Send feedback at support matetranslate.com.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Karate was used. Boxes are back in their place. Your hard earned progress and points weren t saving properly. Lame. But fixed. There was a glutton bug eating up courses when you tried to download them and that made the app crash. Squashed that one. If you deleted all your courses the app would get sad and confused and crash repeatedly. After some therapy it has come to grips with the reality of empty dashboards. No more crashes there. Something happened in Missions that messed with Mission Control s messages and replaced them with your answers. It was either evil spy agents or our AI is becoming self aware. In either case we ve put a stop to that nonsense. If you ve read this far the supermolecules of learning super powers will be with you all year long.

There s classified memos going around designers working behind closed doors and the engineers all turn their screens away when someone walks by. The only info they ve made available is this: The font in the Mode Selector bar now adapts to screen size so text is no longer truncated. Speed Review needed 20 items to successfully populate a session now only 3 items are needed. This is just so weird. Something something is going on guuuuuys!

Presentation cards are important man. Because like when you see a new word and its meaning for the first time it should glide into your mind like Michael Jackson s shoes doing the Moonwalk. And the old cards were a bit more Austin Powers than King of Pop. But now that they ve undergone a scientifically engineered makeover their brain appeal has been ramped up for maximum mind glide.

We have traced a clearer navigation path between the interconnected Galaxies of Language that populate the Memriseverse. This should make it easier for humans to pinpoint their location in their target Galaxy as well as moving to the next or previous Galaxy should they wish to alter the course of their mission at will. Engineering Officers from the Coding division have also expanded visual communications capabilities granting humans with Pro status a FULL learning video experience whereas before they were limited to reviewing. We expect to see an increase in their language superpowers as a result of finding themselves surrounded by videos of native creatures scattered all through their target Galaxy. Captain s log supplemental. We have beamed down extra satellites to orbit all level planets in each Galaxy. Their purpose is to keep count of the Difficult items humans develop during their mission. Further improvements to navigation include hiding mnemonic devices behind a reveal button and locking access to higher level planets until current level planets have been conquered.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We ve also thrown in a number of micro improvements including: A percentage complete count for course download so you can see how the offline download is progressing.

Many thanks! They add up we hope to a new layer of lustre to the already lustrous learning experience we re proud to purvey. Here are a few of them: Levels and courses that have been completed now exhibit the achievement with a celebratory icon. Mems containing lettering from non Roman alphabets no longer show up as gibberish but instead as intended. Yay for learners of Russian Korean Arabic etc! We ve added in the daily goal view even after course completion: for those learners who like to keep motivated as they consolidate and deepen their knowledge. The transitions at the end session screen now glide with elegance where before they stuttered. We ve tweaked a number of views on the iPad version to best embrace the dimensions of that platform. A subtle bug on our custom keyboard fluttered out of the app. The attentive memriser will also be able to identify some dozen other micro tweaks that smooth this or that area of the experience. Many thanks for the suggestions keep em coming!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

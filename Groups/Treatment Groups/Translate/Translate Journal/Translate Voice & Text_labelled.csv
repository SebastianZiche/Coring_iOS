Our team has been working hard to provide you with new features and improvements to enhance your translation experience. Conversation mode: Our conversation mode now supports even more languages and we have improved its accuracy. In addition we have made it even more user friendly by introducing a new split screen feature. The lower half of the screen displays the translation for one speaker while the upper half is flipped to show the translation for the other speaker. This makes it easier than ever to have natural conversations with people who speak different languages. Phrasebook: Our new phrasebook feature allows you to save frequently used phrases for quick access even when you re offline. You can create your own personalized phrasebook and easily access it anytime anywhere. Bug fixes: We have fixed some minor bugs and improved the overall performance of the app ensuring that you have a smooth and seamless translation experience. Thank you for using Translate: voice text! We hope these new features and improvements will make your language learning journey even more enjoyable.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

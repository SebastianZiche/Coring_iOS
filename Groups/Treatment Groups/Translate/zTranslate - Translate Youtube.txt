App Description
If you want to watch a movie but it doesn't have subtitles available for your language? Don't worry, because this app will be the best solution for you.


This app will use the video's original subtitles, then translate it into various languages, support over 110 languages.

Feature:
Watch Youtube videos with subtitles in your language
Choose a video with subtitles, and translate it into any language you want.

Compare subtitle for foreign language learning
Simultaneous display of the original subtitle and the translated subtitle, so that learners can compare 2 sentences.

Lookup dictionary
You can immediately look up the dictionary by tap the word.

The shadowing technique
Shadowing is a language learning technique where you repeat an audio just after you hear it. You’re acting like an “echo” or a “shadow” (hence the name “shadowing"). You listen to the words and then say them back out loud. Shadowing helps you develop all the physical aspects of fluency. These include things like pronunciation, prosody, and rhythm of English. It looks like this:
1. Find a video of your interest
2. Listen to the audio from video first
3. Shadow the audio with a transcript
4. Shadow without a transcript

Other
Support full screen mode
Favorite video
Add videos to favorites and watch them later

How do I use:
Open the app and select the video you want to watch.
You can enter keywords to search for videos, note that only videos with closed captions will be displayed.


Note:
This app only translates from existing subtitles of the video, because not all Youtube videos have subtitles, so some videos cannot be translated.

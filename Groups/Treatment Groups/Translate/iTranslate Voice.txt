    If you like iTranslate Voice then please rate it on the App Store after every update!
Version 2.2 (Apr 7, 2014)
    The magical voice-to-voice translator, has been redesigned and reimagined for iOS 7, including new features such as support for iOS7 offline voices, universal binary for iPhone and iPad, and much more!

    New features and improvements:

    • Redesigned and reimagined for iOS 7
    • Universal binary for iPhone and iPad
    • Support for iOS 7 offline voices (= faster translations)
    • AirTranslate now works even better with new iOS 7 peer to peer technology
    • Get suggestions while editing
    • Improved voice recognition with greater accuracy
    • Much faster translation results, especially in combination with the new iOS 7 offline voices
    • Brand-new App Icon


    A note to all our users:

    Initially we decided to release this version of iTranslate Voice as a new app and charge an upgrade price, since we spent a lot of time on the iOS7update. Additionally iTranslate Voice is generating us ongoing costs for every translation request. We hoped that by releasing a new App and charging another dollar it would have been an easy way for us and our users to do upgrade pricing, which is a long proven business model in the software world.
    Unfortunately we learned that in order to get discovered on the App Store (e.g. via Search) it is very important to keep historical sales and downloads, which are of course wiped out by releasing a new App instead of updating an existing App. We ended up with a lot less users discovering iTranslate Voice 2 than we hoped.
    Our goal is to create the best translator Apps in the world and to keep doing that we need our Apps to be discovered. Therefore we decided to revert that decision, update the first version of iTranslate Voice as well as removing the new version of iTranslate Voice 2 from the App Store. Both Apps are still completely restore-able and will also receive updates, but only the original iTranslate Voice will from now on be on sale on the App Store.
    We apologize to all our users who have helped us by upgrading to the new version. If you want you can request a refund through iTunes (if you don't know how please contact us at feedback@sonicomobile.com). However, we still believe that 1 dollar for this update is a bargain and helps us to even more improve our translations Apps. We hope that in future the App Store will provide a better upgrade mechanism, which would save users as well as developers a lot of troubles.

    Sincerely,
    Alexander Marktl, CEO Sonico Mobile

App Description
Auto Translate for Safari is a wonderful extension, just a press away, ready to use every time you need to translate entire webpages or just paragraphs. It can also translate text from other iOS applications using the share option (emails, documents or messages).

Navigate the web and translate the entire page in your preferred language (automatically after page load or manually only when you want to) - that's it.
You can also select only paragraphs to translate. You will not loose the visual layout (the page will look the same) or functionality (the page will work the same).

So every time you need to read a website, buy online, research a report or some instructions in a language you do not understand, just use this extension and everything will be easier.

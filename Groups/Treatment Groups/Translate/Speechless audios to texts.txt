- Long press on the voice message.
- Click 'Forward,' then tap the share icon in the bottom right.
- Finally, select 'Transcribe the audio' or 'Translate the audio' from the share sheet. (If they don't appear, please check the 'More' screen for the 'Transcribe the audio' option.)

2- For Messages:

- Click on the wave icon.
- Tap the share icon in the bottom left.
- Select 'Transcribe the audio' or 'Translate the audio'from the share sheet.

3- For Voice Memos:
- Click on the more icon on the voice memo.
- Choose 'Share' from the menu.
- Finally, select 'Transcribe the audio' or 'Translate the audio' from the share sheet.

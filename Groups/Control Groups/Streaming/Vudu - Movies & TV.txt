    NEW BUGS

Version 4.8 (Dec 21, 2015)
    MAIN COURSE
    • Introducing Spotlight: a purty new place to quickly find the best deals, collections, trailers, free TV and more. We add new titles and deals just about every day, so hooray for more reasons to look at your phone!

    SIDES
    • The return (and not a reboot) of Search for My Movies & My TV
    • You can now watch trailers without signing in. Are you not entertained?!

    EXTRA GRAVY
    • On the TV season episode grid, we moved up the episode play button to align with the episode name. OCD much?
    • Some movies and TV shows dated, got a little biz-zay and suddenly we had bundles with both movies and TV shows together running around. Dealing with these multi-format young’uns wasn’t easy. Do we put them in My Movies? Or My TV? A special section of their own? The politically correct answer is now both.
    • The playback bar now shows when casting with the iPad Mini. It previously only did on larger iPads, but HR told us we couldn’t discriminate against small devices.
    • Sometimes play buttons would show up on TV series you didn’t own. Gotcha! LOL. JK. Don’t be silly. It was just a bug. If it really played you would have heard about it on Slickdeals.
    • In some cases, if you pressed play then quickly closed the player, then repeatedly did that, the audio would continue playing. You would not unlock a secret VUDU level or offer. This is not a Contra.
    • Other improvements and fixes to download and playback.
Version 4.7 (Oct 12, 2015)
    FEATURES ADDED
    • Now you can browse the entire VUDU library and watch thousands of free trailers and bonus features. It sure beats catching up on wedding and baby news on Facebook.
    • Auto-magic search suggestions on over 100K+ movies and TV shows, plus sort and filter by genre, date, reviews and more. For example, 1980’s Horror. Or 1980’s movies with 
Version 4.2 (Jun 1, 2015)
    Tweaks & Fixin's

    • Permanently reprimanded the bug that prevents you from watching downloaded movies when you don't have WiFi, cellular data, or you know, happen to be in a Faraday cage.

NOTE: This update requires Plex Media Server 0.9.12.5 or newer. We ve completely redesigned the app both visually and structurally. It s easier than ever to navigate your libraries find something to play and the new discovery features help you get to the content you re most likely to want. You can continue browsing during playback and use the new mini player to see and control what s currently playing. We ve also added support for more recent media server improvements like extras related content and our awesome new music features. All of this great functionality is presented with our beautiful new visual style it s fast fluid and fun. The new single server UI matches other modern Plex apps. All servers are treated equally whether they belong to you or have been shared with you by someone else. Our brand new audio player is much faster when loading or seeking and switches seamlessly between cellular wifi networks without interrupting playback. We re also well on our way to gapless playback support it s close but not quite perfect yet . The video player has been enhanced with the addition of chapter selection and the ability to choose audio streams subtitles and video quality during playback. There are many many improvements to Mobile Sync. Playlists can now be synced incremental syncs are super fast and background downloads mean you no longer need to leave the app open for a sync to complete. We took the core of the Plex Media Server shrank it down and embedded it within the iOS app so your synced content will now benefit from all the rich browsing discovery and playback features it provides. You can browse your camera roll and fling your photos and videos to other Plex players. Multi user households rejoice! The app now supports Plex Home including managed users. There s also support for secure connections to Plex Media Server. When you see the green padlock badge next to your server your connection is fully encrypted. We d like to thank you all for being so patient with the lack of updates in recent months we hope you think it was worth the wait! We re extremely proud of the work we ve done here and are thrilled to be able to share it with you at last.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PlexSync Premium feature The main feature that s new to Plex iOS is PlexSync. Using PlexSync you can download content to your device so you can view it when you re offline. PlexSync will eventually be a premium feature available for a small subscription fee but we re making it available free of charge to our PlexPass members until it graduates from its Technology Preview period. PlexSync is universal Whether you want to sync content from your library or from a channel PlexSync can handle it all. PlexSync is rich When you re offline you get almost exactly the same experience as if you were online. All your metadata is visible including posters background art and theme music and you can filter your content just as if you were browsing live content. PlexSync is flexible You decide what you want to sync. PlexSync can sync everything or limit based on duration or number of items or include only unwatched episodes you name it! PlexSync is smart Your server will automatically convert more content for your device as you watch. Your watched state view offsets are synced back to your server next time you connect. PlexSync is considerate Your server won t use precious CPU cycles converting content if you re already watching something live. You can also choose to only display synced content when you re not on a Wi Fi network ensuring Plex doesn t use up your mobile data allowance. Audio transcoding PlexPass feature preview We love our PlexPass members and wanted to give you a bit more to play with so we ve enabled the transcoder for audio content as well as video letting you enjoy content in formats like FLAC or WMA on your iOS device. This feature is experimental but we ll fix any problems as soon as possible. UI Enhancements We spent a long time looking at the user interface considering how users interact with it and how we could make it better. We have many plans for improvements but decided to focus on a few major issues for the first release. Look Feel: There are no longer separate tabs for different modes the updated interface is focused mostly on displaying your content. We have lots of improvements planned but the new UI in the latest Plex provides an excellent foundation for us to build on in future versions. You may also notice the great new theme for the app integrating seamlessly with iOS while providing a look that is unmistakably Plex. Settings: We ve revamped the Settings view moving the things you d want to access more frequently to the main toolbar so they re just a single tap away and simplifying and reorganizing the rest so they re easier to access and understand. Speed: The app now launches faster and stores information from your servers on your iOS device reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred over your network while you browse. These changes make the app extremely responsive so much so that you may not even notice it s accessing your network at all! Friends: We ve integrated friend requests with your friends list and made the friends list easily available from the toolbar so you can access it any time you like. Home Screen Improvements Universal Channels Recently Added: All of your channels and all your recently added content is now visible on your home screen no matter how many servers you have. Universal On Deck: We ve had this request so many times that we ve lost count but it s finally here. We ve made On Deck available from your home screen showing content from all your library sections on all your servers. Please check the Plex blog for more information.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The best part? It’s only $4.99 per month or $49.99 a year after your FREE 7-day trial for all of these great features:

* Stream on your favorite devices
* Download to watch offline anytime, anywhere
* No TV provider needed
* 100% commercial free
* New movies added every week
* Themed playlists
* No commitments, cancel anytime

Use AirPlay to watch on your Apple TV (also available for download on the new Apple TVs!) and use “picture in picture” to multitask on your iPad Air.

Note: Movies can only be streamed in the U.S. and U.S. Territories.

Subscription automatically renews at the end of the current billing period. If you do not wish to have the account automatically renewed, you must turn off the auto-renew setting at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period; if you do not, your account will be charged.

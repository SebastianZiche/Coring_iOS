    Say hello to the latest version of XUMO! Updates include:

    -A view of the channel guide by genre. So you can find that gotta-have-it-now channel much, much faster. But hey, if you prefer exploring channel by channel instead, we still got you covered. Just toggle your way on back to the old view.

    -A new home for the Chromecast button. Tap the video you wish to cast, and the Chromecast button you know and love will be in the top right corner. Holler!

    And as always...
    -Caught some bugs and released them outside (the app), because sometimes squashing is too violent.
Version 2.2.1 (Jan 11, 2019)
    - Fix for missing ChromeCast button!
Version 2.2.0 (Dec 17, 2018)
    -Big news over here: we added AirPlay support! Now you can effortlessly stream XUMO from any Apple device to the big screen.

    -Have a ridiculously cool iPhone X, Xs or Xr? Well, we think you’re ridiculously cool too, so we optimized XUMO to fit your screen size.

    -Also: let’s be real...nobody likes bugs. Don’t worry, we fixed them plus other feature improvements.
Version 2.1.0 (Sep 19, 2017)
    Added the CBSN channel. It’s LIVE news, so you’ll be in the know as soon as everyone else is in the know. And, what’s better than being in the know? Maybe pizza…

    Improved UI/UX. Basically our vague way of saying we want to look our best for you and make sure you have a great experience. Because let’s be honest; we want another date.

    Oh and the standard "bug fixes and optimizations" you would expect from us (gotta keep the lights on, ya know?).
Version 2.0.0 (Aug 29, 2017)
    We’re coming back at ya' cleaner, faster and stronger than ever! Really, our new app is brand spankin’ new. It’s super cool—and so are you.

    So, what’s new?
    -We’ve added 100+ channels. The channel guide is huge. Seriously, you can’t miss that thing. Surf, scan at will.

    -We made live entertainment easier to discover and watch. Because, treat yo’ self.

    -We enabled push notifications. Not trying to be pushy, but we know you love your viral hits, breaking stories & trending videos. Now you won’t miss anybody rollerblading off a cliff with a parachute and a lion strapped to their back or the next political event (we promise not to inundate you).

    -Brand pages. Found a channel you love? Now you can visit their dedicated page and watch everything they’ve got. Because you know you love your game highlights and analysis, you sports fool, you.

    Fixed: loading time. Discover new entertainment faster than Michael Phelps can race a great white shark.

    ALSO…
    Behind-the-scenes enhancements and general tweaks to make sure you stay entertained. After all, that’s what we’re here for.

    Love the app? Rate us! Your feedback keeps us young.

App Description
Farsight is all about freedom, and remote viewing is our path to freedom. Here are Farsight's Mysteries projects, as well as new daring and cutting edge videos that are as revealing as they are entertaining, wise, and thought provoking. We don't just tell you that reality is not what it seems. We show you what reality actually is, and how each of us can change it. Farsight is the leading venue for full public projects involving the science and the application of remote viewing. Stranger than science fiction. This is real.

To access all features and content you can subscribe to FARSIGHT TV on a monthly or yearly basis with an auto-renewing subscription right inside the app.* Pricing can vary by region and will be confirmed before purchase in the app. In app subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of their cycle.

* All payments will be paid through your iTunes Account and may be managed under Account Settings after the initial payment. Subscription payments will automatically renew unless deactivated at least 24-hours before the end of the current cycle. Your account will be charged for renewal at least 24-hours prior to the end of the current cycle. Any unused portion of your free trial will be forfeited upon payment. Cancellations are incurred by disabling auto-renewal.

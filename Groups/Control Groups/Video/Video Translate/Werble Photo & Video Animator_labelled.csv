Within the Matte Tool create a matte with the button select source layers to define the matte and then select target layers to apply it. Matte source layers are automatically hidden but you can unhide them if desired using shortcuts on the left side of the source layer selector. Similar to the Mask Tool the Matte Tool has controls to adjust the blur opacity or preview appearance of each matte. Toggle between using source layer alpha and source layer luma with the toggle button on the right side of the source layer selector. Mattes incorporate animation masks and other effects applied to their underlying source layers allowing for complex animated mattes. Mattes provide new creative options not possible in previous versions of Werble! Stay tuned for forthcoming in depth tutorial videos. Improvements Starting from iOS 16 you can now copy image content from Photos including automatically extracted content and paste it into an existing edit by drag and drop or using the pop up menu on the left side of the layer editor. All collection editors layer selectors have been reworked. Collection editors now permanently expose the button on the right side and the left side features a pop up menu button with shortcuts for operations such as deleting modifying selection state hiding unhiding duplicating and more as appropriate. These buttons implement a long press menu with extra functionality where applicable. The composition background is now transparent instead of black appearing grey in the editor . Exported GIFs will maintain this transparency allowing you to create and export stickers. Exported H264 videos will still use a black background H264 does not support transparency . Other export formats that support transparency are planned for a future update.

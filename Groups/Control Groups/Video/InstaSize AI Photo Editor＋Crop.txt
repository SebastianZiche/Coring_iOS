Version 2.3 (Sep 9, 2013)
    ** WHAT'S NEW? **

    • LAYERS
    We are very excited to Introduce Layers. By using the layers option, you will be able to put text, overlays and filters in your pictures! 
    The new text option comes with over 30 fonts and unlimited colors so that you can easily customize your text however which way you want!
     We've gotten many emails from you guys saying that when applying a filter to an Instasized picture, the filter goes over the whole screen instead of just the photo. Well, we listened and have the solution. By using our filters and overlays, only the picture will be affected and not the entire screen. No more having color on the sides of your pictures. Unless, of course, you want to use one of our borders :). 

    • DESIGN
    InstaSize has a new look.

    • NO RESTART
    No longer will InstaSize restart when you exit out. If you have to leave the app and come back later, you will be right where you left off. 

    • NEW SHARING OPTION
    We've improved sharing to make things easier for you guys. Once you hit share, you will get a popup asking if you would like to share to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Save to camera roll and much more. 

    • STITCH
    10,  brand new collages to stitch!

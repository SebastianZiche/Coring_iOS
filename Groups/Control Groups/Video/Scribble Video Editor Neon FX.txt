App Description
> Unleash your Creativity and Liven up your Videos with Glowing Effects and advanced Hand Drawn Animations
> Professional Video Editor to create Animated Effects on Video

FEATURES:
- Import, Trim & Crop your video
- Access professional After Effects like level of editing: Doodle & Draw on your videos to create awesome animation effects.
- Unlimited potential: draw what you want and create unique and hand-crafted effects.
- Razor sharp precision: draw frame by frame in Full Mode in order to obtain professional editing results.
- Designer tools: customize your art brush to your wishes: Solid, Chalk or Glow. Select the brush size or color to create your own style.
- Quick mode: to maximize speed of editing, we have created a 'Quick mode' so you can edit the same video in half the time. You will draw on half of the frames of your video and the app will copy the drawing on the next frame. Less precise but way quicker.
- Full Mode: for precision and professional effects, choose Full Mode to draw on each frame of your video. The process is longer but just be patient, put in the time and as often in life, the result will be phenomenal.

Download now, be creative and impress your network on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat with unique hand crafted animation effects on your videos!

HOW DOES IT WORK:
- Import your video from the Gallery. You can trim and crop edit.
- The app will create a project and split the video in segments of 3 seconds to ensure stability (video editing is a heavy process for your device capabilities).
- Enter each segment and edit your frames one by one: draw on each frame of the video to create unique animation effects. You can choose brush style, color and size. Be creative, this is how the magic happens.
- After editing each segment, you can compile the full video and view the amazing result.
- You can then save or share to the world on your favorite networks.

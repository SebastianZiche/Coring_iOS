What's New

Version 8.3.2 (Feb 14, 2024)
    Introducing: LUMINA, a beautiful new film effect.

    Add a dreamy, glowy halo around all the pockets of light in your videos and photos. LUMINA was built with halation, a magical phenomenon that is typically only found in film but can now be experienced in this magical little app.

    LUMINA looks great on all types of content, but we think you'll especially love it on videos. We can't wait to see the art that you create.

    Introducing: Cocoa & Rose

    Two new presets and limited loungewear sets available on shoptezza.com

    A little note about the presets:

    Cocoa - Like milk poured into your morning coffee, Cocoa brings a luscious chocolate touch to your work. A bit moody and understated, we love nestling into Cocoa on our cozier photo and video shoots.

    Rose - Rose brings a perfect powdered sugar dusting of pink to your photography. Ideal for making your work just a bit softer while maintaining an editorial feel.

    We also fixed some issues with stop motion! Thank you for your feedback there.

    We can't wait to see the art that you create.

Let Filmatico bring film aesthetic to your digital photos with a single click. Feel the same excitement as if you are taking pictures with an actual film camera.
App Description
As shooting film is truly a magical way to capture moments, we recreated this experience with the most realistic approach. The design of a classic film camera, along with a traditional shutter sound, helps users immerse themselves in the world of analog photography and makes the process of taking photos more captivating and fun.

As for our filter, among its features are unique film texture and warm, vivid colors — the famous details that we love about analog photography. You can also add special effects such as random burns, light leaks, and scratches, making your photos look even more vintage.

Nothing will ever replace film, but here we try...

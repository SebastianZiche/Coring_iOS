App Description
Featured as “App of the Day” on the App Store – 1967: Retro Filters & Effects brings back all the tones, grain, and light leaks you would get from old-school analog cameras, minus the bulky housing and smelly darkroom chemicals. With the app’s minimalist interface and more than 200 filters, editing your photos to evoke the swinging ‘60s only takes a few taps.

We developed 1967: Retro Filters & Effects by studying 64 types of real film to create beautiful and accurate vintage effects. All the filters are divided into collections, where you can find different color emulations and effects such as bokeh and scratches.

Once you select a filter, tap it again to see the effect subtly change right before your eyes. Each variation will alter the light leak, scratches and textures. Each filter has more than 30 variations to cycle through by tapping. Adjust the opacity and dust sliders until the image is just right.

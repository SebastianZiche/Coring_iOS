    Happy Halloween! We have some new templates waiting for you. Check them out!

    In addition to our spooky new content update, we also have some great new improvements to the app's functionality.

    - We have greatly enhanced the 'timeline' feature and improved the overall experience around it. The whole app behaves much more like a professional video editor now. You can much more easily adjust the timing and durations of items in your designs. In addition, you're not limited to making only 60 second long videos anymore. You can now make videos for up to 60 minutes long.

    - We also removed the functionality that would automatically loop videos to fit them inside media item durations. Now, if you add videos under a media item, the app respects the original video durations. If there are multiple videos, they will simply be combined one after the other.

    - Lastly, we improved our image export feature. Now, when you choose to get a JPG or PNG export, you only get the snapshot of what there's on screen at the exact current time you're at.

    - This update also contains various other performance and stability improvements. Make sure you grab it for the ultimate experience.

App Description
I Love Film has been Today's App in 150 countries.

I love film will make your images look as if they were taken in the old days - with film.

Lots of care has been used when analyzing each film to match their original looks. The grain that comes with the films are real grains, scanned too perfection.

And who doesn't love the look of old film, hence the name 'I love film'.

To make you an even better photographer I have written 17 tutorials on how to improve and understand composition.
If you read through all of them, I can almost guarantee that your images will be so much better and you'll start to understand why some images that you see look beautiful.


KEY FEATURES:

130+ FILMS
Over 130 films are included in total and they simulated slides, color, black and white, instant and infrared films.

LIGHT LEAKS

GRAIN
Each film will has it grain just as their original has.

VIGNETTE

BOKEH

The camera will show the image using the film with grain in real time

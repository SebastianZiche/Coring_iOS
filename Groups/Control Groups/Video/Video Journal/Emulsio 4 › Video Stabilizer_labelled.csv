Improved video source handling. Emulsio now allows importing videos that have been copied through the Camera Connection Kit or some other means it is not restricted to camera roll anymore. Improved processing of video captured with other devices Android phones GoPro . In some situations videos could be lacking metadata that would lead to black image or translated image in preview and export. Emulsio now reconstructs erroneous or missing metadata and correctly processes those videos. Export failure correction. Emulsio will no longer fail when exporting a movie that has different duration for audio video tracks. This was typically happening when processing a movie captured by another app or imported from some other source. Output video duration fix. Exporting a video over 30sec no Pro Pack would trim it to 2 seconds. This no longer happens the exported video will be trimmed to 30 seconds instead when Pro Pack is not active.

Completely new version 2.0 with a new application icon. New user interface. Emulsio provides a more direct and interactive access to stabilization tools and previewing within the app. Emulsio is now free with In App purchase to remove 30 second limitation and watermark. Customers of version 1.x get these features for free. iOS 7 Optimized. Emulsio is making use of new video capabilities compositor only available on iOS 7 to enable realtime previewing and fast video rendering. Live Comparison. You can now play both the original and stabilized videos simultaneously to assess stabilizer effect and settings. Every change is immediately taken into account and reflected in the live comparison. Stabilization Improvements Improved Stabilization for Videos: Emulsio now tackles wobble distortion and motion discontinuity. We ve worked hard to make a smart stabilization method that is also fast. Wobble Distortion: New stabilizer adds handling of rolling shutter distortion that occurs when recording movies with rapid motion of the camera. Such video typically get wobble artifacts oblique distortion that Emulsio can remove. Discontinuity Handling: Rapidly changing scenes and camera flashes typically create motion discontinuity but these no longer affect the resulting stabilization. Black Border Handling. Previous versions of Emulsio known as Movie Stiller would generate black borders when motion compensation was too high. Emulsio can now handle this situation by momentarily decreasing stabilization strength to prevent black borders from happening. Optimized for iPhone 5s iPad Air Optimized for 64 bit. We ve done the maths for you: Emulsio on iPhone 5s is twice as fast as iPhone 5. We ve also tested 32 bit vs. 64 bit on the same iPhone 5s: 64 bit brings you an additional 35 processing speed and matches desktop class performances for video editing for the first time on a mobile phone. Handling of high speed 120 FPS frame per second videos. Stabilization is performed at original video speed and exported videos still are 120 FPS allowing slow motion editing specifically for iPhone 5s . Stabilizer Control Stabilizer Data Reporting. As a more advanced tool this allows to review internal stabilization data such as the instantaneous displacement of video frame along X Y axes rotational compensation wobble correction etc. These are reported both as live figures and graphically in video overlay. Adjustable Stabilization Strength Profile. Stabilizer strength can be adjusted depending on quality of original movie. You can further change internal stabilizer behavior by choosing stabilizer profile. Cinametic profile allows smoother motion picture like camera motion while Vibrations focuses more on removing smaller camera shakes while preserving original camera motion. Frame by frame image inspection. Video Editing Export Non destructive Time Editing. Removing some part of the video is very easy with Emulsio and you can always change your mind until final video export. Export Options. Once editing is finished you can export back to your album social networks like Facebook or any other app capable of handling videos.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

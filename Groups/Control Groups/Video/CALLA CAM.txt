App Description
Hi NOTEGG.

We have launched [CALLA].
[CALLA] is a random filter camera of film replacement type.

Starting with the idea of ​​keeping a warm eye on pretty things
I have been planning from a long time ago and made it by studying hard.

With so many filters that you do not have,
I prepared for you who are tired of using difficult editors.

Random photos
It's a bit stiff, a bit old,
I tried a lot to get a warm feeling.

It comes out randomly when you snap
Expect emotional photos.

In the future, we will add more films that contain
our NOTEGG emotion.
Thank you for your interest.



[How to use]
[+] Call up a picture or shoot with a camera
[=] It's easy to experience various films by choosing a film from the menu :)
* Photos are automatically saved in your album!

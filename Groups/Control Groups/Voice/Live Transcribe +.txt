Live Transcribe + speech-to-text app makes transcribing any live communication easy for friends, family, and organizations to be inclusive, accessible and ADA compliant!


Built for simplicity and ease of use. (Not associated with Google.)

All The Features are Available Freely on the Live Transcribe + until transcription is done for 5 times, then the features will require a paid subscription.

• Input audio via built-in mic or Bluetooth device
• Tap once and continuously transcribe from speech to text for as long as you’d like without limits (requires subscription after 5 times)
• Voice typing made easy


Capture Every Word
• Easily dictate on the mic and convert the voice to text using dictation
• The speaker can use bluetooth headphones for increased accuracy even in noisy environments

Easy to Read
• Focus on what’s being said
• Add new lines automatically or manually to break up the text
• Easily Read Text in Both Light and Dark Mode
• Export Text after dictation

Many Uses of Live Transcribe +

• Provide live captioning to deaf, hard-of-hearing, ESL people, and anyone with accessibility needs

To have access to the "Live Transcribe + Full Access" functionality, you can choose between a monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription. This is a recurring transaction that will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription. Renewals will be charged the same cost within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscriptions and auto-renewal can be turned off by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.

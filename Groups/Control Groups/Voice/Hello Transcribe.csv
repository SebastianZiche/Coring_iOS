6443919768,0,Hello Transcribe,Utilities,2022-10-28,2022-10-28,115.69,1,0,0,1,3.0.6,2023-10-25,Bottom toolbar icons are better spaced apart. Pro downloads will be disabled when Pro not purchased. Model configs: A model config configuration is a Whisper model combined with transcription and rendering options. Previously you could only set the Whisper model CoreML enabled etc. in Settings. This meant that changing the settings was awkward and you could not change them while doing a transcription. Now you can create multiple configs and use them for different tasks and change them while transcribing. Changing the config will restart the transcription. This means now you can: Have a fast default config to quickly transcribe something and change to a accurate config when you want a more accurate result. Tweak a config during transcription e.g. turn translation on off or change the audio language . Set your favourite config as the default and copy an existing config to tweak it. Two new advanced options have been added: Per word timestamps. This is experimental . Each word will have a timestamp. Beam search size. A smaller beam search is faster but will create less accurate results. Before 3.0 Hello Transcribe used the greedy search method which is the same as a search size of 1. Other: App will not go to sleep while a transcription is in progress.

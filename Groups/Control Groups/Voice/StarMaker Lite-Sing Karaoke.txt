    Hey StarMakers,

    In this release, we fixed a bug that was causing some of you to crash in the app. We also heard you that you want more control over how your videos save to YouTube. So, we've added a public on/off toggle right next to the UPLOAD button after every recording, giving you the control on each and every video you make.

    Here's how it works:

    Perfected your cover of Stay With Me and want to world to watch? 
    Leave the Public toggle "on" and hit UPLOAD. This will save your performance as public for all to admire.

    Love your recording, but not quite ready for others to see? 
    Toggle Public to "off" before selecting UPLOAD. This will save your performance, but only for your eyes.

    And, as always, you can change the privacy settings on your recordings at any time from your in-app profile page.

    Want ultimate control over your music? Join the StarMaker Network to publish to your own YouTube channel. Look for the JOIN message in-app and get your music career rolling!

Version 3.0.3 (Aug 11, 2014)
    WOW! We’re blown away by the star-quality music videos you all are making with our new VIDEO MODE! Check out some favorites on our The Voice: On Stage YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/TheVoiceOnStageUS

    We also pulled some talented singers from all of the AMAZING video submissions we received for our The Voice Mobile Audition and big things are already happening for them! Follow us on twitter (@starmakerapp) to watch it all unfold and to be in the know when we open the next round of Auditions for The Voice on NBC.

    Some of you have expressed your shy side and, while we think you’re always video star material, we get that everyone has a bad hair day sometimes. So we’ve made it easier for you to set individual recordings as public or private from your in-app profile. Tap the profile image at the top left of the app and use the cog icon on each song to manage its settings. We also fixed a bug that didn’t allow you to change your profile image in-app. Now, bad hair day or not, the power of your image is back in your hands!

    This release also fixes some rare yet pesky bugs keeping some of you from opening the app and/or singing. We also enhanced our mic sensitivity and allow you to set the right volume using the mic slider before you hit “record.”

    And while the general app and audio mode are available on iPod4 & iPhone4, the video mode is only available on iPod5+, iPhone 4S+, iPod2+ and on iOS 7. Nothing personal, it’s a device limitation thing!

    Oh, one last thing… the music production team would be mad if we didn’t also remind you that they are hard at work releasing songs on a DAILY basis. Check the app’s “NEW” section for all the latest!

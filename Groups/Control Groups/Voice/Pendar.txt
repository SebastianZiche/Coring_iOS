App Description
Never forget your ideas again! With Pendar you can quickly capture and organise the ideas that pop up in your head. Use the voice recorder to transcribe your thoughts and send them to your favourite to-do app or any other collection app.

Whether you are on a run, on your bike or in your car, ideas can come up anytime, anywhere. Pendar lets you quickly capture your ideas through voice, text or photos and save them. You can set up workflows that allow you to easily send them to the appropriate location to continue with the idea. Be it a to-do app or an issue logging tool. With one click you can send your ideas through!

PRIVACY
All ideas captured by Pendar are saved on your phone and to your personal iCloud storage (to which only you have access to), so nobody but you can access these.

Grid layout is mainly to help users with smaller phones who may prefer larger buttons. The F octave pitch pipe was added because two is better than one! Toggle mode was added just incase users don t like holding down the button. Blow mode was added because why the heck not. Now you can blow into your phone to play a pitch just like a real pitch pipe!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The original audio files are of a person blowing into an actual pitch pipe. This was used for people who would prefer that authentic sound instead of an electronic tone. It was discovered that some of the audio had some tuning variations at times of 10 Hz . This was most likely due to imperfections in the physical Pitch Pipe used in the recordings. This isn t a huge variation to the ears of a casual user but it was worth improving upon. The audio s pitches have been adjusted to now be within 2 Hz but most often it is less. Note: this is using 440Hz tuning If you find further problems with this audio please feel free to email me directly at johnpocketpitch yahoo.com. I would prefer to fix problems rather than have people dismiss the App. Thank you John Walbolt,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

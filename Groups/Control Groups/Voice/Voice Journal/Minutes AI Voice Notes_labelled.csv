Investigations revealed that the crashes were caused by the operating system terminating the app when a user exits it. Since transcription is a resource intensive task the system restricts apps from performing such tasks in the background. To mitigate this issue the update now cancels the transcription process when a user quits Minutes. However on slower devices and or larger models the cancellation may take more than a few seconds causing the app to be terminated anyway. A comprehensive solution is under development involving significant changes to the user workflow. As a temporary workaround to avoid app termination it is advised not to quit and reopen Minutes repeatedly while recording. For instance if you wish to conserve battery exit Minutes after starting the recording and only open the app to pause stop the recording. I apologise for any inconvenience caused!,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Previously excessively long summaries caused export failures. Loading indicators have been added to provide visual feedback during the process of regenerating transcript summaries and exporting them to Notion. A confirmation dialog will now appear when appropriate ensuring a smoother transcription experience. The alert will be presented in two main scenarios: 1. Before transcribing imported audio video files or downloaded YouTube videos. 2. Before starting a recording when low on credits. No confirmation is needed when the transcription is free e.g. Minutes Pro subscribers using offline models Minutes should now be available on Macs with Apple Silicon.

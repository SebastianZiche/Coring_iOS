App Description
Improve your child’s English with the Ben & Bella Karaoke Show app!

This lively and entertaining app offers you 3 original English-language songs, 1 of which will be downloaded automatically as soon as you install the app. You may download the other 2 with one quick click. In addition to the 3 basic songs, 6 others can be purchased within the app.

Each song is presented in a variety of videos, specially created to make learning the songs both easy and fun for your child: sing-along videos starring real-life children against an animated background as well as continuous and step-by-step instruction videos, in which the lyrics and their accompanying gestures are taught by a professional choreographer. The gestures that accompany the songs help to underline the meaning of the lyrics.

A karaoke function allows your child to record and then save his/her singing and combine it with a song video. In addition, a video recording function allows your child to tape himself/herself and thus become a singing star! Saved videos can be shared with friends.

This app also includes bonus animated video books related to the subject of each song.

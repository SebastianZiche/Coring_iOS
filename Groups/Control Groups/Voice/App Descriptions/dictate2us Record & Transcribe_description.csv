You can download the app for free and a 10 15 free trial credit is offered so you can test our typing service. When the trial credit has been used we then charge an audio minute rate depending on the turnaround chosen. You can add credit to your account using PayPal or a debit credit card. IMPORTANT: All users can record and edit audio files. To take advantage of the dictate2us transcription features you will need to register within the app which only takes 60 seconds! How does it work 1. The user records audio and saves a recording with the dictate2us app. 2. The audio is securely uploaded to the dictate2us transcription platform. 3. A dedicated typist transcribes the file into a Microsoft Word document. 4. An editor amends any errors or formatting issues. 5. The document is proofread to ensure accuracy. 6. The finished document is e mailed to you or made available for download. How do we charge for transcription We charge per minute of audio rather than per word line or time taken to type. We believe this is the fairest way as you will know exactly how much a file will cost before uploading. People dictate 3 to 4 times more quickly than they type. Thus a 10 minute dictation file could take up to 40 minutes to transcribe. With d2u you only pay for the 10 minutes. How long does it take to transcribe The d2u app allows users to get their transcribed documents back extremely quickly. As soon as your encrypted file arrives at our servers it is decrypted and assigned to your regular typist. Once edited and proofread our online transcription platform will e mail a copy of the finished document or if preferred a link can be sent to download the document straight to your phone tablet or PC. We return work in a Microsoft Word document and can type into your personal letterhead or template. Data Confidentiality and Security The d2u Transcriber app uses state of the art data security including military grade 256 bit encryption the same technology that used in online banking and retail websites. Our servers are UK based and hack tested daily. We are fully data protected with the ICO and fully HIPPA compliant. Our staff are office based and have signed non disclosure agreements. We do not employ homeworkers and our staff have no means to remove data from our systems.

This app combines a pitch pipe and piano so that you have two of the quintessential tools of a singer! The Pitch Pipe is its primary function. It uses professionally recorded sound so that the audio experience is just like carrying around a pitch pipe with you. The Keyboard allows for 6 octaves of pitches ideal for vocal warm ups or plunking out notes. The Info page allows the user to provide feedback directly to the developer. The goal is to make the best free mobile app for singers so input is greatly appreciated. A special thanks to the various contributors to Pocket Pitch: Md.

You have complete control over who sees what and for how long.

Your messages are sent just like regular SMS texts with several added layers of security to ensure no one else can track your conversations- from curious friends and family members all the way to the prying eyes of the NSA.

Gain full control of who sees your chats, for how long, and feel secure knowing it will be deleted permanently. Privatext doesn't simply hide messages from a device- it wipes all traces of the message forever. Keep your conversations private and join the communication revolution with Privatext.

Privatext Features:

Password - Protected Private Messaging App
Chat with anyone with Privatext about anything you want. Lock the app so only you can enter it. Each message you send has an adjustable lifespan that automatically erases whenever you want, from 30 seconds to 24 hours. Clear and delete whole messaging histories from your phone, your contact’s phone and Privatext servers with just one click. Every encoded message is wiped instantly, and kept private and for your eyes only.

Confirmation Texting
Never send a message to the wrong person again with Confirmation Texting. Privatext asks if you’d like to message the contact you selected, giving you the opportunity to cancel the text if you clicked the wrong name by mistake.

Send Pictures Securely in Private Messages
Share pictures between you and your contacts with an added layer of security. Upload pictures from your camera roll or take photos with the Privatext camera, where nothing will be saved to your phone. Send confidential images such as bank statements and signed papers with peace of mind. Treat photos like protected messages and adjust the lifespan of anything you send.

Invite Friends
Have conversations with anyone you want. Invite all your friends, families or coworkers to Privatext and keep the conversations going. Invite anyone through SMS, e-mail or Twitter and add people with their personalized Privatext PIN. Your real name or Facebook account isn’t required at sign up, keeping your identity private.

Ensure everything you send is safe behind a personal password in a secure messaging app. Don’t worry about leaked personal information or pictures - control everything from your phone.

Why run the risk of having information fall into the wrong hands? Enjoy the security and privacy provided to you by Privatext; download the app today.

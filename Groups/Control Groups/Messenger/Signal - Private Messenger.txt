App Description
Signal is a messaging app with privacy at its core. It is free and easy to use, with strong end-to-end encryption that keeps your communication completely private.

• Send texts, voice messages, photos, videos, GIFs, and files for free. Signal uses your phone’s data connection, so you avoid SMS and MMS fees.

• Call your friends with crystal-clear encrypted voice and video calls. Group calls supported for up to 40 people.

• Stay connected with group chats up to 1,000 people. Control who can post and manage group members with admin permission settings.

• Share image, text, and video Stories that disappear after 24 hours. Privacy settings keep you in charge of exactly who can see each Story.

• Signal is built for your privacy. We know nothing about you or who you’re talking to. Our open source Signal Protocol means that we can’t read your messages or listen to your calls. Neither can anyone else. No back doors, no data collection, no compromises.

• Signal is independent and not for profit; a different kind of tech from a different kind of organization. As a 501c3 nonprofit we are supported by your donations, not by advertisers or investors.

• For support, questions, or more information please visit https://support.signal.org/

What's New

Version 6.61.2 (Feb 29, 2024)
    • New emoji are coming soon, and this update adds preliminary support so that Signal will be ready for the future of visual communication as soon as that future arrives. People keep asking us what our favorite new emoji is, but answering that question is a “lime” we won't cross.
Version 7.0 (Feb 29, 2024)
    We’re introducing new ways to keep your phone number private on Signal.

    • Your phone number will no longer be visible to anyone on the latest version of Signal unless they have it saved in their phone’s contacts. You can change this in Settings.

    • You can now set and share an optional username to let people chat with you without giving them your phone number.

    • A new privacy setting lets you control who can find you by your phone number on Signal.
Version 6.61.1 (Feb 25, 2024)
    • New emoji are coming soon, and this update adds preliminary support so that Signal will be ready for the future of visual communication as soon as that future arrives. People keep asking us what our favorite new emoji is, but answering that question is a “lime” we won't cross.

    • New emoji are coming soon, and this update adds preliminary support so that Signal will be ready for the future of visual communication as soon as that future arrives. People keep asking us what our favorite new emoji is, but answering that question is a “lime” we won't cross.
Version 6.60 (Feb 15, 2024)
    • This Valentine's Day, we have good news if you're planning on getting back together with your iPad after taking a break: A bug that could cause Signal to crash when attempting to re-link an unlinked device has been fixed.
    • If you're in a relationship with multiple devices, group call notifications on your iPhone will be automatically dismissed when you answer that call on your iPad or Desktop.
Version 6.59 (Feb 8, 2024)
    • Now you can tap on someone's profile photo in a group chat and quickly see additional information like how many groups you have in common.
Version 6.58 (Feb 1, 2024)
    • If resolving a few small bugs counts as a New Year’s resolution, then 2024 is off to a fantastic start.
Version 6.57 (Jan 25, 2024)
    • If resolving a few small bugs counts as a New Year’s resolution, then 2024 is off to a fantastic start.
Version 6.57 (Jan 25, 2024)
    • If resolving a few small bugs counts as a New Year’s resolution, then 2024 is off to a fantastic start.
Version 6.56 (Jan 17, 2024)
    • If resolving a few small bugs counts as a New Year’s resolution, then 2024 is off to a fantastic start.
Version 6.54 (Dec 20, 2023)
    • We fixed a bug that caused muted chats that were marked as unread to still appear in the unread total on the Signal icon even when that setting was disabled. Now the badge count consistently ignores any conversations that you choose to consistently ignore.
    • This update also enables VoiceOver support for message reactions, stickers, and wallpaper color selections.
Version 6.54 (Dec 20, 2023)
    • We fixed a bug that caused muted chats that were marked as unread to still appear in the unread total on the Signal icon even when that setting was disabled. Now the badge count consistently ignores any conversations that you choose to consistently ignore.
    • This update also enables VoiceOver support for message reactions, stickers, and wallpaper color selections.
Version 6.53 (Dec 13, 2023)
    • Silence isn’t always golden, but it does have a new icon. We updated the Camera and Mute buttons in voice and video calls so it’s even easier to see when they are enabled or disabled.
    • There might already be a self-referential German word to describe “German words that are so big they won’t fit on a single line,” but we fixed the “lost cursor” bug that was affecting some long German words on iOS 17.
Version 6.52 (Dec 6, 2023)
    • This update fixes a rare keyboard bug that sometimes caused the app to crash. Even though this bug almost never happened, we believe that keyboards should only crash if you play the right note in the sound effect mode on an old synthesizer.
Version 6.51 (Dec 1, 2023)
    • We updated the contact sharing interface, so now you can send your friend the info for your favorite interior decorator on a screen that has already been redecorated. You can still select which fields to share for maximum feng shui too.
Version 6.50.1 (Nov 20, 2023)
    • We updated the contact sharing interface, so now you can send your friend the info for your favorite interior decorator on a screen that has already been redecorated. You can still select which fields to share for maximum feng shui too.
Version 6.50 (Nov 15, 2023)
    • We updated the contact sharing interface, so now you can send your friend the info for your favorite interior decorator on a screen that has already been redecorated. You can still select which fields to share for maximum feng shui too.
Version 6.49 (Nov 9, 2023)
    • In the halcyon world of user interface design, a "toast" is a tiny status message that briefly appears on the screen. After removing a contact in Signal, sometimes the confirmation message would get partially covered up by the keyboard (like a piece of toast stuck in the toaster). If you're on iOS 15+, please raise a glass and toast to never seeing that bug again. Cheers!
    • We also fixed a couple of broken animations in chats with a custom background.
Version 6.48 (Nov 2, 2023)
    • We’ve added a new way to keep your Signal contacts nice and tidy. This Halloween season, remove the ghost of an old contact by long-pressing on their name in the contact list on the New Chat screen and selecting the “Remove” option.
Version 6.47 (Oct 25, 2023)
    • We fixed a bug that sometimes caused re-registration to get stuck at 99%, which was 100% annoying if it happened to you. Thanks to everyone who helped us troubleshoot this problem.
    • We would also like to thank @ovakisan on GitHub for helping us reproduce and fix a crash that was occurring with some image attachments.
Version 6.46.1 (Oct 20, 2023)
    • We told ourselves that we would never do this, that we wouldn't be like the other apps with their lazy release notes, but this update really does include "bug fixes and performance improvements."
Version 6.45 (Oct 11, 2023)
    • Now you can edit a message with a long press after it has been sent! Fix a tpyo, include the missing ingredient in grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe, or add the punchline to a joke if you hit the send button too quickly. The choice is yours. Messages will always show when they have been edited, and you can tap on the "Edited" indicator to see the full edit history for any edited messages. Update the past in the present to prevent future confusion today!
Version 6.44 (Oct 4, 2023)
    • Now you can edit a message with a long press after it has been sent! Fix a tpyo, include the missing ingredient in grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe, or add the punchline to a joke if you hit the send button too quickly. The choice is yours. Messages will always show when they have been edited, and you can tap on the "Edited" indicator to see the full edit history for any edited messages. Update the past in the present to prevent future confusion today!
Version 6.43 (Sep 28, 2023)
    • Now you can edit a message with a long press after it has been sent! Fix a tpyo, include the missing ingredient in grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe, or add the punchline to a joke if you hit the send button too quickly. The choice is yours. Messages will always show when they have been edited, and you can tap on the "Edited" indicator to see the full edit history for any edited messages. Update the past in the present to prevent future confusion today!
    • Only you can truly find yourself, but we added a check mark badge that can help you find your “Note to Self.”
Version 6.42 (Sep 20, 2023)
    • We added an iconic new way to customize the look of Signal. Choose from a fun selection of fresh app icon options to change how Signal will appear on your home screen (Signal Settings > Appearance > App Icon).
    • The attachment selector has a brand-new design that is more compact and easier to use. If you start feeling attached to these improvements right away, that's OK because it's thematically appropriate.
    • For those of you who don't like AM or PM, it's time to smile. Now when your system settings are configured to display a 24-hour clock, the clock stickers in the media editor will be in 24-hour format too.
Version 6.41.1 (Sep 15, 2023)
    • We fixed a few bugs in the device transfer process just in case anyone is getting ready to announce some new phones soon.
Version 6.40 (Sep 7, 2023)
    • Now you can add stickers to pictures in the media editor to make them truly stick out. Put another bumper sticker on a picture of a car, add some sticker shock to a screenshot of Taylor Swift ticket prices, or spice up a photo of last night's dinner with a sticker of a pot sticker. And if you happen to live in the village of Sticker in South West England, you can find your favorite local wall and attach a sticker to its picture to become a virtual bill sticker in Sticker.
    • Show them the time of your life with new stickers in the media editor that let you add stylized time decorations on outgoing images too.
Version 6.39 (Aug 30, 2023)
    • The Signal iOS dev team may not be able to help you emotionally deal with the overwhelming weight of your own popularity, but we can fix a few more bugs that only affected people with extremely large contact lists.
Version 6.38 (Aug 24, 2023)
    • Every search result should feel like a highlight, but a bug was preventing the yellow highlight markers from being displayed for matches in individual chats unless the search result appeared in a message that also included a spoiler effect. Spoiler: That bug dies at the end of this update.
Version 6.37 (Aug 17, 2023)
    • This update fixes a couple of bugs related to @ mentions. Thanks to @AlexLucasBklyn on GitHub for their help!
Version 6.36 (Aug 10, 2023)
    • Format text in your messages by selecting any text in the message composition field. Make a bold statement that's actually bold, send M. Night Shyamalan a twist ending with a spoiler effect, emphasize a name by writing "Alex" in italics, put a line through a rejected dinner idea with strikethrough, or share code in monospace.
Version 6.35 (Aug 2, 2023)
    • Think fast. Improve your reaction time when replying to a Signal story. Now you can quickly scroll through recent emoji and send a reaction to someone’s story right away.
Version 6.34 (Jul 27, 2023)
    • Message reactions now support the latest emoji, so you can express your disbelief with "Shaking Face" or react with a "Pea Pod" when someone asks you how close you are to your friends.
    • We added a new (and optional) List mode in the All Media view. If you decide to go off the grid, now you can see more info at a glance, including file names, file sizes, dates, etc.
Version 6.33 (Jul 20, 2023)
    • If you've experienced bugs around chat color settings that made you want to use colorful language, we swear they're probably fixed.
Version 6.32 (Jul 13, 2023)
    • We updated the icons within the app to help improve legibility, especially if you live within the darkness of Dark Mode. The previous icons merely adopted the dark. These new icons were born in it, molded by it.
Version 6.31.1 (Jul 12, 2023)
    • We updated the icons within the app to help improve legibility, especially if you live within the darkness of Dark Mode. The previous icons merely adopted the dark. These new icons were born in it, molded by it.

Version 6.30 (Jun 28, 2023)
    • If you fix a couple of minor bugs that were related to @mention formatting and searching for new contacts, and you do it just after the summer solstice, does that still technically count as spring cleaning?
Version 6.29 (Jun 22, 2023)
    • Create a chain reaction by quickly selecting from the emojis that have already been added to a message. Or choose something new and unique if you don't want to look like you're overreacting.
    • Folders are now visible in the photo selector, so you can pick an attachment from a photo album instead of only seeing a photo amalgam.
    • We improved the progress bar, video controls, icons, and other elements in the media viewer. All work and no play have made Signal a little bit better whenever you push play.
Version 6.28 (Jun 15, 2023)
    • Create a chain reaction by quickly selecting from the emojis that have already been added to a message. Or choose something new and unique if you don't want to look like you're overreacting.

Version 6.26 (May 31, 2023)
    • We fixed a few obscure bugs in the registration process so that even more people can register for Signal without also registering their disappointment.
Version 6.25 (May 25, 2023)
    • Quickly spot your favorites in the attachment selector. If you’ve given your heart to a picture or a video in the Photos app, that symbol of your love will now appear in Signal too.
Version 6.24 (May 19, 2023)
    • Emoji search improvements make it easier to find the right way to say I love you using whatever heart-shaped emoji best matches the state of your own heart.
    • Photos in the attachment selector are now sorted based on how recently they were added to your device. Go ahead and download an old meme and share it with a new friend. Even if the picture was originally created several years ago, you won't have to scroll forever to spot it in the list anymore.
    • We'd like to express our sincere appreciation to @skjiisa for developing these features and submitting some of the best GitHub Pull Requests we've seen so far.
Version 6.23 (May 11, 2023)
    • We added a new (and optional) List mode in the All Media view. If you decide to go off the grid, now you can see more info at a glance, including file names, file sizes, dates, etc.
    • This release also includes several performance improvements and startup speed enhancements. If you have a lot of large conversations, or a lot of messages, we hope that you’ll notice a little difference.
Version 6.22 (Apr 26, 2023)
    • For those of you who like to listen closely, we improved earpiece proximity detection on newer iPhones. Now you can call someone without accidentally hanging up on them with your cheek as often, and you can also quietly play new voice notes without the screen shining in your ear too.
    • The media player looks a lot better in landscape mode, and we repositioned common playback controls so that things don’t feel so sideways even when your device is sideways.
    • If someone @mentions you in a reply to a group story, you’ll get notified as expected.
    • We added support for line wraps for long profile names, and now the entire name will appear instead of being partially truncated with an ellipsis. You can still deliberately include an ellipsis in your profile name if you want to be “Mysterious…”
Version 6.21 (Apr 20, 2023)
    • We searched for a way to improve search performance, so now you can find the right chat without needing to find as much patience.
Version 6.20 (Apr 13, 2023)
    • Now you can quickly see how many images or videos will be included when you forward an album, and you can also choose to cancel the process and wait for a WiFi connection before re-sharing 47 pictures from a recent birthday party. If today is your birthday, happy birthday from Signal.
Version 6.19.2 (Apr 8, 2023)
    • Hot on the heels of their introduction in the last release, the fast-forward and rewind icons for long videos have been updated to look slightly fast-er and a bit more rewind-er.
    • Long captions in the media viewer can now be expanded with a tap, which lets you see more of the image if your friend sends a picture worth a thousand words with a rambling caption that’s also a thousand words.
Version 6.19 (Apr 5, 2023)
    • Hot on the heels of their introduction in the last release, the fast-forward and rewind icons for long videos have been updated to look slightly fast-er and a bit more rewind-er.
    • Long captions in the media viewer can now be expanded with a tap, which lets you see more of the image if your friend sends a picture worth a thousand words with a rambling caption that’s also a thousand words.
Version 6.18 (Mar 29, 2023)
    • The magic of VHS and Betamax technology from the 1970s is now available in the palm of your hand. Revolutionary new Fast Forward and Rewind buttons will appear on long videos (30 seconds or more) so you can skip to the good parts or get back to something you missed.
Version 6.17 (Mar 22, 2023)
    • Share more things from more places. The share extension now has better support for the text format that various popular news apps share by default. We also squashed a bug that sometimes caused your first attempt to fail when sharing something.

    • Speaking of sharing, another bug was making it difficult to share text content from other apps like Apple Notes as Signal Stories. Text has arguably been an important component of some of the best stories throughout history, so we're excited to close the chapter on this particular problem.

    • New animation improvements in the media and avatar viewers let you smoothly step back and see the big picture.

    • We fixed a couple of layout issues that could cause buttons to show up in the wrong place on new iPhones, like invisible castaways marooned underneath Apple's Dynamic Island.

    • This update also includes support for Cantonese and Uyghur.

    • Share more things from more places. The share extension now has better support for the text format that various popular news apps share by default. We also squashed a bug that sometimes caused your first attempt to fail when sharing something.

    • This update also includes support for Cantonese and Uyghur.
Version 6.12 (Mar 3, 2023)
    • The new and improved All Media view makes it easier to spot old GIFs in your favorite chats, keep track of where you are in the timeline while scrolling, and see the length of individual videos.
    • We fixed a few bugs, including one that sometimes made an endless progress spinner appear while trying to leave a group. If you have been enthusiastically trying to escape from an "Escape Room Enthusiasts" group, the puzzle has been solved and the door is now open.
Version 6.11 (Feb 8, 2023)
    • Even though the “Find by Phone Number” feature is now more than 4x faster, you can still take your time when you decide to start a new conversation.
    • We fixed a few bugs, including one that sometimes caused the text input field to be displayed incorrectly when replying to a story.
Version 6.10 (Feb 1, 2023)
    • We heard that it was sometimes difficult to search for and share a location in a chat, so we searched for the bug and we're happy to share that it's fixed.
Version 6.9 (Jan 26, 2023)
    • If you routinely miss calls when your phone is in another room, you'll be happy to hear that unread missed call events in individual (non-group) chats will be automatically marked as read when you answer or decline on the 2nd, or 3rd, or 27th attempt. Sometimes persistence pays off for everyone involved, especially if one of your friends is accidentally going for the pocket-dial world record.
    • We fixed a few bugs, including one that occasionally made part of the interface look transparent while browsing through your contact list. Now you can only metaphorically see right through some of the people you know.
Version 6.8 (Jan 19, 2023)
    • We improved the way that information about incoming, outgoing, and missed calls is displayed and synchronized across linked devices. Now you can make the right call about all of the calls you didn't answer in time.
    • The "All Media" view has been optimized to let you scroll through the past much faster in the future.
    • Performance enhancements for audio calls in low-bandwidth environments will help you stay connected to a great conversation even when your connection isn't great.
Version 6.7 (Jan 12, 2023)
    • Keep your muted & archived chats quiet permanently by going to Settings > Chats > Keep Muted Chats Archived. You won’t receive any alerts, buzzes, or pings when you get a new message in a chat you’ve already muted and archived.
    • When you send a message to a chat that you’ve archived, it will automatically un-archive for you.
    • Other bug fixes and performance improvements.
Version 6.6 (Dec 14, 2022)
    • When you start a group call for small groups (up to 16 people), you can choose to send a ringing notification. Group members will hear a ring if their Signal app is up to date.

    • The bug where large stickers wouldn't automatically download is no longer creating sticky situations. Stickers were meant to get stuck, but not like this.

Version 5.7 (Mar 8, 2021)
    • We redesigned lots of screens within the app, and even more will be updated soon. If you're reading these release notes on a plane that is flying back from Paris Fashion Week, go ahead and download this update before you take off to help our hot new 2021 looks make a last-minute runway debut.
    • If you've been searching for an option that you can't seem to find, just retrace your steps with the new and improved Signal Settings menu. It's probably wherever you set it last.
    • Bandwidth shouldn't be the limiting factor that determines whether or not you can talk to someone (unless it's emotional bandwidth) so this release includes a few tweaks to help low-bandwidth calls perform even better.

Version 5.6 (Mar 1, 2021)
    • Between the improvements in this update and the improvements in the last update, Signal can now process 16,500% more messages per second. Now you can immediately see the mountain of unread messages that arrived while your cellular reception was taking a hike.
    • Incoming video calls weren't always ringing for some users on iOS 14, but we aren't hung up on this bug anymore.
    • People with tons and tons of contacts may still struggle to handle the weight of their own popularity, but Signal no longer makes them wait as long or struggles to handle their super-large address books.

Version 5.5.0 (Feb 22, 2021)
    • This update improves the onboarding experience for new Signal users. If you’ve already been using Signal for a long time, feel free to invite a new friend and then ask them to tell you all about it.
    • We made message processing significantly faster, so you can fly through your message backlog after your flight lands, or quickly power through what you missed while you were looking for a power outlet.
    • We filled in the blanks with bug fixes for stickers and delivery receipt checkmarks that weren’t always appearing for some users.
Version 5.4 (Feb 8, 2021)
    • This update introduces a few major accessibility enhancements, including VoiceOver descriptions of conversation messages.
    • Even if your thumbs are slow, sending messages will still be faster whenever you tap the send button in large groups.
    • The new design for the attachment upload and download progress indicators might look even better than the attachment that they sent you.
    • Several low-memory crashes have become distant-memory crashes, so you can forget about them.

Version 5.3.2 (Feb 3, 2021)
    • Chat wallpapers have arrived! Choose unique wallpapers for individual chats (you may as well type on a heart-filled wallpaper if they're your type on paper) or just set one default background for everyone if your patience is wallpaper thin.
    • This update includes support for animated stickers along with the first official animated Signal sticker pack, "Day by Day" by Miguel Ángel Camprubí. You can create your own APNG animated sticker packs in Signal Desktop, and now you can share sticker packs with multiple chats too!

    • If they're a big deal to you, tap on their profile photo to see them in a full-screen view.

    • Automatically pause attachment downloads while a call is in progress. Deciding to wait doesn't need to feel like such a weight because you can pause and resume attachment downloads whenever you want.

    • Expanded chat list previews display the sender's name in group chats so it's easier to decide which threads to look at first.

    • We fixed a few bugs that were reported to us by the beta community and people who are really fast at downloading new things.

Version 5.2 (Jan 13, 2021)
    This update is filled with dozens of changes! Here are a few highlights:

    • Adjust your media download preferences to control when attachments get downloaded (Settings > Data Usage).
    • We added support for longer group names in languages like Hindi where the previous limit was too small.
    • We raised the group call limit from 5 to 8, so now you can call it even.
    • Share something funny from other apps with multiple Signal chats at the same time.
    • Use the optional shortcut to enable a shareable group link when you create a new group.
    • Additional file attachments can now be opened right from within the app.
    • Now you can easily see the latest Signal profile photo that your contacts have chosen, but we added an option to always show system profile photos if you prefer the old behavior (or start to miss the blurry photo of them from 9 years ago that has travelled across multiple SIM cards).
    • Video quality and size improvements.
    • We fixed a bug that prevented iPad users from tapping Send when sharing content from other apps, and another bug that prevented WebP images from sending properly on iOS 14.

Version 5.1 (Jan 10, 2021)
    Our motivation was the acceleration of every single conversation with a fixation on the duration of the scrolling presentation and the transformation of slow frustration and aggravation into exhilaration and elation as the sensation of pagination and navigation defies your every expectation. We have nothing but appreciation for the beta testers whose determination and cooperation deserve a standing ovation for helping with this renovation.

    • A new and improved interface for voice and video calls. Dial a friend without jumping through as many hoops, even though there still might be multiple rings.
    • Easily start a video call with a new shortcut that's a more visible way to be visible.
    • Picture-in-picture support within the app keeps your Signal calls in focus even if you focus on another conversation. It isn't multitasking if they still have your undivided attention.
    • Quickly see details like mute status and timers in the conversation header so you don't need to keep them in your head.
    • iPad users with a Magic Keyboard can make more magic happen with the trackpad, like swiping to dismiss a photo in the media view.

Version 3.13.3 (Aug 3, 2020)

    • You can now send and receive voice and video calls from your linked iPad.
    • Sometimes your emojions just can’t be contained, so we’ve removed the message bubble on short emoji only messages.
    • If boundless emoji aren’t enough, you can now send memoji and other stickers directly via the keyboard.
    • Not everyone has earned the right to live in your address book, but that doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to hear from you. You’ll now see all approved contacts as options when starting a new conversation or editing a group.
    • Incoming calls will no longer ring your device when you haven’t approved the caller. They’ll be notified their call was rejected because you haven’t accepted their request.
    • Now you can put a pin in PINs and disable them completely. This option is for advanced users who don't want to lose their ability to lose everything.

Version 3.12.4 (Jul 8, 2020)
    • The badge count on the app icon now excludes new messages in muted threads and also gets updated when a thread is marked as unread. In other words, numbers after a mute point are a moot point, and you'll see a red "1" when you unread someone.
    • Even though the changes are completely unrelated to fast money, the cache performance improvements in this release still help the app feel like a million bucks.
    • In ancient times, you'd have to use stones or weights to keep the paper from curling up past where you wanted it to be, but these are modern times so we just added a feature that automatically maintains your scroll position.
    • We updated the message retry user interface so it's easy to try again without trying your patience.

Version 3.11.1 (Jun 22, 2020)
    • Additional optimizations to speed up message delivery and the overall feel of the app.
    • Jump for joy instead of jumping for no reason. We fixed several bugs related to scrolling performance and behavior.
    • What was it like when images in incoming photo albums were occasionally shown in the wrong sequence? What emotions did you experience when the badge count display sometimes didn't update? These questions are now both historical *and* rhetorical, because we fixed both of those bugs too.

Version 3.10.5 (Jun 10, 2020)
    • Quickly invite someone from one group to join another group (possibly one that is even more exclusive). Tap on their photo, select the new "Add to group" button, and they're in – no secret handshake necessary.
    • We want the app to be fast so we left even more performance bottlenecks in the past.
Version 3.10.4 (Jun 9, 2020)
    • In order to help new users troubleshoot missing message notifications, we added dismissable reminders that explain how to enable (or re-enable) app permissions.
    • No need to double-check for the double check. We fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the second delivery checkmark from appearing until you returned to the conversation list or sent or received another message.
Version 3.10.3 (Jun 8, 2020)
    • Faster message sending in large groups and various improvements to the group conversation interface make it quicker to socialize and organize with lots of people.
    • New performance enhancements help the app feel more responsive, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to be more responsive too.
Version 3.10.2 (Jun 6, 2020)
    • Use the new blur feature in the image editor to give every face a hiding place, or draw a fuzzy trace over something you want to erase.
    • Feeling Emojionally unavailable? Now you can react to messages with any Emoji. Wave back when someone new says hello in your group chat, use a cricket if nobody laughs at a joke, or fire for a particularly hot take. The choice is yours.
    • Channel your inner procrastinator and mark any thread as unread.
    • We fixed a bug that prevented iPad users from viewing media while split-screen multitasking. Now you can keep your friend's picture of a sunset on one side of the screen and write a journal entry about how it makes you feel on the other.

    • Landscape mode is enabled throughout the application so you can live your life in widescreen.
    • Search results are returned much faster when you’re starting a new conversation. This is particularly helpful if you have 37 people named “Mary” in your contacts.
Version 2.34.0 (Jan 25, 2019)
    • Quickly send multiple pictures and videos. Share an album of albums to show off your vintage vinyl collection. Caption several seemingly identical photographs of majestic sunsets from your recent vacation and deliver them all at once.
    • Say "Olá" to improved formatting for Brazilian phone numbers.
Version 2.33.1 (Jan 12, 2019)
    • We added a new disappearing messages timer indicator. The old one has disappeared.

    • Optional support for Typing Indicators. The dots between the lines help you read between the lines.
    • We revamped Signal's sending logic to improve performance in poor network conditions. Step into that top-floor elevator and lose reception with confidence, because the number of times that you'll need to manually retry is also going down.
    • Signal now looks better than ever on the iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR.
    • Take advantage of the new landscape media support. Turn your phone sideways while viewing pictures and videos. Be rebellious and watch a portrait video in landscape if you have fallen in love with videos that don't use your entire screen.

    • We fixed a bug that prevented VoiceOver from working properly with the Settings icon.

Version 2.31.2 (Dec 3, 2018)
    • Support for "sealed sender" messages: https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/
    • Voice memos can now be played through the earpiece speaker. Hold your phone up to your face and it's almost like they are right there whispering to you.
    • You were already lovely before, but the default avatar quality level has been increased even more.
    • We turned the tables and said "Stop! Freeze!" to a few rare bugs that were sometimes causing that to happen.
    • We fixed a bug that was generating error messages for users who had censorship circumvention enabled.
    * This update fixes a few bugs related to delivery receipts and indicators.
Version 2.31.1 (Nov 30, 2018)
    • Support for "sealed sender" messages: https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/

Version 2.30.2 (Oct 18, 2018)
    • Sometimes it's easier to say things in the dark, but are you brave enough to enable the new theme? The full moon won't appear in the night sky until October 24th, but you can look for the moon icon in the top-right corner of your Signal Settings today.
    • The conversation screen is now displayed instantly when you tap on a contact to start a new thread. Say something new to someone new before you even have a chance to lose your nerve.
Version 2.29.3 (Sep 18, 2018)
    • We fixed a bug that prevented the photo avatar for a group conversation from being set.
    • Group conversations can now be blocked.

Version 2.29.2 (Sep 9, 2018)
    • We fixed a rare bug where calls with users on other platforms sometimes would not connect. Romeo and Juliet came from different families, and if we learned anything from that story it's that everyone deserves a chance to say "I love you" even if their device lacks hardware H.264 support.
    • Performance improvements for thumbnail generation mean that most larger images will no longer be displayed as a generic file icon.

    • See more of your inbox. The search field is tucked away until you need it, but it's always easy to find above the first conversation.
    • Our jumbo emoji now match the size of the jumbo emoji in other apps. We didn't make them any bigger because we're actively trying to avoid an arms race.
    • App Store reviews are easier to submit using Apple's built-in ratings API, and reminders will appear a lot less frequently.
    • We fixed an issue where headers in the media gallery weren't appearing correctly on the iPhone X. If you ever thought this visual glitch was because of something you did, please know that it's notch your fault.

Version 2.27.1 (Jul 9, 2018)
    • Contact sharing is now available. You can lead a friend to another friend, but you cannot make them friends. You can send a friend the number for your favorite pizza place, but they still might order pineapple.
    • Some users on older versions of iOS would occasionally see a big blank square instead of their inbox. This accidental abstract art has been fixed.
    • We added some reliability improvements to the desktop linking experience.
    • We fixed some screens that were difficult to use on an iPad and the iPhone 4.
Version 2.27.0 (Jul 2, 2018)
    • Find your new favorite feature. Full-text search is everything that you have been looking for. Quickly locate contacts, conversations, or even specific messages.
    • Users with a very large number of contacts will notice improved performance, especially while using the share extension.
    • We upgraded to the latest version of WebRTC for enhanced call quality.
Version 2.26.0 (Jun 20, 2018)
    • Significant call performance and reliability improvements.
    • Access your inbox and send or receive messages while you are on a Signal call. How many simultaneous conversations can you participate in before it no longer feels like you are paying attention to any of them? Our record is 6, but now we only have 5 friends.
    • We fixed a bug that could cause the app to stop responding. Swiping right in the conversation list no longer matches you with a freeze.
    • You wanted more speed (and we agreed):
    • Send messages faster than ever with a new WebSocket-enabled delivery pipeline.
    • Conversations load in a fraction of the time. Wait for inspiration instead of waiting to see what was already said.

    Signal is made for you. Thank you for your feedback and support.
Version 2.25.3 (Jun 8, 2018)
    • Fixes an issue where some disappearing messages were not deleted. All affected messages will be deleted after upgrade.
    • If the "Invite Your Friends" feature wasn't working for you, we invite you to try again.
    • Switch between the front and back cameras during video calls. Will they see the look on your face or look at what you're facing? The choice is yours.
    • Speaking of faces, we added a note explaining why we use Face ID that is required on updated versions of iOS.
    • Profile avatars are now visible in the conversation nav bar.
    • We made some additional improvements to Signal's Dynamic Type support.
    • The conversation list now scrolls so smoothly that you might want to message distant acquaintances in order to make it even longer.
    • Assorted stability enhancements and bug fixes.

Version 2.24.1 (Apr 30, 2018)
    • Quoted Replies have arrived. Talk about the past without repeating it on your keyboard. Wake up suddenly in the middle of the night and deliver the perfect comeback to a joke from four days ago.
    • We fixed a rare issue where some users could not see their old messages.
    • An updated design gives Signal a fresh new look that still feels familiar.
    • Images and captions are displayed within the same message. We referred to this project as "bubble collapse" but we think that you'll refer to it as "so much better."
    • It's easier to access the dedicated viewer for extremely lengthy messages. We also resolved the issue where long text messages were sometimes partially cropped.
    • Signal's revamped layouts now fully support Dynamic Type. If you have previously adjusted the desired font size in your iOS Settings, you no longer have to adjust your expectations.
    • We corrected the lingering views for iPhone X users where content wasn't always visually flowing behind the Home indicator (and that's the bottom line).
    • New message sounds will play at the alert volume instead of the media volume within the app.
    • They say that you only get one chance to make a first impression, but we're really hoping that's not true because the Signal logo was sometimes slightly misaligned on the initial launch screen in previous releases.
    • We fixed an issue that would prevent the app from opening after receiving a malformed message. Thanks to Michael Straßburger for reporting this bug.
    • Assorted stability enhancements and bug fixes.

Version 2.23.4 (Apr 17, 2018)
    This update resolves an issue that was preventing some users from answering incoming Signal calls. It also fixes a crash when using censorship circumvention.
Version 2.23.3 (Apr 14, 2018)
    This release includes comprehensive bug fixes for additional ways of bypassing the new Screen Lock feature. These bugs were discovered internally and also reported by Adam Cianflone and Justin Davis.

    Previously:

    • Unlock Signal's screen without lifting a finger (from the Touch ID sensor that is now optionally supported): Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen Lock.
    • Have a staring contest with your iPhone X (and win). The infrared Face ID camera always blinks first, and Signal supports that too.
    • You can stop watching a boring video before it ends without occasionally crashing Signal. If it's an eleven-minute video, just wait at least that long before responding so your friend thinks that you watched the whole thing.
    • Explore a virtual museum of memories in any conversation with the new "All Media" view, then ruthlessly curate your virtual museum with the raw power of batch delete.
    • Use gestures to quickly scroll through images and videos. Signal supports left and right swipes because the carousel of life moves in both directions.
Version 2.23.2 (Apr 8, 2018)
    This release fixes a bug that made it possible to bypass the new Screen Lock feature. Thanks to Leonardo Porpora for reporting this issue.

Version 2.22.0 (Mar 15, 2018)
    • You can enable an optional Registration Lock PIN that will be required in order to register your phone number with Signal again.
    • We resolved another issue that caused profile pictures to flicker. If this was happening to the profile picture of someone you love, hopefully now they can be a solid presence in your life *and* in Signal.
    • Some rare background crash scenarios would cause Signal to forget about in-progress draft messages and to launch more slowly during multitasking. Like all good backgrounds, these crashes are now behind us.
Version 2.21.0 (Mar 9, 2018)
    • What does privacy sound like? Now you can choose. Select from a variety of audio options for your Signal notifications. You can also pick a unique message tone for your favorite conversations.
    • Signal’s notification settings were simplified. There’s now a unified option to control what appears in your notifications for both messages and calls.
    • We made some performance improvements to the way that calls are connected. Even if you speak slowly, you can start talking faster.
Version 2.20.2 (Mar 1, 2018)
    New in 2.20.2 — More applications are now supported by the share extension. We also fixed a couple of rare crashes and are now correctly syncing a group's disappearing message status to Signal Desktop.

    New in 2.20.0 —

    • Now you can share content with Signal from other applications. Send someone a great picture from Photos, the perfect link from Safari, or a song from your favorite streaming app. Share without any insecurity. This feeling of confidence was inside you the whole time.
    • Add captions to your attachments before you send them. The best attachments are the ones that require an explanation.
    • Improved audio handling means that Signal will automatically resume playing your music after you place a call, play a voice note, or view a video message.
    • Send full-size images without any additional compression by tapping on the attachment icon, selecting Document, and choosing Photo Library. Send your friend an enormous high-resolution file that definitively proves to them that it wasn’t just some random guy in the park and was actually a long-distance Tom Hanks photobomb.
    • Enable and disable Disappearing Messages using a new stopwatch icon.
    • Searching for contacts in the compose screen also searches profile names.
    • Signal launches faster than ever and uses the latest version of WebRTC for improved call performance.
    • Swiping to get back to the inbox from a conversation thread is so much easier.
    • The list of supported languages has expanded to include Traditional Chinese and Estonian. We sincerely appreciate the volunteer translators whose efforts made this possible.

    We said farewell to the following bugs:

    • Tapping on images in the media view would sometimes cause them to move around a bit before the navigation bars disappeared. Images now remain frozen in place as the glorious darkness of the full-screen media view surrounds them.
    • The initial hourglass rendering that is displayed underneath each Disappearing Message had a pixel that was out of place. Even when they're only tiny dots on a screen, every single grain of sand is important.
    • The VoiceOver accessibility feature in iOS no longer stops working after recording a voice memo.
    • Real people don’t flicker. Now the profile avatars that represent those people don’t flicker either.
    • Signal calls that are placed on speakerphone from the lock screen will now correctly indicate that the speakerphone is active in the app as well.
    • A rare issue could occur with the disappearing message timer on a newly linked Signal Desktop device, but that’s not the world we live in anymore.
    • Messages would sometimes disappear if you were looking at the info screen when a read receipt arrived.
    • The app would become unresponsive if you tried to send a photo after denying Signal access to your photo library.
    • Some characters that used to look strange in lock screen notifications now look totally normal. You’d never even suspect that anything about them is different.
    • If you killed the app at precisely the right moment, you might find yourself unable to message certain users. This game of chance was difficult to play (and the victory prize wasn’t very fun) so we decided to get rid of it.

    • Users with external keyboards can send messages using Shift+Return or Cmd+Return. Reaching up and tapping the send icon remains an option for anyone who reminisces about the past.
    • The list of supported languages has expanded to include Burmese, Hebrew, and Persian. We sincerely appreciate the volunteer translators whose efforts made this possible.


    We said farewell to the following bugs:

    • Under rare circumstances, message drafts could mysteriously vanish.
    • Adjacent message statuses behaved incorrectly after deleting a message.
    • Users who were simultaneously running the desktop version of Signal could receive redundant notifications.
    • Edit items might be missing from the long-press menu.
    • The input toolbar could remain raised even when no keyboard was visible.
    • Recently sent messages sometimes reappeared after being deleted.

App Description
Element is both a secure messenger and a team collaboration app that is ideal for group chats while remote working. This chat app uses end-to-end encryption to provide powerful video conferencing, file sharing and voice calls.

Element’s features include:
- Advanced online communication tools
- Fully encrypted messages to allow safer corporate communication, even for remote workers
- Decentralized chat based on the Matrix open source framework
- Secure file sharing with encrypted data while managing projects
- Group Video chat with voice over IP and screen sharing
- Easy integration with your favourite online collaboration tools, project management tools, VoIP services and other team messaging apps

Element is different from other messaging and collaboration apps. It operates on Matrix, an open network for secure and decentralized communication. It allows self-hosting to give users maximum ownership and control of their data and messages.

Privacy and encrypted messaging:
Element protects you from unwanted ads, data mining and walled gardens. It also secures all your data, one-to-one video chats and voice communication through end-to-end encryption and cross-signed device verification.

Element gives you control over your privacy while allowing you to communicate securely with anyone on the Matrix network, or other business collaboration tools by integrating with productivity apps such as Slack.

Element can be self-hosted:
To allow more control of your sensitive data and conversations, Element can be self-hosted or you can choose any Matrix-based host - the standard for open source, decentralized communication. Element gives you privacy, security compliance and integration flexibility.

Own your data:
You decide where to keep your data and messages. Without the risk of data mining or access from third parties.

Element puts you in control in different ways:
1. Get a free account on the matrix.org public server hosted by the Matrix developers, or choose from thousands of public servers hosted by volunteers
2. Self-host your account by running a server on your own IT infrastructure
3. Sign up for an account on a custom server by simply subscribing to the Element Matrix Services hosting platform

Open messaging and collaboration:
You can chat with anyone on the Matrix network, whether they’re using Element, another Matrix app or even if they are using a different messaging app.

Super secure:
Real end-to-end encryption (only those in the conversation can decrypt messages), and cross-signed device verification.

Complete communication and integration:
Messaging, voice and video calls, file sharing, screen sharing and a whole bunch of integrations, bots and widgets. Build rooms, communities, stay in touch and get things done.

Pick up where you left off:
Stay in touch wherever you are with fully synchronised message history across all your devices and on the web at https://app.element.io

    • Threads: Now available in Labs, threads help you to cut out the noise in busy rooms.

    • Landing Screen: We’ve given the first screen for new users a fresh coat of paint.
    • Location sharing: Now enabled by default for all users.

    On top of all of this, some of the most annoying bugs have been fixed; such as that one where rooms weren’t scrolling all the way to the bottom and that other one where the home screen wasn’t always sorted correctly.

    A quick bug fix version to fix a problem where sometimes Riot wouldn't display notifications for messages.
Version 0.6.6 (Dec 22, 2017)
    This release fixes one major issue with push notifications and one minor issue for the display of some Matrix Apps (like TradingView).
    Call invite lifetime has been increased from 30s to 60s so that you have more time to answer a call.
Version 0.6.4 (Dec 7, 2017)
    Just a minor update to fix some devices which started showing key share requests from a 'null' device.
Version 0.6.3 (Dec 1, 2017)
    Another exciting update: Riot now supports key sharing! What's that, I hear you ask? Well, it means that now, if you use end-to-end encryption, Riot will share the keys for encrypted messages between all of your devices. That means if you're able to decrypt history on one device, you should now be able to see it on all your devices. Don't worry, Riot is always very careful with your keys and will only ever send them to devices you've verified, so if you haven't yet verified your other devices, you'll see a prompt letting you do so whenever a device asks for keys.

    There's also a collection of other bug fixes (naturally) such as making the keyboard dark in the dark theme and fixing attachments from iCloud.
Version 0.6.2 (Nov 15, 2017)
    Over the summer, we've been very lucky to have two students from Google's Summer of Code programme making Riot even better. Excitingly, this release contains all their improvements which include:

    * Calls now use the proper incoming call screen, even if your phone is locked
    * You can now share photos, videos and other with Riot straight from other apps with the share sheet
    * Talk to Riot with Siri! You can tell Siri to place calls and send messages.
    * Contents of encrypted messages can now optionally be shown in notifications

    And of course our regular team has been busy fixing bugs.
Version 0.5.6 (Oct 10, 2017)
    We update the app regularly so we... nah, just kidding; we went & landed all-new video conferencing support. How's that? Voice and video conferencing is now powered by Jitsi, bringing more features, better reliability and better quality. You can still join old-style conferences, but heads up that anyone who hasn't updated won't be able to join conferences started from the new version.

    There's also an all-new incoming call screen and support for a helpful little guy we call Riot-bot. Plus, translations into Basque and Simplified Chinese.

    And of course, it supports iOS 11.
Version 0.5.3 (Sep 6, 2017)
    By popular demand, Riot now has a dark theme! Flip it on in settings to make the display easier on the eyes at night time, for dark places or just for extra stealth. Also it'll save some battery power if you happen to have a phone with the appropriate type of screen...

    We also fixed a crash that happened the first time you try to send a photo.
Version 0.5.2 (Aug 10, 2017)
    Translations! Thanks to lots of people in our awesome community, Riot can now speak Dutch, German and French!

    Oh, but there's more. Riot now supports audio attachments and supports the user search API which makes it much easier to find who you want to talk to (in other words, you don't have to remember their username). Oh, and now room joins and leaves will be collapsed together unless you tap on them to expand them. Good for people who enter a room, forget what they came in for and then leave again. Hey, it happens with age.

    Also messages with just emoji are bigger, because what's better than a smiley poo? A massive smiley poo, that's what.
Version 0.4.2 (Jul 7, 2017)
    Riot's had a makeover! The new home screen shows you more of your conversations at a glance so you can pick up right where you left off. Want to get more specific? See your favourites in their own tab, your direct chats and contacts in another and your group chats in the 'rooms' tab.

    As if that wasn't enough for one release, you can also see exactly where you read up to last time in a room, on any of your devices. Plus of course, lots more little features and bug fixes.
Version 0.3.13 (Mar 27, 2017)
    Riot now supports registering your phone number with your account, so now you can find contacts on Riot from your phone book as well as your email address book!

    We've also made a whole load of improvements to end to end encryption to make it more reliable and simpler to use, including warning you if sending an encrypted message would mean sending it to devices you've never seen before.
Version 0.3.9 (Feb 15, 2017)
    * Import and export your end to end encryption keys
    * Massively improve disk usage. Now Riot should take up a lot less space on your phone.

    And of course we fixed a load of bugs, including one where it would get stuck at the loading screen sometimes. Also one where messages appeared to take much longer to send than they actually did.
Version 0.3.8 (Jan 27, 2017)
    Lots of fixes for end to end encryption and improvements to looking up Matrix contacts from your address book, in preparation for something new...
Version 0.3.4 (Nov 24, 2016)
    In this version, we're enabling cross-platform end-to-end encryption functionality, plus a whole lot of tweaks and improvements. Looking for a file you were sent? There's now a 'files' tab in the search screen so it's much simpler to find. If you've been missing the 'direct chat' labels from the web version, those have now come to the app. Plus, of course, lost of bug fixes like accepting auto-completions when you hit send.

    As always, if you have any problems using the app, come and talk to us in #riot:matrix.org !
Version 0.2.3 (Oct 4, 2016)
    Vector is now Riot! Did we mention that? Probably. Did we mention Vector now supports voice and video calling too!? And now sending video messages!

    In this particular release, we just fixed a bug where the app would crash on some room links. Oops.

    But, VoIP calling!
Version 0.2.2 (Sep 30, 2016)
    Did you miss the news? Vector is now Riot! As well as a new name and a new look, Riot now supports voice and video calling!

    Just in case that wasn't enough, in this release we've added video sending! Just hold down the shutter button in the camera to record a video.

    A couple of bugs also snuck in while the app was having its makeover, in particular, loading spinners that never stopped on the login and registration screens. That's fixed now.
Version 0.2.1 (Sep 19, 2016)
    Vector is now Riot! Welcome to the future of real-time collaboration.

    There's much more than just a new name and a new look though, Riot now has voice and video calling! What's more you can join a voice or video conference: set up a conference in any room and anyone in that room can join the call, right from the app.

    Text communication has got better too: Riot now supports rich text messages, making your typing more expressive. Rooms can now be set up so that you can see the messages in them without even having to join: perfect for checking out a room before jumping in!

    And of course, bug fixes too numerous to mention here.
Version 0.1.10 (Jun 5, 2016)
    Lots and lots of bug fixes and polish - see https://github.com/vector-im/vector-ios/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#changes-in-vector-ios-in-0110-2016-06-04 for the full details.
Version 0.1.6 (May 5, 2016)

App Description
ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OTR and OMEMO encryption over XMPP. You can create new accounts on public XMPP servers, or even connect to your own server for extra security.

Unlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR, OMEMO and XMPP.

ChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.

* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.
* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.
* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.
* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.
* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios

Version 4.2.0 (Oct 24, 2017)
    # What's new in 4.2.0
    * Improved group chat reliability
    * Media sharing in group chats (unencrypted only)
    * Redesigned group participants view
    * Improve performance of chat view. Thanks @stigger!
    * Bug fixes and refactoring
    * Tor 0.3.0.11

    Changelog: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios/compare/v4.1.0...v4.2.0
Version 4.1.0 (Jun 30, 2017)
    # What's new in 4.1.0
    * XEP-0363: HTTP Upload support for much faster and reliable media messaging. [1]
    * XEP-0352: Client State Indication. Helps reduce network usage when running in the background.
    * End-to-end encryption for file transfers in OMEMO or OTR sessions [2].
    * Inline media previews for incoming URLs. (Optional)
    * Bug fixes and refactoring.
    * Tor 0.3.0.9

    # Caveats
    * Your server administrator must enable support for XEP-0363. See mod_http_upload for Prosody [3] and ejabberd [4] for more details.
    * Encrypted file transfer is required in OMEMO/OTR, but has limited compatibility for receiving clients. Users on the other end will receive `aesgcm://` links [2].
    * Inline media previews are enabled by default, but can be disabled on a per-account basis. This feature should be disabled if you have extreme privacy concerns or do not trust your contacts. This setting is always disabled for Tor accounts.

    Changelog: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios/compare/v4.0.9...v4.1.0
Version 4.0.9 (May 20, 2017)
    What's new in v4.0.9:
    * **NEW**: Now you can support continued development via in-app purchase. Help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable!
    * Partial fix for bug where keyboard covers chat area

    What's new in v4.0.8:

    * DuckDuckGo is shutting down their server in early May! If your account ends in `@dukgo.com` you need to migrate to a new server ASAP!
    * **NEW**: Account migration tool. Automatically create new account, move existing contacts, archive old conversations, and optionally notify old contacts of new account info.
    * **NEW**: Inbox / Archive. In addition to swipe-to-delete, there is now swipe-to-archive, which allows decluttering the inbox without deleting conversation history.
    * Fix a nasty bug introduced in 4.0.7 that could prevent OMEMO sessions from working. If your outgoing OMEMO messages were no longer getting delivery receipts, send some messages back and forth and it should fix the issue. When you receive an undecipherable message it will clear the session, which allows the session to be re-initiated on your next outgoing message.
    * Improve discoverability of group chat by replacing icon with "Group Chat"
    * Join existing group chats
    * Show icons to indicate media in conversation list message preview, and show warning if message had an error.
    * Disable deadlock detector because it was causing crashes on slower devices
    * Now available in France!

    What's new in v4.0.7:

    * Fix issue receiving short OMEMO messages from users of the Conversations app
    * Partially fix issue where invalid OMEMO bundles are published
    * Deadlock detector: If the app is frozen, please wait ~20 seconds for it to crash, then relaunch and submit a crash report.
    * Remove Dukgo from server list because their server will be shutting down soon. See https://twitter.com/cfarivar/status/852193164207063040
    * Add additional public community servers to list. Full list here: https://github.com/ChatSecure/xmpp-server-list
    * home.zom.im is now the default server for new account registrations
    * Adding/removing contacts while temporarily disconnected is more reliable
    * Update Catalan translation

    What's new in v4.0.6:

    * Fix crash affecting iOS 8 & 9 devices

    What's new in v4.0.5:

    * Shows notifications for incoming requests and outgoing approvals
    * Displays idle status / last activity in the title bar, for instance "Active 10 min ago". This keeps track of the last time you interact with the app, and will report this value when queried by your contacts. The time you last interacted with the app is identical for all of your accounts, so broadcasting this value is disabled for Tor accounts and when auto-login disabled.
    * Fixes a crash when viewing your account details on iOS 8 devices
    * Fix issues with contacts that get stuck as "Pending Approval"

Version 3.2.3 (Jul 25, 2016)
    v3.2.3 changes:
    * XMPP push for supported servers (XEP-0357)
    * Improved subscription requests UI
    * Basic vCard nickname support
    * Fix issues with missing messages during stale OTR sessions
    * Improved IPv6 support for NAT64/DNS64
    * Fix some issues with presence/availability
    * Added button to view your password
    * Fix issue where message view would appear multiple times
    * Automatically start OTR sessions when contact is online
    * Send error messages back to contact when messages cannot be decrypted
Version 3.2.2 (Apr 29, 2016)
    * Fix crashes and UI issues caused by asynchronous database initialization
    * Improved contact search when starting a new conversation (also now with less crashes)
    * Fix crash when sharing account on iPad
    * Update Italian translation
    * Fix multiple Knocks and improve reliability
    * Don't send delivery receipts if decryption fails
    * Update 3rd party dependencies
Version 3.2.1 (Apr 22, 2016)
    * Fix bug causing 73% of all crashes
    * Fix issues with Google Talk logins
    * Fix other crashes and bugs
    * Faster startup times
    * Slightly improved UI on iPad
Version 3.2 (Apr 14, 2016)
    New in v3.2:

    * Push: You can now briefly wake up offline ChatSecure iOS contacts via the "Knock" button. The Knock button will replace the Send button when no text is entered, you've previously established an OTR session with a Push-compatible contact, and the contact is offline.

    We would appreciate feedback on the UX of this design, which we know acts very differently from centralized messaging apps. There are plans to improve this experience when connected to servers supporting XEP-0357, which will allow any contact to wake your client.

    * Group Chat: You can now start and join group chats. End-to-end encryption is planned but not yet supported.

    * Onboarding: When starting the app for the first time, or adding a new account, there is a new onboarding flow to help simplify setup for new users.

    * Under the hood: Many changes that should improve performance and reliability.

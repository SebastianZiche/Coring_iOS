App Promotional Text
Tarsier is a brand new app focused on secure chats for protecting your privacy.
It generates user ID locally, save the private key in your device only, not anywhere else.
App Description
Imagine a world where you can message anyone without being forced to install the same app,
Imagine a world where you can host your own communication and still be part of a huge network.
This will be brought to you by Tarsier Secure Chat, which is powered by DIM.

DIM - an open source project that provides the protocol and system architecture.
which is designed for the next generation Internet that is coming.
DIM network could serve as a social network, in which users can send messages or digital assets freely.
Besides that, DIM can serve the Internet of Things as well. Allowing software to communicate autonomously.

Although other platforms are owned and operated by a single corporation, who has full control over everything,
DIM network is decentralized, and there is no one server, company, or person running it.
Anyone can join and run their own services on DIM network.

But, how does this work?

When someone joins DIM network with their servers, they are called Service Providers.
Since DIM network is open, a Service Provider can have its own set of services, while complying with DIM Protocol.
User identification is generated and verified using a cryptographically algorithm,
and no longer authenticated by a single corporation.
Because of this, Service Providers cannot monetize the user’s privacy or data,
they must compete by providing better services, and a better ecosystem.

This means that all the Service Providers share the same potential user base.
And users could choose the Service Provider that fits their needs at anytime.

Nowadays, the internet users place greater emphasis on protecting their privacy,
many people are concerned that their private information may be illegally used.
I hope this app can build a more safety social network to allow who don't want to provide too much information to the man-in-the-middle,
can still keep in touch with their friends freely.

Hope this application can bring you more convenience. Enjoy it!

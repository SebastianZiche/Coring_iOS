App Description
With AnyTalk you can stay in touch with anyone, anytime and anywhere! Freely. You can call or send messages, send photo and video messages as well as voice messages, locations and contacts worldwide over WiFi or 3G. AnyTalk seamlessly syncs across your devices and can be used on phones and tablets.

CALLS AND VIDEO CALLS
You can now call any of your AnyTalk contacts for free, arrange group calls (for up to 4 people), including video calls, while being sure that all your data is secured with encryption. (iOS 8.1+)

SYNCHRONIZATION AND PRIVACY
AnyTalk is taking care about your convenience and privacy, so we sync chats history across your devices, but don’t store it on our servers. Your chats history is yours and no one else can read it.

USE DIFFERENT SIM CARDS
AnyTalk give you ability to tie different phone numbers for the same account. This way you can insure yourself from losing access to the account when you lost sim-card, as well as freely use AnyTalk while you travel around the globe and use different sim cards.

ENCRYPTION
You can enable end-to-end encryption for both new or existing chats. When encryption is enabled, all outgoing messages will be encrypted by special key and only participants who got this key can read conversation. The key generates on device of user who initiate encryption and must be transferred to other chat participant by meeting in person. This way our servers knows nothing about your encryption key, plus you will avoid any possibility of man-in-the-middle attack.

HIDDEN CHATS
Encrypted chats will help you when it comes to data transfer and secure communication. But if someone get physical access to your mobile device — let’s say your friend, or mother, or girlfriend — we've got you covered with hidden chats! Such chats protected by password you will set and hidden from both chat and contact lists.
Hidden chats is a private feature just for your usage, so no one knows that chat is hidden on your device — even your participant.

Hidden chats available on phones only, tablets are not supported.

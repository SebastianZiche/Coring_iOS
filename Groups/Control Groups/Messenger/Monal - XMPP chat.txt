Monal - XMPP chat
Open source XMPP Messenger
Social Networking (Applications)

App Description
There has never been a better time to get into XMPP, a free public chat network no one controls or owns. Monal is a fast and user friendly way to use XMPP. Just download the app, login or register and you are ready to chat in minutes. It looks and works the way other apps do, so there is no need to “learn XMPP” or even care what it is.

Notable features:
- Open Source
- No Ads! Strong focus on privacy. Does not phone home and does not have "metrics" software 
- Does not read any personal information.
- With a direct connection to your server, your password and all other info is never sent to a third party.
- OMEMO encrypted chat
- Will work with corporate XMPP servers that require VPN
- MUC multi user chat

Implements XMPP certain extensions intended to improve mobile communication.
- XEP-0357: Push Notifications
- XEP-0280: Message Carbons keep messages in synch between clients.
- XEP-0198: Stream Management to quickly reconnect.
- XEP-0199: XMPP Ping to maintain connections.
- XEP-0313: Message Archive Management to download chat history.
- XEP-0352: Client State Indication for dramatic reduction on power use.
- XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload to send images in conversations.

    ---
    Version 3. This is the third major version release since 2008. There are major changes to the way the app works and looks. I hope that the changes that I have made are for the better. There will likely be some quick updates after this to address issues that are raised.
    Fundamentally, the way Monal works has changed. It will now use push to receive messages if that is an option. This vastly improves message reliability. Your servers will need to have a push support enabled. Monal's server still does not receive your messages, it will only know to wake up your device when there is a new message. If push is not available, multi-tasking will be short. This addresses changes to iOS in recent versions.
    Additional improvements:
    - A new layout for the UI, trying to highlight elements that are used more
    - iPhone X support
    - Conversation synchronization
    - Delivery Confirmation
    - Improved Multi user chat

App Description
Vidogram is the most unique and innovative Telegram Unofficial client which has more than 5 million downloads. And now after 2 years of waiting, we finally lunched the iOS version of Vidogram.

Advanced Forward: Have you ever wanted to forward a message to someone but you didn’t want to mention the source of it, or the message had some links and you wanted them removed, or even you wanted to send the message to several people at once? With Advanced Forward you can do all the said above at the same time.

Tabs & Tab Designer: If you have too many channels, groups, bots & contacts, then definitely you always have a hard time reaching the one you need. Now with tabs you can manage your chats by their type and if you think it is not enough, you can also design your favorite tab from its name and icon to the chats that it’s going to manage for you.

Confirmations: Sending an unwanted sticker, gif or voice message by mistake, definitely at least once have happened to you, but that could be prevented if there was something like a confirmation stuff before sending such things. Don’t worry, we have this security option too.

Now is the time to click the Download button and experience what you have been reading all along.

App Description
WatchMessage allows you to connect to Messenger on your Apple Watch!

With WatchMessage installed on your Apple Watch you can log into your Messenger to:
- see your most recent chats
- enter each chat
- see text messages
- view photos and videos
- listen to voice messages
- send voice messages

--- WatchMessage is the only app of its kind with full voice messaging support! (Sending + Receiving) ---

Composing responses can be done via:
- Keyboard
- Emoji
- Scribble
- Dictation
- and, of course, as an audio message with your actual voice!


All you have to do is linking your Facebook account through the official Facebook website and your messages will appear on your Watch!

What about your personal data?
WatchMessage does NOT breach your privacy in any way. All data is being handled safely: Because all operations are being handled by your iPhone there is no need of a potentially insecure third-party server. All your data stays on your devices.

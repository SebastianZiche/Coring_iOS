App Description

LYK is revolutionizing the social media space with its unique and never seen before privacy filters. LYK is one of the first social networks to give its users complete control over their online privacy – be it posts, comments or connection. Unlike other social networking platforms, LYK offers a safe environment for users to connect with each other, express themselves, and share or comment and bond with like-minded users while maintaining complete privacy.

LYK uses proprietary technology that includes machine learning & artificial intelligence to match users to others who share similar interests and passions. It is the only social network to offer three unique levels of connection, allowing users to easily separate posts, calls, and chats based on the type of conversation and content they want to share at any given moment.

Social Platform that pays you to be part of it:
LYK Reward Program ‘LYK Coins’ : LYK Coin is a never expiring reward program which users can choose to opt for and accumulate rewards based on performing different activities on LYK. Get value for your time through LYK Coins!


LYK’s unique privacy filters include:

● 3 Layers of Connections: Connect with others as Family, Close, or LYKMinded
● Invisible connection: When a user connects with another user as Close or LYKMinded, Lyk gives you the option to make that connection invisible in your network.
● Comment Privately – You can choose to comment privately on public posts as well as on
group chats.
● Posts for selected audience - Share posts that are visible only with an audience selected by you.
● Disappearing messages - Send disappearing messages in a personal chat and leave no trace behind. Once that message is read the intended user will not be able to see that message again when they return to the chat screen.
● Invisible Comments : You can select your audience to comment on a Post or Group chat making it visible to only select connections and invisible to others.
● 5 Patents – Perhaps the only social network platform to hold 5 Patents for privacy filters.





Other features:

- Connect with like-minded users with common mutual interests from anywhere in the world.
- Choose audience for public posts or share. Publish or Share posts on LYK World, only for your network, or for a single connection.
- Ability for users to chat in private or via group chats between each other.
- Create unique and meaningful connections using filters as Close, Family & LYKMinded
- Plan your next event or party and invite only the people you want to.
- Make free Video and Audio calls
- Enjoy LYK Live, creating your Live Video.
- Create Business Pages for individuals or companies.

LYK, a social network with focus on privacy that values you for your time, is one of the fastest growing social networks today globally with more than five hundred thousand verified users.

App Description
Send and receive high-fidelity messages, participate in HD voice/video calls, and explore a growing set of new features that help you stay connected. Link’s advanced privacy-preserving technology is always enabled, so you can focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to you.


• Say anything – State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption keeps your conversations secure. Privacy isn’t an optional mode — it’s just the way that Link works. Every message, every call, every time.


• Go fast – Messages are delivered quickly and reliably, even on slow networks. Link is optimized to operate in the most constrained environment possible.


• Feel free – Link is a completely independent 501c3 nonprofit. Development is supported by users like you. No advertisements. No trackers. No kidding.


• Be yourself – You can use your existing phone number and address book to securely communicate with your friends.


• Speak up – Whether they live across town or across the ocean, Link’s enhanced audio and video quality will make your friends and family feel closer.


• Whisper in the shadows – Switch to the dark theme if you refuse to see the light.


• Picture this – Use the built-in image editing features to sketch, crop, and flip your outgoing photos. There’s even a text tool so that you can add more words to the 1,000 that your picture is already worth.

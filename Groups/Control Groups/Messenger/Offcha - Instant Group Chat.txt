- Replacing (troublesome) e-mails
- Create a chat room temporarily to kill time

[How to use]
1. Create your chat room.

3. Let's talk with friends!!

* This service is not a dating / matching service. SNS (Twitter, KakaoTalk, Kik etc.) account information exchanges between unknown men and women are prohibited.

    HIDDEN MEDIA, ZERO STORAGE USAGE, NEW DRAWING TOOLS, PROFILE PICTURES FOR YOUR CONTACTS, AND PUPPIES

    We found someone's letter to Santa and implemented everything on the list:

    Hidden Media


    • Media with spoiler effects. You can wrap photos and videos you send in a fuzzy cover by selecting media in the attachment menu and tapping (⋯) > Hide With Spoiler.

    Zero Storage Usage


    • Auto-remove cached media. You can choose how long cached media is kept in Private Chats, Groups, and Channels – and add exceptions for specific chats.


    • Removing media by type. Separate tabs with Media, Files, and Music from all chats let you quickly clear the largest files.


    • Pie charts. The new design helps you see what's taking up space.


    • Dwarves with calculators. Cache size is now calculated a lot faster.


    • Reminder: All cached media you remove remains accessible in the cloud and can be re-downloaded if needed.

    Profile Pictures for Your Contacts


    • Setting pictures for your contacts. You can choose your own picture for a contact – only you will see it on their profile.


    • Suggested profile pictures. When editing your contacts, you can suggest a photo for their profile. It will take them just two taps to add the picture you suggested.


    • Public profile pictures. If you only allow certain users to see your profile photos, you can set a public picture for everyone else.


    • Ultimate profile picture privacy. You can set 'Who can see my profile photos' to 'Nobody' and add some users or groups as exceptions.

    Hiding Members in Large Groups


    • Member list privacy. Owners of large groups can hide the list of members.

    The letter also mentioned taking over the world and a puppy, but we hope the real Santa will be able to handle that – now that we've done the rest.

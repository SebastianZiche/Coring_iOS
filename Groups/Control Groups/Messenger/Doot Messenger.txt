Online activities performed on the Dooth Platform are private, encrypted, and secure. With Dooth: No tracking. No snooping. No profiling. No prying eyes.

Dooth is based on the concept of a ‘messenger’- a historical and oriental profession in India that existed in the medieval days to send and receive messages amongst the royals and the elites.
The job of a messenger, or a Dooth, was to deliver a message without compromising its security, let alone read its contents.

The Dooth’s sole responsibility was to convey the message or perish in the effort. This method ensured that there were no security breaches or invasions of privacy.

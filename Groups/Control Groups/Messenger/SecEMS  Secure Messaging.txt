App Description
“I’ve been using SecEMS for a couple of months now. Finally, a secure SMS and messaging app that works as it should, and even looks better than other Messenger apps. This is the way all messenger apps should work, safely encrypting voice & text messages and not storing our personal details.” - Gannett Clarke

Privacy is possible,SecEMS is private communication platform to everyone.
Help you chat with friends around the world.

SecEMS is the most secure instant messaging app that features end-to-end encryption, so your messages can only be read by the intended recipients, with no data logged on SecEMS’s servers.
Using SecEMS, you can communicate instantly while avoiding SMS fees, create groups so that you can chat in real time with all your friends at once, and share media all types of disappearing content with complete privacy — messages, photos, videos, and even files.It’s secure, superfast, simple, fast, free and synced across all your devices.SecEMS is not only a safe chat, but also an encrypted messenger.
###Features###
SECURE: SecEMS offers Secret Chats. The messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, audios, videos and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

PRIVACY: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data. SecEMS has security features that keep your privacy with password authentication and data encryption. It is the best place to hide your personal photos, videos and documents.

Private Cloud: SecEMS seamlessly syncs across all your devices, so you can always securely access your data. Safe and efficient private cloud, allowing you to access your information anytime, anywhere.

GROUP CHAT & SHARING: With SecEMS, you can form large group chats and broadcast lists of up to 100 members, quickly share large audios, videos, documents (.doc, .ppt, .zip, etc.), and send an unlimited amount of photos to your friends.

FAST: SecEMS is the fastest messaging app on the market because it uses a distributed infrastructure with data centers positioned around the globe to connect users to the closest possible server.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, SecEMS is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.

App Description
Safi helps protect you and your team against blackmail, smishing, phishing, spoofing, and ransomware attacks.

TEAM MEETINGS
You can join or share a meeting link with other members or non-users of the app, and they can even participate from their personal computers without the need for any installations. For security reasons, all meeting links are protected with a randomly generated password by default.

NO PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL REQUIRED
You only create a unique userID that can be changed at any time. When changed, the old userID becomes void and cannot be reused by anyone.

UPGRADAGLE 30 GB FREE STORAGE
Enjoy 30GB of storage for contents shared in team mode. Files remain encrypted on our servers indefinitely until you delete them.

STEALTH MODE
Messages sent in stealth mode are encrypted, self-destruct locally and from the server once read and cannot be recovered.

TEAM MODE
The team mode option allows users to securely collaborate in 1-on-1 or Group conversations and comes with powerful access control functionalities. There is no limit to the number of people that can be added to a group.

SCREENSHOT AND SCREEN RECORDING PREVENTION
On iOS, you get notified if a message recipient takes a screenshot or starts recording your message screen or calls.

SELECTIVE BLOCKING
Should you wish to no longer receive a certain file type (voice message, images, documents, etc...) from a contact, you can simply choose to apply a partial block.

WEB CHAT
Safi Stealth Messenger can also be accessed on the web at www.safi.chat, making it convenient to use on laptops and desktop computers.

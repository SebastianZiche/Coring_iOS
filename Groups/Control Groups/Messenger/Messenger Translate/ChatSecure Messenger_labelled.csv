The Knock button will replace the Send button when no text is entered you ve previously established an OTR session with a Push compatible contact and the contact is offline. We would appreciate feedback on the UX of this design which we know acts very differently from centralized messaging apps. There are plans to improve this experience when connected to servers supporting XEP 0357 which will allow any contact to wake your client. Group Chat: You can now start and join group chats. End to end encryption is planned but not yet supported. Onboarding: When starting the app for the first time or adding a new account there is a new onboarding flow to help simplify setup for new users.

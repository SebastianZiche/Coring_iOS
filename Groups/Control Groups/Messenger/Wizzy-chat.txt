App Description
Chatting acquiescence!
Do you and your partner have one?
Do you want to see the other keyboard typed out the wrong word when the little panic?
No history, privacy and security, as if chatting face to face!
Super thoughtful new way to play, you must not have seen oh!
If you don't know if you can impress the person you're talking to, you can clear it with one click!

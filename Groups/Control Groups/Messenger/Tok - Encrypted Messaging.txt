App Description
What is Tok?
Tok is easy-to-use software that adopts peer-to-peer communication, end-to-end encryption technologies. With Tok, you can send messages, photos, videos and files of any type without anyone else listening in. Tok's goal is to connect the world freely!

Why use Tok:
• Do not required phone number: Automatically generate random super-long ID, does not associate any real-name information.
• Invisible IP: Hidden IP address by onion routing, unable to track your location.
• Peer-to-Peer encrypted message: Automatically generates super-long key.
• Without any central server: No third party can listen in your conversation information.
• Text, picture and voice messages support
• Chat in group with your friends

    * New Design - In this version we updated the entire app including our logo, icon and design. We hope you love it as much as we do!

    * Profile – Now you can attach up to 4 profile images that you can share while talking to someone. During a conversation you can change your profile pic and it will instantly change to the other user.

    * Celebrity - There are many new Celebrity’s that have joined. In addition to being able to talk to your favorite Celebrities you can also follow their Parlor Message Boards and get pictures and updates that you can’t see anywhere else.

    * Friends, Favorites - Now you can easily add friends right from the conversation screen or from your history. You can also tag your friends as Favorites so that your best friends are easy to find.

    * History - Now you can see everyone that you have spoken to. We only display conversations that lasted over 10 seconds because if it was less then chances are it wasn't that great.

    * Messaging - It works for everyone. No more bugs or errors. simply click on a user from your History or Favorites and select Message. It's that easy. Our in-app messaging also is great for emoji's and sharing pics.

    * Direct Calling - We know how frustrating it was to meet your new best friend but weren't able to easily call them back from the app. You must be a Favorite of the person you are calling for your call to go through. You never know what the other person might be in the middle of so even though you are one of their Favorites it might be best to send them a quick message to see if they are free to talk.

    * Block/Delete/Report Users - There's always going to be a few users that just don't know how to behave. Please be vigilant and report them correctly right away. the faster you report them the quicker we can ban them. You are also able to delete and block users from both History and Favorites.

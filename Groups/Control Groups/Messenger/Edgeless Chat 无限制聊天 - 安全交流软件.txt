App Description
Edgeless Chat: Where walls don’t have ears

OVERVIEW

EDGELESS is the safest place to text. We believe your data should only belong to YOU, and there should be no prying eyes taking control of what you share online. Online lives are also real lives—which is why we must free ourselves from data mining, hacking, and relying on social media companies to safeguard our privacy. There should be no greedy company, government organization, or any third-party keeping tabs on you.

BLOCKCHAIN MESSENGER

Whether it’s everyday texting, exchanging photos with friends, or exchanging private information such as bank information, credit cards, passwords, social security numbers – EDGELESS has been designed to use the revolutionary blockchain technology to get your message across. Our systems ensure that your data goes through directly to the intended recipient with no prying eyes in the way.

Using this messaging app, you get the ability to:

1) Delete messages – both on your phone and THEIR phone
2) Use a built-in social networking “Memories” feature
3) Share files and documents of any sizes
4) Automatically erase your history using the “Burn” feature
5) Use Dark Theme and also customize your interface in different colors & themes
6) Utilize our blockchain technology to remain worry-free
7) And much, much more

EDGELESS user activity is heavily-encrypted. Even we can’t access it, let alone government organizations or marketing companies. When you delete your data using the Burn feature, there will be no backups – anywhere – and the data will get destroyed completely.

Using the same technology that makes Edgeless Chat great, we are striving to free today’s user from data abuse. Our mission is to change the internet and ensure that everyone is able to use it the way it was originally intended – we built Edgeless Chat with the same ambition in mind.

TAKE CONTROL

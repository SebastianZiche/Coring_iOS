Now some more words are banned. Certain words are banned in order to make a pleasant Lysn environment. Applicable to: Community open chat rooms In addition to general prohibited words throughout Lysn there are separate banned words for each community and open chat room. The administrator and sub administrator can set and manage banned words in their community or open chat room. 2. You can now see the announcement board with more ease. You can show the two most recent announcements on the home screen and see all posts that were previously put up as announcements in one place. 3. You can also change the calendar view in the community. The update allows you to change the calendar from a list view to a monthly view. Choose the mode you prefer and never miss out on important events!,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

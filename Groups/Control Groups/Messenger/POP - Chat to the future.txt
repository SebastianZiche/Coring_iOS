App Description
• POP is a pure instant messaging - simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices.

• Using POP Chat, you can communicate instantly while avoiding SMS fees, share media and other files with complete privacy, and create groups so that you can chat in real-time with all of your friends at once.

• You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the cloud for as long as you need it.

• You can make crystal-clear voice and video calls to people who live across town, or across the ocean, with no long-distance charges.

• You can create group chats for up to 100,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type, and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

• POP Chat is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees.

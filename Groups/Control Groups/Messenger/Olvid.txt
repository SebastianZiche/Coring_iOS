Olvid
Private messaging for everyone
Social Networking (Applications)
Free
App Description
Olvid is the first private instant messaging application for everyone.

What is a "private" messenger?

It's a messenger:

- That does not push new contacts on you. You are in control: you choose who you want to discuss with. Olvid offers several ways to invite other Olvid users, either face-to-face or remotely.

- That does not require any personal data. Olvid won't ask for your phone number, for your email. Unlike your previous messenger, Olvid will never request access to your address book.

- On which you will never receive unsolicited messages or messages from an unknown source.

- Where all exchanges benefit from the same security and privacy as a real-world discussion behind closed doors. Olvid offers end-to-end encryption and end-to-end authentication by default, always, for everything you send or receive.


Olvid guarantees you safe spaces, immune to external aggression, which isolate you from the digital noise and violence of other social networks. Create groups with your family, friends and key collaborators. No spam, no advertising. You finally regain full control over your communications.

Olvid has been designed to be the best place to exchange on subjects that matter, with those who matter to you.


Olvid - Technology
------------------

At the heart of Olvid, a 'cryptographic engine' coming from several years of research allows to mathematically prove the authenticity, the integrity, and the confidentiality of your communications.

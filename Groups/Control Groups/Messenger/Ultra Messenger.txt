App Description
Ultra Messenger: A P2P Marketplace for on-demand professional services.

Ultra Messenger offers direct messaging and calling with a diverse range of professionals worldwide: from doctors to dance instructors, lawyers to language tutors, architects to artists, and much much more. Simple, on-demand access to individual professionals, anytime you need them.

The app is free to download. Sellers on Ultra Messenger set a price for their time (per minute for calls, per message for texts) and you talk directly with them, paying only when you communicate with a seller.

How it works:

- Use usernames for privacy; no phone numbers shared, and all communications use a data connection avoiding SMS/MMS fees.
- Connect with voice/video calls and send texts, voice, photo, or video messages. Free for personal contacts, or at the listed price for monetized users.
- Ultra Messenger supports real-time translation of messages in 15 languages. Add users easily via usernames, QR codes, or social links.
- Pay only for what you use, no subscriptions or recurring billing, with clear upfront pricing.

For Sellers: Become a verified seller on Ultra Messenger if you're 18 or older and from a participating region. Set your price for messages and calls, with users paying as they connect with you. Enhance your reach with a personalized ultra.bio link and unique QR codes. Manage your availability with ease, receive direct deposits monthly in over 120 countries, and ensure every interaction is monetized, allowing you to concentrate on delivering high-value services on the platform.

Download the app and create an account to get started.

So we went ahead and removed them entirely. Now everyone is the same user type, and if you enable monetization, you get a blue check and see a few extra things on your normal account (like your earnings and top customers).

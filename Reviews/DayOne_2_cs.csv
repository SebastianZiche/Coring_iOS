It allows you to document your life to your heart's content with minimal effort. As far as functionality, my only complaint is that entries cannot be back-dated(so I can't easily transfer entries from my paper journals).

But, the bottom line is that without the security updates that Bloom Built keeps promising are coming, I simply cannot use this to it's potential. Journals can(and should) be not only the general happenings of the day, but also personal, private thoughts. I can't feel comfortable sending those un-encrypted to some company's server. As soon as they get to add those features, I can gladly and honestly give this app 5 stars. If you'd like a journal app and security does not concern you, this app is the best.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T02:59:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1533313199,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9484665?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9484665

2017-01-29T02:04:52,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.1.2,joshsharo,4,Some minor improvements would be welcome,"I got this app in anticipation of wanting to journal every day of the new year. The good news is, I have had no problem with the application's basic capabilities: the cloud backup, social media integration, and simple journaling tools make it quite easy to use.

The interface is also nice ‚Äì mostly, anyway. I think that viewing metadata (such as date, weather, and music), looks quite unpolished compared to the rest of the app. Not to mention that for me, the music information seems largely impractical, considering that there is no way to play the song from within the application itself (or if there is, at least, it is not easy to find). I also have a pretty big problem with the way that photos are handles within the entires: there is no text wrapping or precision resizing, making the entire process feel kind of clunky. Without these options, you'll have to be prepared to scroll quite a bit if you want to add a lot of pictures along with a lot of text.

I'd also point out a very annoying bug that I have found consistently plagues my journaling: contractions always appear as misspelled words. I don't have this problem outside of the app, and after saving the entry and going back to edit it, the red underlining disappears, but any new contractions I add are similarly misrepresented. (Note to the developers: this problem occurs on my 12.9"" iPad Pro using Apple's Smart Keyboard, but not on my iPhone 7 Plus.)

Perhaps what was most disappointing to me after using this app was the lack of statistical analysis concerning the entries. I'd love to be able to view average word counts and times of entries, along with nice graphs that show the same. I would also love some kind of word association chart to see which words are the most common. While these aren't necessities, I was expecting them to be included in such a relatively expensive journaling app.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T02:59:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1532596153,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9484658?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9484658

I'm also not a fan of the removal of the previous sync options. It just doesn't make sense to remove them. Why not at least give the option to the user? With all this in mind I thought I'd pay the fiver anyway and give it a go because I love the previous version but the app crashes every time I try to add a photo to my journal! That's literally the only reason I wanted to get the new version and it doesn't even work. Glad I didn't remove the old app. If only I could get a refund.

Update is broken. Prevents the app from opening do to lag. 

If you are considering paying for this app never update at the initial update wait for the 2nd update where they fix all the bugs created in the previous release. 

Spotty development at best. 

***Updated
The latest update fixed the posting issue using a url scheme. I am back to a happy journaler. 

With functionality of IFTTT, Workflow, and Launcher Pro this is the easiest and best jouenaling tool out there. 

**old

If you have the classic day one app to not update. 

Day One 2 has only accomplished breaking any functionality that was working. 

The only feature added that appears to work is the ability to put more than one picture in a post. 

However in classic you could accomplish this same feature by using markdown and linking to the picture. 

In classic you are able to use Launch Center Pro to create writing prompts. You could also use Workflow to create entries regarding books, movies, etc. All that is broke with Day One2.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T02:59:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1524497084,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9484765?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9484765

If you still think that journaling is pointless, or incompatible with the busyness of everyday life, this app might help you change your mind. The interface provides a calm and inspiring environment to write about your thoughts and experiences without distractions or constraints. Its functionality is simple and sophisticated at the same time; you'll write in your journal in the same way as you would post entries in a blog (you can also add pictures). If you want to classify your posts into different themes or areas you can run up to 10 journals (you can also add tags to your posts, which makes it easier to go back to older entries and see e.g. how your views about a certain topic have changed).",,,,,,,,,2022-05-05T12:54:45,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1521776392,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/79733169?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=79733169

I like the password feature, finger print password on my iPad Pro. I encrypt my entries by writing in Portuguese! However, it works great in English too.

I can easily add photos. The journal records where and when and even the weather for the day I journal. 
Yes, yes. You could use a note taking app to journal, but trust me, it doens't have that journal feel. Let's face it, if you're going to reap the benefits of journaling, you might as well enjoy it.
Note taking apps are overkill with too many features. And like I said, note taking apps don't have that 'open a journal and just write' sort of feeling. 
The iOS app works well between devices and the desktop version works equally as smooth. Syncing  is a breeze. 
The desktop version was a bit steep, but I'm still happy to support the developer for a well-made product. I like that I can keep multiple journals, too. One for personal, one for household things and communications. 
If in doubt, give the desktop trial version a try. I think you'll like it.

However, the text entry and word processing functions are a ridiculous throwback to green screen days.  You need to use text symbols to mark words for bold or italic, make a bulleted list, etc.  Your input/edit screen shows these symbols without application and you need to finish to see how the text will really look.  Come on!  Is this 1975?

Put a word processing capability that works like Word or Pages into this product and it would be 5 star.",,,,,,,,,2022-10-29T21:20:24,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1502886674,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/135307412?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=135307412

Another nice feature is the ""on this day"" notification. Surprising how much I forget. It's also a big spur to get me to actually make (meaningful) entries on a daily basis!

It's been a wonderful and transformative experience.  The interface is not only clean and intuitive, but everything just flat works (including the sync) in a very snappy way.  This inspires me to use it at the end of every work day and I've since developed the positive habit of project journaling.  This allows me to pick up every morning exactly where I left off the night before, eliminating the considerable warm up time that I used to spend every morning after arriving at my desk.  

Because I work with data and programming languages, my one big wish for the app is that it improves tables support and offers the opportunity to insert code blocks in native formats (like, for example, R or Stata).  

In short, I could not be more enthusiastic about the app.  Kudos and thank you to the developers for creating something so versatile, so solid and so enjoyable to work with.

I really like all of the changes in version 2.0. Multiple journals for separating different types of entries is particularly nice.

Aesthetically it's much more pleasing than it's competitors and it's a very fluid app. Usually runs great. Does have a bug where if you're typing a lot sometimes it slows the app down; kill and restart fixes but still annoying. These two things would make it 5 stars for me. 

1. Sync across devices. I've had so much pain with them on this. Seriously had to do a profile fix like 3 times and I'm not sure what that even does. Must refresh an API plugin for their server or something.  It's an atrocious implementation though. They need to use iCloud or Dropbox or google drive or anything else really. If they can get it fixed then great but iCloud just seems so much more straight forward and easier since it's pretty much baked in for use. 
2. Features. Would be great for more editing tools like annotation on a picture or lists and things. It doesn't recognize when I'm trying to number things and that's annoying. 

Overall, Great app and it's my go-to for journaling. Love it.

2016-10-26T23:31:11,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.1.1,Cool Hand Pete,3,I love it EXCEPT the keyboard lags,"Running on an iPhone 5S or an iPad Mini 1 (I know, I'm behind the times) the in-app keyboard lags, making typing frustrating. I make many more typos in it than I do in the Notes app because of this. The first word typed is particularly troublesome, as the app tends to recognize the first and maybe second letters, then struggles to keep up and it mis-autocorrects the first word as a result.

I changed the body font to Georgia, so perhaps this is the reason...?

Second, the app should automatically go into edit mode when I click on any text I've written, rather than require me to click the Edit button. This is my journal, after all! Trust me - if I didn't want my text changed, I wouldn't have tapped on it!

The slow typing problem notwithstanding, I love this app very much. I love how it integrates time stamps, weather, temperature, step count, and location along with customizable tags. I use tags to track stress headaches for my doctor, as well as coffee intake to see whether the two are related.

Typically, I take a photo while I make an entry, simply because I like that each entry has a photo beside it - even if it is unrelated for the most part.

I now have upgraded Day One on all my devices, including my Mac, and the syncing is seamless.

Great work - just fix the keyboard issue please.

Update 10/27/16

The new ""journal entry"" feature adds unnecessary complexity. I would prefer the ""quick-entry"" ability so when I click the plus icon, I can type.

The lag upon opening is still there.

They do not allow you to backuyp to dropbox or iCloud claiming users have had issues in previous versions. If that's true, it's the developers fault, not dropbox or apple.
Second, you have to pay for two different apps if you want to use on a mac and IOS devices.  When I asked why was told they are different platforms.  Rubbish, many other companies manage.

Which is a shame, because I really do like the app. A password to get into the app only prevents someone from accessing your journals when they are on YOUR device. It's like locking your front door but leaving your backdoor unlocked. All it does is provide the perception of security. Anyone with a little computer knowledge can access our most intimate thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Think about what you are putting in your journals and ask yourself if you want just anybody having that information. You can unknowingly be putting your children and loved ones in jeopardy. Without end-to-end encryption our journals are not private nor secure. I won't even use it for my shopping list. To me, encryption should have already been built in when this version was released.

I've tried quite a few journal apps and none had as many great features as this one has. The highlights for me, are the ability to edit the text to include bold and italics as well as a fair selection of fonts to choose from.  The ability to add photos to each entry inline is great. Exporting in pdf or plain text and being able to save to Dropbox is great. 

Sure there are more features I'd love to see added like the ability to colonize text or put a wallpaper on each individual page, but that's just nitpicking really.  

I've been an avid journaler for 30+ years and this is well worth the minimal price they charge to have ease of use and the ability to be expressive. I love it.  I look forward to future updates...

But the way this app stores your data, isn't safe.  They are stored as individual files. As text files and photos and they can be opened with any text editor.  

There is no privacy when it comes to the widgets. No matter if you put a password, you can see photos and other information on your phone's home screen without unlocking it. 

I don't like this proprietary syncing limit. 

Password for your journal is only 4 digits. Should be 6 or more.

Instead it has been a huge disappointment. In fact the only benefit of the new version over the old one is that you can post more than one picture to a day's entry. Unfortunately, everything else is a mess. It crashes every 2 minutes (when I scroll down looking for dates, the screen just goes white) so I have to exit out and then come back. Also, in the old version, when you put in an entry for a date in the past, when you saved the entry and went back to the journal, it would put you back in that year and date so you could see all the entries around your new entry. This made it really easy to find a date without going into the calendar, which is laborious. Now, you have to scroll, which takes a long time. I hate that. Wish they had left that feature and frankly I wish I had never upgraded. Never had these issues with the original app. If anyone knows how I can go back, pls tell me.

To my delight, GPS locations still worked! So I was able to easily mark the furthest north I've been along with my thoughts about it. It all worked great. Once I was back in the connected world everything sync'd back up.

Frankly I find the process of leaving reviews tedious and time-consuming. Today I opened up DayOne to write a journal entry, and I noticed that the interface had changed, and there was a new opportunity to add things from my social network. 

Curious (and wary) I decided to try it. Wow! I cannot believe it. 

To me, while this may not be a 'professional feature', is it if fantastic and welcome update for lazy or busy wannabe journalists. 

Of course there are always privacy concerns, and I will be looking carefully to see what protection I have, but since this is pulling data FROM my Facebook, FROM, my Instagram, and FROM, my Twitter feed,  and placing info into my personal diary, I worry a little less. In fact, to me, this is welcome as I was already trying with IFTTT and Zappier, some glue, spit and a Macguyver wire to do this anyway. 

 I also like the fact that it's holding onto information about where I've been, so that I can make notes later on. Yeah. I'm shocked too. Again privacy alarmist I understand. Normally I shut all that stuff down. For a diary? Well it's kind of useful.

The implementation of activity feeds fetched from popular social media sites is a great addition to an already feature rich app.

The search tool is more powerful. Now, when I search for a key word or phrase, I can also select the tags from entries in the search result to narrow down the result to include the words AND entries with the specified tags only.

The calendar view is now more easily navigable than ever. Before I have to scroll through all the interim dates to get to a specific past entry. Now, I can select a specify month, date, and year and jump right to it!

Con:

I liked being able to sync over the iCloud, not the day one cloud.
Separate app from the original, so I have 2 different apps between my computer and mobile devices. 

Overall a wonderful app, but still has some minor tweaks to make it back to the old app widget wise.

This app is more worn-in now and is a lot more reliable. Sure the sync is not always 100% but in general it is very good. The UX is maturing nicely and is enjoyable to use now. Some nerdy features like CLI and IFTTT are now implemented too. Encryption is on the way and I think this will bring in a few hold-outs. I don't know is if subscription is also on the way but as a customer I'm not in favour of that model. Honestly I don't know what the right solution is for developers but it's a trend I'm worried about, especially considering the number of apps I use. I usually upgrade to new versions whatever new features are there or not, but perhaps this is not enough for a viable business? Anyway DayOne is well worth the price of entry on all platforms. Best in class journaling app once again. 
-----------------
I've tried to like this app as I was very impressed with the first iteration.

Dayone 2 is quite buggy and if you don't want to be worried about sync issues and data loss it would be best to hold off. Support seems to be overwhelmed at the moment with requests. 

I bought it for Mac as well and that has problems too- it seems more like a beta version.

I searched for a program of some sort and became extremely frustrated because I always ran into brick walls of limitations. Last year I resorted to creating a pen & paper version where I could log in each area of my life, jotting down memories, important dates/events while keeping up with other tidbits big and small. 
Then I found Day One. It has so many bells and whistles I'm amazed and thankful! I love how I can make quick entries, add photos and links, and even have location and weather automatically included! What's even better is I can manually change the date going back in time or adding an event in the future. What's even better (Big deal right here) is I can export my my entire bundle of journals in pdf file format!!  How awesome!

Simple, elegant, easy to use, easy to find what I want to remember, it's the only one I use now.

A ""you have two journal entries from this day in history, relive your memories"" I considered it a nag alert & kept meaning to turn it off. But today, after I wrote something, I clicked the alert. And was taken back to 3 years ago, and apparently on that day I was, for some reason, waiting to hear from my partner. It was about how happy I was to get a text from him. What a fun reminder of my crush.

The second was a year later, a New York Times article I had saved about the guilt that comes from being in contact with families that abused you. It was really helpful, apparently again.  

I'm so happy, to be reminded by journaling of the rich spectrum that I am capable of feeling, highs and lows. It cuts the dominating strength of a current emotion to realize that the wheel will turn.

Thought it was great. I yearned for features and enhancements like multiple photos and other smaller ones like additional metadata to the entry. 

I stopped using it once I realized those features would never come. They did appear but only as a paid purchase of the new 2.0 version. Naturally, I was thrilled about that. I felt like we were being hung out to dry. Classic was being 'sunsetted' and all users were asked to move up or move on. 

I understand that certain major changes need a full reboot and a new pay structure. Then again they also doubled the price. I paid my money and I'm happy with the new version, new features and such but I'm leery that I'm going to be left out in the cold again. Sadly if it does happen I'm not sure what I will do. Maybe just keep using 2.0 and go about my business.

It is freggin amazing!!

Hands down it is the best journal app I have ever spent money on. I bought the mobile and Mac version of the app. In 300 days I have over 900 entries. I use this app a lot 

Things I like
-Touch ID
- reminders to write
-syncing between phone and Mac
- the user interface
- multiple journals
-tagging
-search feature
-location
- multiple pictures

Things I don't like/ would like to see
- price
- I want to add video to my entries
- Mac: I wish the formatting would appear as is instead of the stars, double stars (*, **)
- I can't email journal entries to myself.
- if I write in the wrong journal I want to be able to switch it quickly. 

Overall, this is really easy to use and a ton of work has been done under the hood since the previous version. If you had the last version ( ""day one classic"") of the app consider dropping the cash. You won't be disappointed.

Which is still not the case. I paid for the Mac OS version. I paid for both versions on iOS and unfortunately I guess I'm in the minority of people who own both a Windows and Mac computer and this app can't be used on Windows. 

Unfortunately for me I like my SP4 because it's much lighter and easier to carry and I was hoping that by now I could at least journal from it via the web. I don't expect a dedicated app. Just a site that was promised to us. We have been more than patient as fans and consumers.

I recommended this app (well the original) to lots of colleagues and family members. Never again. To promise a feature and then not deliver is the surest way to lose the word of mouth fan base. For what you currently are we can use Pages or Word which is cross compatible between all devices and online.(which I have to use when I'm on the road anyways)",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T02:59:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1432817751,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9485325?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9485325

I've always wanted to keep a good journal, but have never succeeded until that app came along. That being said, by the time you buy the Mac version and the iOS version, you've made quite the investment. Plus, I feel they didn't treat their initial customers (of which I was one) well by making them buy the updated version when the initial buy-in was so pricey to begin with-- hence the 4 stars. However, because the app works so well and I actually journal now, I've paid it. I may not pay again, however, if they do that to their customers in the future with a ""new version."" Or at least give the existing customers a discount (like $.99 or something rather than the full price)! All in all, a great product.

I can also insert photos I have taken each day in the appropriate place in the days journal.  I highly recommend it.

On past trips I have used a pen and paper journal, but have never kept up on a daily basis, and of course could not insert photos.  With Day One, I can insert any photo I take with my iPhone 6 ... Use AirDrop to transfer the photo to my iPad Pro and then insert easily.

I loved the first version. It was simple in style yet had a very nice style which makes it easy to use whilst making your entries easy to write, find and enjoy. I have both the Mac desktop app and the IOS and both complement one another wonderfully and I have never had syncing issues with either when using Dropbox or Day Ones new service. The 2.0 edition brings with it the ability to add multiple photos which is fantastic. The calendar view is a great feature allowing you to easily see when you have entries for and if you like to look back you can allow notifications that let you know when you have historic entries on the same day.

I used iCloud up until Day One Sync was introduced in version 1 of the app. I did have some issues with iCloud, but Day One Sync works great and syncs in the background, something iCloud doesn't do.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T02:59:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1426585929,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9485225?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9485225

I have been using this app for only six days. The first thing that strikes me is how many features it has. So I can see the potential. 
I would give this app five stars except I don't know how to stream line the writing screen. Right now while I'm writing half the screen is taken up by the calendar, and navigation features.

I haven't tried it yet but I really like having the option to export journals to PDF so I can make a hard copy if I need/want to. Locking my journal with the touchID is a very likable feature as well.

It has been an answer to logging my thoughts.  I write almost daily after I have read my scriptures and keep it in the same folder as my scriptures on my iPhone.

It helps me write my thoughts and feelings especially after scriptures that I have had a hard time doing.  Oh, I do have to say a huge Mahalo for including up to 10 pictures per entry.  One picture often doesn't do an experience justice.

25 Jul 16 Update:  I capture thoughts and pictures that make my journaling relevant.  I also found that I can have multiple journals as I start up focusing my finishing my dissertation.  Thank you again

This app looked great and was an ""editor's choice"", but I'm shocked at how unfinished and buggy it is. I'm on a newer iPad2. It should work fine with all the RAM and processing power I have.  Here's the list of issues and bugs I'm experiencing: 1.) The ""back button"" link when you're on a post (which is the name of your journal) works intermittently. Sometimes, when I'm finished writing a post it works. But other times it does nothing. I can't go back. The app sort of ""freezes"" for a second or two, is unresponsive, then does nothing.  2.) Scrolling doesn't work properly.  Sometimes it works smoothly, most times not.  It's jumpy, laggy and feels like the app is leaking memory. Gives the impression the app is on the verge of crashing and I'm going to lose my work.  Doesn't exactly inspire confidence.  3.) Words inexplicably break in the middle of sentences and I can't get them to re-join. I backspace, try to rejoin the word but the same thing keeps happening.  Ridiculous and frustrating.  4.) Copying and pasting text into a post is a nightmare, with jumbled words and illogical line breaks everywhere.  And, of course, breaks in the middle of words when there is plenty of room left on the line.  Just one letter in the middle of the page on the end of a line...then the rest of the word starting on the line below. And it can't be rejoined no matter what I do. Useless.

I've only been using this app for an hour. These issues are GLARINGLY OBVIOUS. It makes make me feel the developers rushed this version of DayOne out the door (""we gotta ship!"") rather than test the app properly and release something solid. It's not solid. It's not ready for Prime Time.  It isn't ready for release at all.  Is this why it was 50% off?  Listen: if your software isn't ready, don't release it into the wild and rely on your USERS to be your quality control.  ANY person on the DayOne team (don't they have testers?) could have and SHOULD HAVE caught these issues if they had used the app or tested it before releasing it. I'm shocked. With all the good reviews (from earlier versions), I was confident I made the right choice, but obviously I didn't.  For some reason, this version was rushed out the door.  DayOne chose to jeapordize their good name by releasing a shoddy, half-finished app, rather than properly testing - or even using! - this version before releasing it. Again, I've only used the app for an HOUR and I have already found half a dozen serious bugs. Gee, thanks for charging me $4.99 and wasting my time for the ""privilege"" of being your software tester, DayOne!  What a waste.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T02:59:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1418976264,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9485285?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9485285

Oh surprise. The app is slower than ever, almost six months since the update and I still can't switch apps while editing an entry without having to relaunch the app to the main screen, photos take an eternity to sync, the ""on this day"" feature that cannot be turned off and makes Day One feel like Facebook.

2016-07-20T18:20:55,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0.10,lionlight,4,Long haul journal that fits into my life,"I suppose I'd say I love Day One because I use it. Very intimately. I feel safe and free to communicate and express myself to it. How often can you say that about a journal? An app? Day One has been the simplest integration of the journal habit into my regular life. 

I REALLY like the geotagging. I appreciate some of the IFTTT integrations. 

Most of the important buttons are all in the right place. Touch ID locking is fabulous. Ability to craft a post on the fly without unlocking the journal is also a fantastic time saver. Shaving milliseconds from the points of idea creation to idea expression is important to me. I think a thousandmilesaminute. Ideas are fleeting. Time is important. DO thought of this. They should keep thinking of that. Improving upon that.  

What I don't like: 

DO2's lack of iCloud syncing. I'd like to sync to iCloud.

What I'd like to see improved: 

- Stick the hash button on the main keyboard. Instagram and Twitter position this convenience right next to a (smaller) ""return"" button. 

- Mild image editing would be much appreciated. I don't need a the 64 color crayon box of unnecessary filters, but a handy square/crop/reposition would be deeply appreciated. Even though I'm simply journaling for myself, sometimes the 3:4 orientation of my photos just fall flat. Weaving trails from various apps I think just deflates a little momentum, honesty, and intimacy I hold with DO. A little fleeting momentum adds to a lot of misplaced passion over time. 

- Shift day start option. Some other apps have this feature and I found it surprisingly useful! It would be helpful for night workers and others who keep non conventional hours. Sometimes, when I find myself awake after midnight, the post fits better with the cadence of the previous day, not the current. It would be helpful to optionally manipulate the timeline in those cases.

2016-07-19T00:56:15,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0.10,JCHoppe,4,Somehow very convenient,"I should have thought, and did, that this App (and desktop application) would be unnecessary, for one could always use Word or Evernote or some other text app. 
But after years of ambivalence I concluded that other options just weren't working and picked DayOne up again. And it is working for me. 
I have not had occasion to test whether it's possible to get entries out of it and over to another program, which I will do presently. If that doesn't work, that's a deal-breaker, and I'll have to get out of it and cut and paste the 10 days or so where I've made entries. 
I'm puzzled that the set of fonts in the app is so restricted, and for the most to odd fonts. For a diary, one would expect, if not access to all installed fonts, at least a robust selection of serif fonts. But no. I wrote customer service and they promptly replied that they would keep that it mind for future iterations.  Surprising.  Why not Calibri and a Garamond, if not Janson or Sabon or a Baskerville?
Licensing issues?  I would have thought Apple system fonts would be available.  Few people seem to know that nonserif fonts were not intended for text but designed for signage.  There is even a movie, called Helvetica, that speaks to the barbarity of that nonserif font. 
I'm not aware of any workarounds as with the Kindle.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1414974478,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486051?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486051

Have sent diagnostics to the developers. I purchased the upgrade at half price so I think that a fair price to pay for a bug or 2. For those complaining of paying again (for version 2), I don't think $4-$5 is too much to ask for both iPhone & iPad versions. Considering the amount of time it must take to develop these apps I think the price is very reasonable.

2016-06-28T12:56:55,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0.8,SilverenRose,5,PERFECT JOURNAL APP!!!,"I have been using this app for three years as my journal and I love it! If I'm sitting in a doctor's office waiting on an appointment to begin or if I'm anywhere really, and I have a thought, feeling, or observation that I want to write down, I no longer have to carry a notebook that is my journal or a pen and try to find a hard space to set my journal down on to write down whatever I wanted to write down while watching to see if anyone is looking over my shoulder to see what I'm writing(I am referring to my very inquisitive and sneaky children lol) or wondering if I can write fast enough before they call me into my appointment without getting a chance to finish my thought.

This app allows me to journal from my computer, from my iPad, and also from my phone. I love that I can journal from anywhere with this app! I absolutely love that I can add pictures to my journal entries since I also write poetry and am able to find a picture that somewhat, if not completely, captures and expresses my poem in a visual form and the same can be said for finding images and pictures and being able to load them into the same journal to help express thoughts that are not written as poetry but just as a regular journal entry.

My last absolutely favorite thing about this app is that you can back up your entries to the Day One server, ICloud, Dropbox(my personal favorite) or to a custom location of your choice. This ensures that even if your computer, iPad, iPod, or iPhone all crash and burn(not that all of them doing that at the same time seems likely) you don't have to worry that you just basically lost your journal period because the entries in DayOne, as long as they are backed up regularly, maybe a few times a week, you won't have lost any of your journal entries at all. 

All in all, I consider myself lucky the day I stumbled across this app and paid for it and then began using it regularly. I have had other journal apps but none of them even came close to this app. I definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for a journal app that can keep up with you!!",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1401804289,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9485473?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9485473

This one is absolutely an upgrade and worth the couple of bucks it costs. Let's be honest, journaling is hard! Especially in this day and age when people are constantly moving or can't be torn away from their smartphones. And who wants to write by hand anymore?! That takes time and energy that a few little taps of the thumbs could mitigate significantly. So we're left with a few options: A) never think about how you feel and are processing the events of your life B) tell everyone you've ever met on Facebook and Twitter or C) buy this app and start thinking more deeply about your life and how you're living it.

Maybe I stilted those options a little, but I'm just trying to make a point and help YOU, dear reader, understand that if you're even on this page (meaning you have some kind of interest in journaling) you should go ahead and buy this app.

You can even put things in italics and bold!!

There is no way to make TODO lists and not a lot of formatting options, but what I love about this app is the ability to share things as they happen and have different journals for different things. 

I share photos of memorable moments with DayOne and it files it under the location and date of the photo, and I add a short excerpt of my experience.

When I workout to an exercise video, I share the link to that video to my training journal. When I go on an outdoor training adventure, I take a pic, and share the pic with my training journal. 

I have a travel journal for sharing my trip pics.

I also like the ability to tag things, but not sure I will use this feature much when reviewing past notes.

It is critical to get all of this barrage of data, thoughts, feelings and concerns out of my head and processed through my conscience to a journal and then to my task management vehicles(Pocket Informant/OneNote) where action items are identified, prioritized and tracked.  The cross platform sync allows access anyplace/anytime.

They say, 'A picture tells a thousand words', and I love the way I'm able to capture a visual array of memory-joggers and apt snapshots that portray the essence of my story. I never need to fear that I'll spill water on my precious artifact or mislay it in the business of life. It is user-friendly and dummy-proof, yet sophisticated enough in its innumerable handy features to enhance my record-keeping with interesting information such as weather, location and more. When I scroll down through the visual display of my timeline, I have a sense of achievement which inspires me to keep on writing. I always recommend this app as my, 'best find'.

(I've only used up two notebooks in that time.) The inconsistency wasn't a lack of desire to journal, but rather a lack of time that I was willing to set aside to pull out the book and sit down and write at length. 

This app is the perfect solution. I can pull out my phone whenever I have a spare minute and make note of anything. I love the fact that it can contain a photo, and all of the little details like location and weather and even step count are just super neat. The ability to sync it with the computer version adds the ability to sit down and write at length if I want to, and the tags can separate out long ramblings of nonsense from small anecdotes and daily musings. 

I've only had the app for four days and I already have ten entries.

After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase the app to see for myself whether I was comfortable using their sync services as opposed to iCloud. After reading through the Terms of Service I decided against it.

The problem comes down to the question of data security. Is my data more likely to be safer with Apple iCloud or DayOne. Personally, I'm going with Apple.

The 'new, improved' 2.0 imported my old entries... then crashed whenever I tried to review more than two or three entries. I was very, very sad because there were some new features I really wanted to use. 
Fast forward a couple of months and 2.0 gets another chance....and delivers! My rating goes from one star to five stars and I get all the features I longed for. 
I particularly like the ""On this day..."" option - today just happens to be my son's 18th birthday and choosing this shows me his picture 'on this (special) day' over the last six years. (Huge 'ahhhh'!). It's nostalgia that I just couldn't get anywhere else - and I'm a sucker for nostalgia. 
Being able to add more than one picture to an entry is also a new feature I like. It was always tough choosing just one pic for an event - or otherwise having to make two or the entries just to be able to add the pics. His birthday this year will have loads of pics!!
I could go on but I'll stop - birthday duties call. I'll just say, for the money it's the best app I ever bought.",,,,,,,,,2022-05-23T20:10:19,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1391179509,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/90123556?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=90123556

I've been writing habitually now and I must say the multiple photo allowance is really nice, as well as multiple journals and a nice redesign. 
BUT.. While writing I notice an unbearable lag which makes typing very difficult as what you are typing lags behind what shows on the screen.
I also like Day One Classic's simplicity better, I feel like there is a bit too much clutter and photo entries on Classic were better oriented.

Pretty good app if it were free all the time but for $5+ (however much they're charging at the moment) it is not quite worth it, especially the Mac version which I believe is $15.

I haven't always rated it five stars; there have been times when it has seemed that the developers have been more interested in rushing out new features than in quality control. But things seem to have settled down, and the app is now pretty stable.

This is, in my opinion, for whatever that is worth, the best journal app, ever. There are good apps for planning the future, but sometimes what you really need is reliable information on the past, and that is where a journal is invaluable. The feature set and functionality in DayOne are unmatched. I highly recommend it.

The tinfoil-hat folks continue to rate this app one star. That is unfair to the app. The developers clearly state that using their sync service is mandatory for using the app on multiple platforms.

I also use it for miscellaneous notes that track various things, such as books I recently finished reading and ongoing weigh-ins on the bathroom scale! It is useful to be able to change the creation dates on these to current and thus return them to the top of the ""newest-first"" array.

I did not own the classic version so buying DayOne 2 was simply because of number of good reviews. The app is not cheap, especially its Mac version. If that price reduce to somewhere $15 I'll buy to keep companion with this app. 

Here are the things I like:
- simple, modern and well designed interface
- map view
- Touch ID integration
- check in, reminder
- text, photos, location...

And here are the things I dislike:
- not support iCloud or DropBox; so I end up write my diary locally on my iPhone only; I don't like to sync to somewhere else
- when typing journal entry, the app keep loading Internet or I'm not sure what it's doing but the loading icon next to telco name keep rotating, only when I turn cellular off, it stops

2016-06-01T14:55:14,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0.7,World Racer - F Squad,5,A journey worth remembering.,"I purchased Day One in January 2012. I was about to embark on an 11 month journey to 11 countries around the world. I wanted a way to categorize and document my travels. My intent was to become a better writer with this journal app. I used the app on my Mac back then, but much more on my phone today.

In the years since my first entry I realized that I've become a much better reader. It's important for me to remember the little moments in life, however wondrous or mundane they may be. The ability to look into a single interface to find that one quote or picture from that one moment of inspiration I had in Thailand, India, or my car back home.

I love the being able to take pictures and add them to the entry. And I love the way I can tag entries, it makes organizers like myself happy. This journal allowed to me to record seasons of life that I really needed to remember for those moments when battling against depression became much more difficult. I'm thankful to be able to look back and read the ways the lies in my head seeped in and affected my life. It gives me power today to walk in a way that leads me where I want to go, not where my emotions or feelings lead. Not to where negative tendencies and habits lead to old ruts in my present life. Looking through old Day One entries had become like a tool for me to move forward in passion and purpose. 

Day One Journal has been a gift to myself. There's no way for me to have known the impact it would have on me when I made the purchase in 2012.

Life is a journey worth remembering. Much like life where a new chapter can start any moment, Day One gives users the ability to write new chapters while also remember old ones in a simple, beautiful and categorical way. This app is wonderful and I've finally found a way to remember the valleys and the mountains of my own journey.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1387372068,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486022?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486022

Secondly the app will get stuck occasionally when i finish writing a journal entry. It just becomes unresponsive for don't know what reason. And the only way out is to quit the app from the multitasking and launch it again. This is something you don't want when you pay 5$ for an app.

I was extremely worried when the developer rolled out the new version because of the trend of all iOS apps moving towards subscription models (for now that doesn't seem the case, but it is still a future concern).   The extra logging features can give a lot of great insight, but I'm wary of using them until they put in a better encryption setup (which should be arriving with the 2.1 update down the road).  The different journals are a great feature that has opened this app up to a wide variety of uses, but at the end of the day I want a journaling app that I can trust with details of my life.  I really enjoy the ""on this day"" feature in the newest update, so it's clear the dev team is hard at work.

Some nice new features such as multiple journals, but it's not different enough to justify charging me again and it's crashed a few times in the first week.

I absolutely refuse to do this. I don't want my personal data stored on multiple servers around the world.

Sync: The occasional sync issues need to be fixed but they've never directly affected me. I almost always journal on my iPhone. 

Journaling: I've found keeping a daily journal helps me remain more mindful. I try to reflect on and reframe daily events in the most useful way which is good for keeping negative self talk at bay. On a practical level, as I have a number of medical conditions that I need to monitor, I've been able to use Day One to make notes on my physical state and track how medications are affecting me. This is useful to review just before seeing doctors or just for my own awareness. 

I know this seems crazy but I've also realised that journaling lets me avoid sharing thoughts on social media that are really just for me.

2016-05-25T03:03:17,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,ca,en,2.0.6,'K' Na√±ola,3,"Nice, But Pricey & Lacks Usability","Sure, Day One 2 is full of some neat new features. But none are groundbreaking enough to warrant a whole new app separate from the original.

I bought DO2, mainly for the multiple photo feature (again, something they could've done with the original). The multiple journal feature is pretty useful, too, though I wouldn't recommend buying it for that.

I find the app itself to be slow, clunky and laggy. It's not as snappy as one might hope it'd be, which is rather a disappointment. By the time an entry is ready to be typed, I'm already a little frustrated at how long it had taken to load up. Not exactly a great motivator for someone who wants to write short, yet consistent journal entries when the app saps a bit of your patience each time you want to write something. Or completely crashes.

On another note, I've seen a lot of people talk about synchronisation issues, but I encountered no issues there‚ÄîDO2 synced just fine through their private servers.

Overall, DO2 would be an excellent purchase for those who haven't got the original‚Äîas long as they fix all the lagging and crashing issues, which I'm sure they will at some point.

For many existing DO2 users, I'd say it wasn't worth the switch. I would, however, be concerned that they'd stop supporting and updating the classic version completely.

The new program, Day One 2 has some changes from the Classic, but the two programs aren't different enough to require me to buy it a second time.  It is an update that they have named a ""new, separate"" app to milk more money out of their clientele.  That was disappointing to me.

I've had no problem with the change in syncing.  Both worked fine.  Being able to post more than one picture per entry is something that should have been in Day One Classic in the first place.  I miss the function of being able to scroll through all the pictures without opening and closing each entry separately.

I would also like to be able to chose what portion, or which entries I export rather than have to export the whole journal each time.

Audio selections would also be appreciated, in addition to the photos.

The price point is so much higher than other journal apps I have and having to purchase separate programs for the Mac and my other devices is an additional slap.  There are no other programmers that nickel and dime me so deeply.

All in all, though, I spend time in this app everyday.

I do wish there were integrations for Evernote and/or Google Drive. I use Evernote as my ""vault"" for all of my personal data. This is both for searching through my archived data, as well as a form of backup (but don't rely on Evernote as your only backup). 

I also wish you could attach PDFs to journal entries. For example, sometimes I will write or receive a letter and I would like to attach the PDF of it to a journal.

The IFTTT integrations are fantastic. I use Todoist, and when I complete a task, IFTTT records it to my productivity journal. When I wake up, IFTTT records my sleep from my health journal.

However, it was frustrating knowing that I had a great journal entry but writing it out would take more time than what I could afford. I would end up writing nothing instead. This app has allowed me to write on the go, and typing has allowed me to write faster and longer entries for half the time. I write while drinking a cup of coffee, waiting in b/w classes, or just about anywhere I bring my phone or iPad.  The feature that I love the most is that you can capture photos, and sometimes you don't want to write but as the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. One last thing.

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sync options.

My main issue is this, I'm okay using a customer sync engine. It makes this easier for support and longer term customizability. However, you need to make sure your users understand the security and the reasons behind this beyond just a simple statement. Level one of communication is the What. This has been addressed. You need to communicate the How and the Why. But first, you need to start with the Why, then talk about the How, then the What will follow. Why could simply be it allows you to support customers better, including the increased number of customers. How, this is where you need to explain more about security and create a simple info graphic to tell me that my private journal entries are indeed secure. The What simply will follow as increased security, system stability and support is better for everyone in the relationship (developer and customer). 

Other than that, keep up the great work. Big changes often require big explanations that speak to the person like my sister who uses this to the very technically adept user like me who wants to make sure that sever side data is encrypted and stored with private keys that only I have.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:01,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1381079609,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9487089?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9487089

In the previous version, I paid the extra few dollars to have the application also on my MacBook... It's nice to use when I have a thought and I am sitting at a computer, instead of trying to type on my phone.

So I bought the upgrade on iOS first, then found out that the new Mac OS version is currently priced $30. While this is a nice application to use, I can't see paying $30 for the desktop version. This is not a critical must have app for me, so that feels like a rip off. 

Also, I am disappointed with being forced into using their sync service, instead of having access to Dropbox or iCloud. So I am really going to look for something else. In the meantime, I am just going no continue to use the ""classic"" version.

They did not ""abandon iCloud"" here or charge money for an update.  This is a NEW VERSION of Day One, and if you want to use it you will have to pay all of $5 - $10 (!), and learn to live with their excellent sync service.  If you love the classic Day One, keep using it.  It is not going away, or being abandoned.  If you want iCloud sync, stick with the Classic version, do not expect this version to meet that need.  The developers have done everything possible to communicate the fact that iCloud and Dropbox would not be available in v2, and why.  It makes sense to me, and if I really want to keep using iCloud sync I can stick with Day One Classic.  I recommend going to the developer website and reading their blog post from a week or so ago, which outlines why the changes and what they see as the benefit of using Day One Sync instead of iCloud.

I have used Day One for a few years now,  and I have always loved it.  Journaling is very important in my life, I have done it since I was a kid and I have boxes of paper journals archived away.  The original Day One was my go-to journal from the first day I downloaded it.

It empowers your journals with excellent features such as Tags, locations, weathers, pictures and now even with the music that you are currently listening to. 

The only gripe I have it with so far is the app doesn't have a list of ""emotions"" I might want to add. Imagine sorting your journals with ""happiness"" or ""sadness"". This feature would make it my primary app even for dream journaling which is now reserved to the app- Dreamboard.

However, ever since the app was upgraded to Day One 2, I felt that it lost its best feature, which was its simplicity and economy of design. This app now has way more icons, small enough to need care when tapping on them. In addition, I don't think the cloud sync feature works as reliably as it used to, since sometimes entries don't match between iPad, iPhone and Mac versions. It may be that my file is already too large, but formerly I didn't feel insecure about losing entries. I do now.

I don't really care about being able to use more than one photo per entry, as I do feel that the purpose of journaling in the first place is to set everything into words, and many photos can kill this purpose, losing all the psychological benefits of doing so.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1373688253,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486557?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486557

Things I hope to see in the near future:
1) Live photo integration
2) Make it easier to manage tag system - to change a tag across entries and have tags within tags.

New app is clean and smooth. I've run into a few crashes and bugs, but even the biggest apps have those issues after a major upgrade. 

I gladly paid for an upgrade to this wonderful new app. I had no qualms because the app is extremely valuable to me as a record of my life and of priceless memories with my children that are so easy to forget. I also use Evernote to keep a journal, but I keep coming back to Day One because of its simplicity and powerful features for combining photos with my notes and other metadata.

I switched to Day One's in-house sync a few weeks ago when I saw it would be necessary for multi-photo posts etc, so the lack of support for other services doesn't present a problem for me. I export my posts as PDFs at the end of every month, so I'm okay using their newer service despite its short track record.

Only having one journal for all my thoughts limited my desire to want to use the app. Only being able to upload one picture per post was something I found bizarrely limiting. 

These two features have changed in the new app, which is weirdly named Day One 2. Having multiple journals is a game changer. And now you can upload up to 10 pics. That's a great improvement. 

The UI is slick and overall intuitive. 

It seems like they have lots of improvements on the horizon, although the iPhone, iPad, and Mac additions all update differently. It seems the iPhone app is given the first priority. 

People's biggest complaint thus far? Their sync is now limited to only them. No Dropbox or iCloud option because of flaws they ran into in the Classic version. Recently they had an outage of their sync function for over a day and a half. Not good. Hopefully they work out the kinks. It doesn't seem they have any interest in reinstating Dropbox or iCloud sync options. 

But all that being said, I've found myself journaling and taking notes more than ever. It really is a great app and I look forward to the new features and updates down the road. 

Four stars instead of five for lack of consistency of features between the versions (iPad, Mac, iPhone). And the major hiccups with the sync.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1371463948,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486224?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486224

2016-04-30T17:15:03,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0.6,Gnorb,5,I used to love this app,"The first version of the Day One app was... A revelation. It was the first time I felt any journaling app could be worth my time (and money). Before then, I didn't trust journaling apps, preferring instead to simply making my own solution: Markdown pages saved in Dropbox. I could then post these to Wordpress if I so wished. 

Then the original Day One came out and, again, revelation. Suddenly I could post my journals publicly if I wanted; I could save my posts to Dropbox; I could write in a clean environment that was, largely, free of bugs. My only complaints were the one-picture limitation, and the lack of notebooks. The later was a good thing, in some ways, because it taught me the value of effective tagging. The former... Well, that could be added, right? 

Then Day One 2 came out. It promised notebooks, with the same clean interface. It was everything I wanted! So without a moment's hesitation, I plunked down the cash for both the iPhone app and the desktop app. I wanted to support this developer. 

For a while, things were OK. There were some bugs here and there, I could no longer save my stuff to Dropbox, and I could no longer publish my writings. (This was a huge disappointment.) But the overall experience was still OK. The multi-images meant the way that posts were displayed on my phone changed in a way I didn't like, but I was still willing to work with it. And the notebooks meant more information, which meant more tags. Not bad. That's a ""me"" thing, not a DayOne thing. 

But then stability issues crept in. The app would crash once in a while, more so than before. (The iPad app was rock solid. The desktop app, not so much.) This would interrupt my workflow and, sometimes, lead to data loss. After that, I noticed that when working on longer journal entries, the screen would seem to skip randomly, particularly if I was editing a completed journal, so that it would take a second to know what I was doing. 

What was once a fun experience now turned into a chore. 

And so, while I *WANT* to give this app a higher rating, while I *WANT* to give this developer all my support... I just can't. I'm thinking about moving all my stuff over. Maybe I'll do what I was doing before. Maybe I'll move to Evernote, instead. Maybe... I don't know. But I'm not happy with DayOne2. Maybe I should switch back to the original DayOne.",,,,,,,,,2022-10-29T21:20:42,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1371335594,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/135307490?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=135307490

The service had been good for about four months but now seems to be subject to unannounced downtime for maintenance and then fails to come back correctly. You can get stuck with sync in a circle of 'disabled', 'in progress' (but actually doing nothing for ages) then 'error', usually because of gateway problems. Oh and updates in the Mac version sometimes sign you out of your sync account but you only discover that when you open Preferences by chance. All in all, April appears to be a month when Day One grinds to a halt.

2016-04-26T05:47:22,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0.5,JacobSchellenberg,5,From paper to digital,"I've been writing physical journals in nice leather bound notebooks for years. I happened to search for digital journals soon after this latest update to Day One. I remember not being interested in the original version, but now I have purchased it for iOS and Mac because I have fell in love. 

The syncing is flawless. The app is beautiful on iOS and Mac. The features are perfect. I love that I can export everything in seconds, and share it if I wanted to. The timeline, the editor, adding pictures, editing entries, it's all wonderful. 

I had been slacking in journal writing lately because I simply didn't have my journal with me at all times, and often it was inconvenient and burdensome to grab a pen and journal and write at odd moments in the day.

I figured, I've always got my phone on me, so I'll give the new version of DayOne a try, and now I can say I will probably never go back to physical journaling. Yes, it's sad and there is so much I will miss about it. But now with this update and features, it has everything I required to make the switch. Now, the benefits of a digital journal out weight the cons.

Thank you DayOne. I hope your business lasts forever. Never drop your integrity, or lower your standards for evil. Be good, keep my trust, and you will have had yourself a lifetime customer.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1368948273,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9485968?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9485968

The day one classic was already my favorite app for several years on my iPhone. Day one 2 is even more powerful and yet the developer managed to retain the same elegance and ease of use from day one classic.

The new features like having multiple journals, multiple pictures, and batch-editing are implemented beautifully. There's a lot of thoughts that went into this app, and you'll experience it the more you use the app. I have over 3,000 entries so far and it's even easier for me to organize and make good use of my data than ever in day one 2.  Try it and it'll be one of the best investment you can make on your iPhone.

Update 3/22/16: still loving it.

Having used Day One (the first) for hundreds of entries I thought I'd try 2 to see what has been improved. Btw, you can try Day One 2 for free via the Apple Store iOS App - there's an ad link. 

The sync drama aside, which has been well covered by other reviews, the app itself from a UX perspective is bad. Weak. It's not as fluid and as easy to use as a journaling app as the first version. Tho not much feels like it has changed it seems design elements have been lightened for sake of design trend, which causes the overall experience to suffer. My opinion on this holds little weight, but I can say with confidence that when something just doesn't feel like it works: it doesn't work. Day One 2 could have been great. A real step forward where users where willing to pay the same again (no upgrade options guys?) for a much better improved piece of app. But instead you've got this weak, awkward and offensively priced against its perfectly working predecessor app that has done nothing but embarrass the developer. 

Oh, and the excuses around other services servers not being secure enough for the data? Give over. You're trying to move towards a subscription model and it's horribly obvious. I'll put a good bet on Day One 3 being a per-month sub app.

The second is more serious, and I'm echoing what has been stated before.

I read their terms of service and frankly some of the language was frightening, but I had a couple email exchanges with their extremely responsive customer service and I was satisfied they could not use my private entries in the future.  I've been using for two months now and their sync service is fantastic.  I had period issues with iCloud with Day One Classic, but I've never had an issue so far syncing between my iMac, iPhone, and iPad.  

The bottom line is that for YEARS I struggled to consistently journal - since getting Dayone in 2012, and now Dayone 2 - I journal more than I have in my entire life.

If you are wanting an easy way to document your life and provide a record for your posterity, then look no further. The app developers listen to feedback and this most recent version is so wonderful. There is only one feature which I wish they would bring to the app and that is the ability to have your journals printed so that I can have actual books to give to my kids and other family members. Keeping a daily journal is great for myself but I want others to be able to read them once I am no longer here. But all in all, Day One is the best journaling app there is. Don't debate if you should buy it or not. Just do it and start recording your life seamlessly.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1364309559,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486292?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486292

2016-04-15T09:19:03,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,hk,en,2.0.5,EdmundTFy,4,"Good user experience, good investment","It is finally a more mature app! Good to see that.

Good things first...
A journal app that does a lot of the job, including getting the location info of photos, predicts your ""activity"" e.g. Walking, stationary, eating etc, gets weather info, edit time/date separately, text editing that allows for 1 type of header, bold, italic, quote, list form, multiple entries per day, 8 photos per entry (not good to have a limit for sure). Nice UI, smooth app response.

Now, on the down side...
Location cannot be actively recorded and turned into automatic journals (heyday has this function and it is more useful than you can imagine!)
And there cannot be more than 1 location / 1 time stamp per entry. Now wouldn't it be great if we could split an entry into 2 locations / 2 time stamps? That could be done perhaps with a little extension on the text editing bar?
And it would be just nice to save recent thumbnails: just the very small sized photos that appear at the sidebar, not in the entry itself, so I can scroll and get visual sense of the past month quickly. Currently it is not syncing very fast with servers. And sometimes I am not with Internet on my iPad.

But that being said, still a very nice app, and can see the effort to continuously improve, so it's worth the money for your ""investment"" to paperless (and timeless) journaling.",,,,,,,,,2022-05-23T20:10:23,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1363919956,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/90132294?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=90132294

Location feature is PERFECT!,"Only a couple minor things left to fix, and this will be a 5-star review! The latest update addressed most of the big issues we were having, most notably the location issue that required multiple steps to choose your correct location. This was extremely cumbersome for my ""home"" location, which I had to manually correct every single time I made a new entry. With the new update, though, you can now SAVE LOCATIONS, which is AMAZING! DayOne was always pinning my home to the building next to mine, but once you pin your location and save it (and you can name the location whatever you want, which is super cool), DayOne now knows when I am home! Alternatively, if you are somewhere else but would like to use your home or other saved location, you can just select it from a new menu that pops up over the keyboard! Awesome! Thanks for the emoji fix as well! I'd still like to see the ""M"" button changed somehow, and to bring back the horizontal scrolling menu and the cursor buttons. I always hit the ""M"" when I move the cursor to the end of a sentence. If you guys can streamline the horizontal menu the way you did the location services, then you'll definitely get 5 stars from me!

- Night mode

- Tag music from Spotify
- Import notes from other apps and cloud drives

- With every other new version, searching inside Day One seems to become unreliable: it literally shows 0 results all the time for me right now. Very frustrating!

2016-04-01T16:24:25,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,ca,en,2.0.3,Dhohol,5,Get the 2.0 upgrade,"The first version of DayOne was a pretty little thing, and worth paying for to explore, but it lacked functionality for me to really use it on a daily basis. 

What drove me to get the 1.0 in the first place was the terrible performance behind iNotes after the big iOS update which left syncing between devices terribly broken. DayOne solved this problem by offering their own server to sync against and I was happy enough with it. 

Another drawback in the DayOne business model is that you need to pay for separate devices so I can't have a DayOne on both iPhone and Mac book. A further flaw is that they lack Windows support or even a web interface. This is strictly an iOS centric application. 

So why did I buy the 2nd edition? Simply because it solved the problem of having separate journals (really, just a higher level concept of organizing) since organizing notes with tags is fairly frustrating. They continue their business model by forcing you to buy another edition for MacBook. 

In a way, I feel ripped off because introducing Multiple journals didn't warrant an entirely new product. I think in the long term, they're really shooting themselves in the foot by focusing on an obvious short term profit model and I fail to see how they'll be able to achieve growth in userbase. 

At the same time, I'm conflicted because while 1.0 was pretty compared to Notes of Evernote - 2.0 is definitely more polished and useful. 

If making a decision - stick with 2.0 and be careful since they offer both on the App Store. Would I get a 3.0? Def not. I think any further updates would be really DLC related and it's hard to justify further iterations that would require further payment. I do see opportunity in then allowing better sharing and collaboration between other DayOne users but that's just me since I like to work on notes with other users like planning a trip or jotting down product ideas in rough form. 

In conclusion, I feel kinda fooled but at the same time, I don't regret it because even a month later, I still use DayOne for work, personal, and training notes.",,,,,,,,,2022-05-23T20:10:21,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1356962414,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/90126921?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=90126921

I like this app because there are a lot of things you couldn't normally do with a book, like post pictures on entries, record location and weather, and stuff like that.

I've tried many apps and method, including pen and paper, but the beautiful way that the Day One app presents a space for you to write, the gorgeous display of what you wrote, and the portability  really made writing stick for me. I just started writing about a month ago, but I've been writing everyday for 34 days now, and I have no intention to stop.

I don't really know how to say this, but Day One has been a part of my life and it's always on my to-do list! (Since I don't want to miss any day) It really has a huge impact on me since it also helps me to release the positive and negative vibes that I'm feeling at the moment.. instead of being annoying on the internet üòÇ 
I'm also grateful because it lets me remember the beautiful and not-so-beautiful things that happened in my life, and I can see my progress as a person! Like, who would've thought I was like that a year ago?! And now-- you've improved!! You get me? 

In addition, I'd like to ask some features... It's just simple!! So first, whenever I write an entry, can the format be justified? I'm sorry it's just my OCD and I think my entries would look much better if it's justified! I feel really weird whenever I see it's not aligned.. So yeah, I hope you give us that option! üòä

Second, with the photos, I think it would be better if it's not displayed one by one! Maybe we can arrange it into a more minimalistic format? Like, a format of a collage but it's not a collage... It's like the format in Twitter or Tumblr or something like that.. I hope you guys understand what I'm saying!! 

Aside from that, everything's perfect üòä thank you so much Day One!!

I don't know what it is but I can literally go days without remembering to post something so I thought that maybe writing in a journal would creat the habit of writing something every day.

If you are using the classic at the beginning of its existance. Most of you (classic users) will regret this b/c the stability of the classic version which has issues with other sync like dropbox and icloud atm. Is this forcing us to buy 2.0 ? 

The version 2.0 overall is great but it's pure preference. If you like the classic interface. . dont buy this or wait if they update this.

+ for making the sections between diary, journal and/or notes. I missed this one while I was on classic.

+ uploading stories classic to 2.0 works great

+ some more options which I find not needed ( read for yourself )

- no support any other sync but oneday server. Can you be trusted ?

I've always been in love with the idea of journaling, but I've always struggled to keep up the habit - until Day One. This app is the only consistent journal I've ever kept. I have tried many other apps and always come back to this one. It's gorgeous, it's easy to use, the tagging system is excellent and it integrates seamlessly with the iPad and Mac apps. I write everything in Day One, from my daily planner to random thoughts and things I'd like to remember to long reflections and poetry. I am constantly screen shotting memorable texts and emails and saving them in my Day One. I love how it automatically adds your location so that you can see entries grouped in different places - I'm able to look back at photos and entries I've taken at certain restaurants, for example, or at my sister's house. I love being able to look back on such a beautifully presented record of my life. It was well worth the money when I purchased it the first time and I bought the upgrade without hesitation and  no regrets. The redesign is beautiful, I love the option to upload multiple photos and the lack of an iCloud sync doesn't bother me - I am sure the developers are planning to add that in the future, along with the other handful of features that didn't make it to the upgrade. In conclusion: if you are looking for a quality journaling app, your search will end here. Day One is by far the best option on the App Store.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:01,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1350450495,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9487041?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9487041

It is a joy to use on the iPhone, iPad and Mac and syncs effortlessly between all devices. My only gripe is the lack of a web application. I don't always use an Apple device and would like the freedom of not being locked in to always needing an iOS or OS X device just so I can use  this app. I hear it's coming, but it's been coming for a long time now. 

On more than a few occasions the excellent search feature has helped me out quickly when needing to find out some details in one of my entries. The tag system assists here too.

Journaling daily has been an indispensable tool for me to document my life's activities, meals, happenings and periodic thoughts.  I write practically everything that's important to me into my Day One journal like my daily body weight, the meals I eat and periodic workouts.  I also record where I go/places I visit and my grocery shopping lists into the app.

It would be absolutely phenomenal if other apps like fitness apps and scales (iHealthLabs WiFi scales/FitBit workout straps) integrated with Day One Journal to record important information like body weight, body fat% and run/workout data (heart rate) at the time that they are measured.  It would also be useful if ""check ins"" were recorded from your iPhone when you go somewhere so that you don't have to write this by hand.  This might represent the future for journaling in the technology age.  

The new 2.0 update has been wonderful because it allows for up to 10 inline photos per entry which makes my entries look much more detailed and professional almost akin to reading a magazine.  The 2.0 update is much more robust than previous versions.  However, there are many bugs / issues that need to be addressed by the development team.  For example, some of my ""most used"" tags don't show up with their proper occurrence frequency/number.  I also can't flip through my journal on iPad without hitting the arrows at the bottom of the screen.  Tag management and bulk editing tags on iPad iOS needs to be implemented as well.

I use my iPad Air 2 as my primary journaling device because it's much more portable than a laptop and journaling with it is much more intimate.  Also, I take pictures of my meals with my iPad's camera that's already a part of the device.  I currently use the Logitech ""LOGI"" Blok protective keyboard case to type effortlessly into my journal.  I currently feel that the iPad is the best device to journal with.

Overall a 5 star app!!!!  Thanks, Day One!!!",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1348859086,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486343?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486343

This is such a great app, I am in love and have been journaling more than ever. It caters for every one of my needs and not a day goes by where I'm not either writing it or looking back on memories, which I've been able to do from importing from my old journal. 
Easy to record, organise, look back on and use I LOVE IT.

My only suggestion would be to add multiple locations and dates to an entry? For example I like to record an entire weekends events in one log and I can only choose one location and date but other than that it's fab and I've recommended to all my similarly nostalgic friends and family!",,,,,,,,,2022-05-05T12:54:46,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1345234469,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/79734591?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=79734591

It lags and doesn't flow as gracefully & seamlessly as the old version.   There are problems & delays when going from landscape to portrait position while dictating with the iPhone.  It crashes without warning and has lots of bugs.  It's now clunky and cumbersome where it once was sleek and efficient.

From the moment I got the app I was journaling like a fiend. The only 2 apps I have on my home screen are DayOne Classic and Camera+. I love everything about DayOne Classic, in particular the sounds, the ability to swipe vertically through the entries with sounds, the smooth scrolling through the timeline, and the publishing option, to name but a few. As far as I was concerned, this was the perfect app. My timeline looked neat: one photo and one text block per entry - just beautiful symmetry.

After a month of very happy journaling, I was quite alarmed to see that DayOne Classic was no longer available and had been replaced by DayOne 2. I wondered what on earth had been so wrong with DayOne Classic that it needed a complete overhaul. Concerned that a) I would no longer be able to use my journal if I didn‚Äôt get the new app and b) I would lose out on the 50% off price if I didn‚Äôt buy the new one immediately; I took the plunge.
 
I spent some time going through DayOne 2 without importing my entries. First impressions were not great for me. I personally have no need for multiple journals and multiple photos per entry. Life is complicated enough! One journal and one photo per entry keep things simple and aesthetically pleasing. Nevertheless I forged ahead and set everything up on DayOne 2, importing my journal. Rather miffed that I had to pay twice in the space of a month for the app, I was determined to make it work for me. Perhaps I should be more concerned about privacy but, having used DayOne sync in Classic, the removal of iCloud and Dropbox was of no concern to me.

As of this date I have moved to DayOne 2 and moved back to DayOne Classic twice. I just can‚Äôt be friends with DayOne 2 and dread the day when Classic is no longer supported. For those of us who love Classic, I‚Äôm begging Bloom Built to continue to maintain it. It was perfect for me and I can‚Äôt bring myself to use DayOne 2. Actually it feels like a betrayal of something I love. Vertical swiping through the entries (with sounds) is part of the joy of Classic.

It‚Äôs hard to quantify my dissatisfaction with DayOne 2; I don‚Äôt like the scratchy scrolling through the timeline and horizontal swiping through entries (with no sounds) just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. I‚Äôm sticking with Classic for as long as I can until I‚Äôm forced to move to 2. At that point I‚Äôll either have to make a determined effort to learn to love it or use a different journaling app altogether. I don‚Äôt want to do that ‚Äì Classic is perfect for me.",,,,,,,,,2022-05-05T12:54:46,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1340004805,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/79734588?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=79734588

As it stands I simply have to use another app to compose text, then upload to DayOne via the share menu. The share sheet works incredibly--my text shoots to DayOne without even opening the app. Which is good because opening the DayOne app is when the issues arise.

On my iPhone 6s Plus, switching into landscape mode to write with my bluetooth keyboard is...unpleasant. If I tap the plus sign to begin a new entry then switch into landscape mode, I am exited from the new entry back into the entries list. I then have to tap the new blank entry that was just created, then it appears on the right side of the split-view screen. I then have to tap edit before I am able to begin typing, and even then I am only given half the screen to type in. There is nothing I can tap to make the compose screen expand across the entire screen and I am forced to write in a square about 2 inches across. This was not the case in the previous version and is enough to make me compose elsewhere.

Lastly, I'd like to also add my voice to the cries for iCloud syncing. Not that I don't trust DayOne, it's simply because I trust more in iCloud's security, stability, and longevity.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1338608332,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486781?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486781

I waited a few days before upgrading, considering whether to stick with the now classic version. I read a lot of reviews about people decrying the lost of iCloud sync which is mostly uninformed fear mongering. In the end, I decided to upgrade and I'm happy I did.

Although the Day One team dismisses customers upset by dropping iCloud and Dropbox sync as being a ""fraction of a percentage"" of users, it's actually a huge deal for those who desire to have choice in their sync solution.

Instead of listening to customer requests that it be added back, the team has become increasingly defensive with their customer feedback, promising vaporware features coming in the next few months that they say couldn't be done with iCloud--services that I neither need or want--and teasing future ""premium"" subscription options. They say that greater-than-iCloud level encryption is one of the things that's coming, but with a company the size of Bloom Built it's hard to imagine they'd wind up doing anything but folding over if the government does come calling, much like secure email company Silent Circle. 

The real nerve isn't even that this is a thinly veiled move into becoming a ""software as a service"" company, but that the Day One team doubled the price of the software as well. If you want me to buy your subscription service, that's one thing, but then to charge me a premium price on the app that for the same price I could get professional quality photo and vector illustration apps (that support iCloud)? It's really a stretch. 

At this point, it's hard to see this 2.0 app as anything but a money-grab ahead of the introduction of premium features that could, in fact, be supported with existing sync servjces. But instead of being limited only by my existing iCloud storage space to store images and (presumably in the future) videos, I'll have to pay Bloom Built AGAIN to have the privilege of incorporating videos in my journal. It wouldn't tax Bloom Built's servers (or their Money Bin) at all to just allow external sync options for that sort of thing.

I bought this software on both the Mac and iOS expecting the quality care of a team I've supported since 2011, but instead, I feel like I'm setting myself up for a bait and switch. I cannot recommend anyone purchase this app until iCloud/Dropbox service is restored for the combined $50 price (along with a commitment for features they reasonably CAN support).

Nothing has improved after two updates. Still slow to respond in iPad Air and can't scroll pictures in iPhone 5s.

The team is actually overconfident to release their new version which is overpriced and buggy. They also fail to see the unique value of their app with the cloud server they could choose. They try to promote their cloud but it's incomplete due to the lack of security at this moment.

And on one hand they allow unlimited cloud storage, on the other they force all the diary to be downloaded to my small 16GB iPhone, which is a silly design.

What it told me is that their business model does not include ads or selling my information.  With that in mind it was easy to decide to pay for the upgrade so they can fund their business and I can have my privacy.

My second dissatisfaction has to do with the sharing for tumblr and Twitter. Previously tumbler also posted the hashtags from Day One. Now when using the Share Sheet tool only the photo get posted, none of the hashtags which makes it a real nuisance adding them manually once more. The same goes for the Twitter shares, no hashtags or metadata is exported from Day One. Only the photo and diary entry. Extremely annoying. 

So, the lack of Foursquare (Swarm) sharing, despite it being promised, and the lack of export hashtags and metadata from Day One in the Share Sheet tool makes this an huge downgrade from the previous app. Very unfortunate indeed because I really enjoyed that app and its purpose, now this has became the most unnecessary app imaginable. Writing posts and not being able to share them easily on other platforms seems like a joke. An expensive joke nevertheless.

The Negatives:-
Sending your diary in PDF is not ideal, especially as an email attachment whilst travelling as Internet can be difficult what happened to ""publish"" and sending the link? People could see what music you were listening too, see on the map where you were and see your photo's in full screen, plus read all your adventures - now all gone. The PDF does not show enough info and maps and looks cold compared to seeing it on the screen as the old link allowed recipients to,  bring back the publish and link option!!!  

Had some issues with loading and date timing 10 photo's, however an update seems to have resolved this issue.

The app has bugs and problems, after the original day one classic why didn't you take the time to get it right!! The original worked too perfection and I never had a problem with uploading, syncing and publishing and it was brilliant for a daily travel blog - come guys you can do better than this!!

The Positives:
The new layout, slightly different from the old app but looks good, better in fact. 
The prospect of being able physically publish your diary into a book is fantastic but will that option be available to the UK and Europe as well?? And when??
If these problems were ironed out and publishing was brought back this would once again be one of the best travel diary/blogs on the app market. Remember it is marketed as a travel journal - internet is not always great, therefore publishing was fantastic as it meant not having to send out attachments onto email's - just one simple link! 
3 stars for now, as it needs a lot of refining to make it better than the original and to bring back some of the best stuff in the original. However as stated the first update is out and the first improvements, so hopefully in a few weeks time this will be getting the same five stars the original got and deserved.

While I am really happy about this upgrade, I am a bit underwhelmed here. The app works fine, and I haven't run into any problems, but DARN. This app is BRIGHT. The white hurts my eyes if I stare at the screen too long, the blues contrast sharply with the whites, and the landscape on this new upgrade is... interesting, to say the least.

Features for the future would be:
- Night mode in the ""Style"" settings.
- Ability to choose different colors for the overall look of the app; despite me not minding the color scheme of this app, it would be nice to have less glaring colors, like beige or something.

I guess that's about it from me. It's a good app, but the colors and the brightness and the contrast hurts my eyes.

V. 2.0.1
The bug fixes are nice, but now my app crashes when reading entries now? I haven't tested it, but it looks like it crashes when reading entries from the Classic version.

And I am still waiting for that Night Mode. I have grown accustomed to the light blue set against the bright, stark white background.

Still seems a bit underwhelming as well. I understand the reason why iCloud and Dropbox were dropped, but still, it would be a neat idea to off them via IAP for $0.99 or something like that. You guys would still get revenue, and you would have people get their iCloud and Dropbox support.

V. 2.0.2

Eh, it's okay. Not as brilliant as the Classic, but the iPad app is amazing and beautiful. Just wished that there was a way to write a journal in landscape mode on the iPhone 6s + without having half the screen being used for the actual writing.

I also am mistrustful of this decision to force a move to the developer‚Äôs propriatery sync solution. 

I appreciate that the developers are trying to do what they see as the right thing in providing a sync solution that is more reliable than iCloud used to be. iCloud sync has markedly improved in the last 18 months, however, and Apple has a team dedicated to making this platform work. They also have the deep pockets to stand up to the US Federal government on data privacy, as we are now seeing play out in the court system. A small developer, however well-intentioned, simply isn‚Äôt in the same position to do these things. 

If you need a source of ongoing revenue, as I suspect this sync play to eventually become, look to Marco Arment‚Äôs patronage model for Overcast. You have (or maybe had until this decision?) a dedicated group of fans using your product who likely would be willing to support you.

It appears that I can still make backups (not sync) to Dropbox but I've yet to determine how to make them regular. This is important as I prefer to keep backups in several places.

I love the new features added in! Thank you to the developers for all their hard work. However, I feel I must give two stars because:

1) After importing classic entries from Day One Classic (v1), the app crashes when I open an entry to view it, returning me to the home screen. This happens repeatedly. NOTE: I reinstalled Day One 2 without importing old entries, and I'm able to use it to create NEW entries without crashing -- so the crashing may be connected with having imported entries from Day One Classic. I have reported this to support.

2) I'm very disappointed by the removal of iCloud sync. I feel much more secure having my data synced through iCloud. Please add it back in! If it is not re-added, I may end up just sticking with Day One Classic in the end, even though the new features (multiple journals, multiple photos per entry) look amazing.

Again, thank you to the developers for the new features. I sincerely hope you will consider re-adding iCloud sync -- that is a big deal for a lot of customers, and may be a deal breaker for me for using Day One 2.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1333928063,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486622?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486622

Now Bloom Built, the company that makes Day One, has decided for me that I am to use their syncing service without the ability to use iCloud anymore. Not only that, if you read their website, apparently they're trying to turn Day One into some kind of social platform.

I'm hoping the ability to publish makes a comeback soon (I'm a bit mystified about why it didn't make the cut for 2.0), but I'm willing to wait. The advantage of multiple journals is worth it.

The easy access to Markdown formatting is nice, and multiple journals and photos should have been in 1.x but it's good to have them.

Main problems with this update:
- user interface is different, but not necessarily better. Tags and stars are hidden from the default view in favour of a map view.
- battery drain is shocking, even with background app refresh turned off. Five minutes a day of journalling in my iPhone uses 10% of its battery.

Unfortunately, with version 2, now the images are not stretching all the way from left to right anymore which makes it look like an amateur layout of a Kindergarden pamphlet. Especially in vertical view this is lame. Furthermore, there used to be a consistant colored top bar. Now it's black or blue at left but white at right. Too bad the feel for simplicity in design is going away. For example I love the idea to know where a certain entry had taken place, but do I really always need to see a non telling little micro cut-out of a map at the bottom of my article that looks like an advertising banner? Heck, if I really want to check out the location on a larger map, I can still tap on it. To be fair, there are some improvements and great new features, but what makes DayOne stand out is the design.

There are some decent updates to the presentation and interface, but very little has changed, and even less of that is for the better. I'm still irritated that you can't manually enter fields like weather and music, and it's odd that most of the new features seem based on product symmetry gimmicks rather than user-driven improvements. Perhaps the developer sees a demand for smartwatch/journal integration that I don't. If that sort of novelty does it for you, welcome aboard.

Now, to speak directly to some of  the complaints. Boy, oh boy! Y'all need to take a breath!

In a hundred years I will not understand people who complain about paid updates. I like to put money in the pockets of people who do good work. If they had changed nothing and simply said they needed extra money to continue working on the app, I would have ponied up, no problem. But, they have released some new features and obviously more on the way. 

Sync? I am no more concerned about this sync service than I am any other. But, I would like if they would support the previous services sometime soon, if only so heavy sync users like myself can consolidate the number of services we use.

Anyway, I am not a power user who relies on this app for my existence. So take my review with a grain of salt.

Syncing really is pretty fast. I've had no problems with crashing, so I wonder if those who do have crashing trouble should chalk it up to user error.

This is why, despite some reservations, I paid for both updates. It's a bit like how I'll pay extra for an album I love even though I already subscribe to Apple Music. But I just hope Bloom understands that this kind of goodwill has its limits. I've never had to pay for an upgrade to an app I've already bought, except for absolute essentials like MS office. I'm taking it on faith that Bloom's private servers will eventually be as secure as iCloud, and that they have no ulterior motives in moving it there, like data mining or the plan to turn Day One into a subscription-based service.

You can add multiple photos to each entry, and they display beautifully alongside each entry in the timeline view. It's best if you have the Mac app alongside this one as they stay in sync perfectly.

But my disappointment is so great with this latest version of Day One that I feel compelled to share my experience.  First, I loved the original Day One.  Rarely did I have sync or crash issues - and the one time I needed to contact customer service, I received prompt feedback and the problem was resolved with the next update (and a work-around was provided until then).  I upgraded yesterday to the new version of the app - because I didn't want to miss out on the 50% off price - and because I have been such a fan of this app.  Unfortunately I cannot give a very good recommendation on the new app.  Unlike others, my migration from the old app to the new seemed to work fine.  For me the issue is that the application crashes and closes every time I go to view a different entry.  I really don't care about the planned enhancements - or where it's stored ( I don't put anything that personal in here anyway) - but I do care if the core functionality is there and that it doesn't crash every time you look back at your journal.  Until the crashing is fixed - I can't recommend this app anymore.  I hope this wasn't just a beta version that was put out to test on early adopters - and then the price will go up when they fix the bugs.  I don't appreciate being used as a beta tester like this.

And one last note - there is no way to turn off the irritating quotes that they now load onto my home page.

If you use iCloud or Dropbox, then your data is being securely transmitted and stored the same way as Day One Sync. Neither iCloud, Dropbox, or Day One Sync use private key encryption currently. This is where your data is encrypted locally with a private key only known to you before it is sent to a server.

Here is an excerpt directly from Day One's website describing their plans for private-key encryption:

""In 2016, we will develop and provide full private-key encryption on the server in our 2.1 release for iOS and Mac apps by May 2016. Our encryption features will utilize the user's private key to encrypt all entries before they reach the server. In short, the server will have no access to the user's unencrypted data. Neither iCloud nor Dropbox currently provide this level of security, thus making Day One Sync even more secure than these other sync/backup methods.""

Yes, it's apparent that forcing the user to use Day One Sync is paving the way to a subscription based model. Day One is pivoting because being able to sustain themselves on one-time app purchases is not a viable option as their userbase continues to grow. They're rolling their own sync because they have had problems with syncing journal data to iCloud and Dropbox. Writing their own sync engine will make it so they have more granular control making syncing more efficient and secure. Yes, this will piss off a lot of existing users but people have to realize that this is a business decision that will benefit both parties.

Bugs are inevitable especially when an app is first released or rewritten. I'm sure the developers are working hard to fix these bugs.

Keep calm and journal on people.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1331485574,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486978?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486978

With this update a little of that was lost. I loved how you had the full bleed image on every photo even if it's a portrait gave it that magazine feel. With this version it shows the photo in full portrait which feels allot let elegant. Also with the bolted on Google maps location at the bottom removes from that magazine style feel as well. 

I wish there was an option to turn that off and full bleed on. Just make a swipe left and right on the photos as well so you see the page looking wonderful.

2016-02-11T01:26:08,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,gb,en,2.0.1,likeshampoo,1,Say goodbye to your privacy for a couple of new features,"I really like Day One, I journal every day with it. The feature I've really been dying for most is uploading multiple pictures in one entry and now that works great. 

However, that's the only feature that is of any real note able difference. The design has changed slightly, I'm sure I'll appreciate extra journals as time goes on but even at half price, it's far too expensive. Especially considering there are other journaling apps that do almost the exact same for a lot less. 

The Mac app is ridiculously expensive as well. Even as an every day user, I can't justify spending ¬£20, on what's essentially the default Notes app can do - and that's free. 

My other gripe as well is the fact that there terms and conditions state they can use your content as they wish. Using this as a personal journal, it's quite frankly ludicrous. I'm having to go back through my entire journal and edit snippets to protect other people's privacy - even though they no doubt keep backups of multiple versions so it doesn't hugely matter anyway - just in the of case something might get publicised and it kind of then defeats the personal aspect of journaling. 

I'm not sure why you can't attach videos in your entries either. I'm guessing it's because you can export entries to PDF but why not omit they video or choose a thumbnail for it so it's gets treated like a photo once it's exported? This seems like such a wasted feature. 

Besides these gripes, the app itself is actually very good and works well. I've only had one crash and considering I downloaded it on day one... excuse the pun, it's a welcome bonus that developers are actually testing their apps decently enough, something which is becoming a dying art nowadays. If you're coming from the original Day One app, content migrates to the new app very quickly and looks just how you remember them. 

Maybe my review is harsh but throwing away your privacy on a very personal app is a bitter pill to swallow. Are they selling these things to other companies so they can use it for data? Why do they need access to the content and why? Also, what's stopping anyone from hacking their servers and getting other people's private information that they've disclosed too? I'm sure users that have used Day One regularly for years will be more upset than me, I've only been using it for a couple of months so I guess I consider myself lucky that it's not years of data and personal information I've signed away, unknowingly, when I downloaded this app at first. 

Unless they change their T&C's regarding this, I will always rate this app one star. It might be unjust but I'm sick of companies stealing what should be personal to us. It's unnecessary and without giving you disclosure of this to begin with, it's deceptive and devious. 

Here's a personal journaling app that we've made for YOU! Want perceived security? With our lock feature, no-one will read your personal information without your code!

.... (any information you disclose in this app is for our personal use and we can use it in whatever way we want, we may sell this information and profit off of your lack of actual privacy. also we'll charge you a premium for it and not tell you up front about any of this :) )",,,,,,,,,2022-05-05T12:54:47,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1331062986,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/79735929?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=79735929

Still bad.,"So far, the new version won't pick up and show location or weather in entries on my iPad Air. It has frozen on me twice and simply quit working and disappeared suddenly twice. Less screen space is devoted to your written entry and more to the menus than the previous version, which is not a plus. The app is supposed to be about your journal entry, not menus. Even so, other menu items are tiny and at the bottom of the entry and you have to click on three dots for ""more."" I can't see any improvement and the new version appears to be very unstable.

I downloaded the update thinking it would solve the location/weather problem, but no. It still can't capture that data. And now they have renamed it to Day One. If you are still using the ""classic"" version, like me, waiting for the new one to get fixed, how are you going to be able to tell which is which?

The only option is the Day One sync. Right now, February 2016, this function is free, but it could easily become a subscription service which I suspect is their plan. 

In general still a beautiful way to journal but with a few hiccups. When I synced my old journal with the new one I got hundreds of duplicate entries and photos. I went through and manually deleted all of them, but it was a pain. When scrolling through my list of entries there is a jerkiness. It is not a smooth scroll on my iPhone 6 Plus. Also I have had the screen freeze up when editing so that no buttons are responsive. I would have expected better from a two-year effort.

You can indeed add up to 10 pictures to a journal entry, something that's been available in most other journaling apps for years. The other biggie is multiple journals, yet another thing that is been available on competing apps for years. 

Change is always hard. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out.

Added 2/9/16- Just dropped a star to 2 stars. A new ""feature"" must be the half screen landscape mode on the iPhone. So now you have exactly the same amount of real estate to write on in landscape than in portrait. Why did they even bother with landscape. Why do they have those huge camera and plus icons? All the other icons are minuscule.

Second, when you leave the app after editing and then come back to it by tapping the icon you briefly see the page you were editing before the security page. Why are you seeing a page from your private journal BEFORE the security screen? Anybody who wanted to look at your journal would see this page.  I think I will join the crowd that is going back to DO Classic.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:01,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1330945739,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9487182?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9487182

Right, there were some photo sync delays mostly in few hours after version 2 was released. Well, it was most probably caused by so many people syncing their old journals at the same moment. After while everything worked very smoothly.

Data encryption remains the same problem as it was in previous version, now it is only highlighted due to lack of dropbox/icloud sync. I would like to have the option to choose the sync platform as well, I agree. But I‚Äôm hoping (and I trust Bloom) the version 2.1 will be data security focused patch

I will continue with the last complain I have and it is map layout on iPad. I think it should use more space that iPad offers..

All others are only improvements and features you will love to use. Multiple journals are absolutely great!. Personally I don‚Äôt care to attach more than 1 photo but if you do, you‚Äôll be satisfied. Filtering by metadata is awesome! Maps on iPhone are awesome! UI remains simple and nice looking - awesome!

Do you journal? There is no better way than start with Day One 2! Once data is encrypted - I‚Äôll gladly change the rate to full 5 stars.

I LOVE the option to finally have multiple journals.

I agree with others that the PDF export isn't as good now because the photos are smaller, however they are still plenty big. 

Within the journal clicking the photo enlarges it, that part I find annoying is the geotag box at the bottom of the photo that is always in the way and distracts from the photo.

I am very frustrated by the lack of cloud/dropbox support, however their own sync seems to work well. I do not rely on web based storage for my backups, just sync. I always backup to PDF.

So far I like the new version, but I am glad I got it for 50% off. Would hate to pay full price for this app.

2016-02-09T16:53:42,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0,TumbleBumbleatNight,5,Fantastic journaling app,"I was an avid user of the origins DayOne. When 2.0 was announced, I didn't hesitate to buy it. It's a beautiful app, feature rich with lots of great improvements. For journaling this app just works. I have used it for years and have no plans to stop anytime soon. 

I was hesitant to switch to 2.0 because of the syncing issue. I had used Dropbox syncing for years and it generally worked ok. That said, the DayOne sync is a vast improvement. No more lags and glitches like I had with both the Dropbox and iCloud syncing. I do understand the concern re: data privacy, but my understanding is that the DayOne sync is using the same security methods as Dropbox, so I don't really see a difference there. In addition, once they are able to get encryption out there with v2.1, DayOne 2 is going to be MORE secure than iCloud and Dropbox. Their syncing service is the foundation for giving people encryption, which is what folks have been requesting for years! 

I'm happy with the new syncing method and will be even happier when they release 2.1 with encryption. I know they are getting a lot of criticism for dropping Dropbox and iCloud syncing, but they are also ultimately giving people what they want - a way to make your journal truly private. 

Overall, this is a great app. It's one of the few I recommend to people as a ""must buy"" and it's the only app I have gifted to a number of friends and family (this actually makes a great present for people. It's the modern version of buying someone a beautiful journal).",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1330417973,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486842?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486842

Every entry you create and export as a PDF is tagged at the bottom 'created with day one' which I find insufferably twee. I am not your marketing vehicle.

Furthermore, the 2.0 version offers no compelling reason to abandon the 1.0 version, and removes the choice of iCloud and Dropbox sync. Instead we are to use their own servers, but as I can't find anything about what they want to do with our data, or what could happen to it if Day One sold itself or went bankrupt, I would rather NOT trust it to keep my private life out of the ad-driven economy.

The good? It uses markdown, so I can export basic text into another markdown app like Ulysses. The bad? So far as I can tell, when you do so you export only text, not dates or tags.

2016-02-08T16:42:45,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0,1Macman,5,Fantastic Update to an Incredible App,"I‚Äôve been using both the iOS and Mac versions of Day One, for over two years now and love it. This new version, adds some exciting new features and is a major upgrade, in my opinion. The UI is smooth and beautiful to look at, it allows you to have multiple journals, with different names and colors and also adds the ability, to have up to ten photographs, in each journal entry.

My journal is quite large and I didn't have any issues with syncing it, from the now classic version. It took less than a minute and after looking through the journal, everything was there, just like the original. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem, because I've been using their sync service, since they released it, back in May, of 2015. I too, use iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive as well as a few others, but can honestly say, that after switching to their own sync service, haven't had a single issue.

I don‚Äôt understand why all the negative reviews, for dropping other sync services or having to pay, for the new version. I trust them completely and I‚Äôm not concerned about security issues, any more than I am, with another service. As far as having to pay for the new version, Bloom Built, released 40 updates to the original version, in the last 5 years and never once, charged you for it. I think you got your money‚Äôs worth.

Has everyone forgotten about CD‚Äôs and DVD‚Äôs and how we used to get our software. It came on physical media and when a company, put out an update, we had to pay for it. In todays world, people have gotten greedy and always want something for nothing. They think that once they buy software, they are entitled to free updates, for life, well that‚Äôs not how it works. What if you were in their shoes and the company you worked for, gave your product away, for free. You wouldn‚Äôt get paid, couldn‚Äôt feed your family and your company wouldn‚Äôt be in business, very long. So stop complaining.

Day One 2, is an incredible update, to an already top notch app and I recommend it to everyone. It‚Äôs worth every penny, is a joy to use and the sync service works great. Now I‚Äôm going to go buy, the Mac version.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1329913945,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486822?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486822

Under new sync, it's fully encrypted and inaccessible by their staff. It's all on Amazon s3.  This is as good as it gets and frankly there have been persistent issues and frustrations with sync on iCloud for many apps so this really isn't a big deal.  And the developer was clear they did it to facilitate capability that wasn't available with iCloud and Dropbox sync.  

I'm very pleased with the new functionality and want this developer to succeed so they can continue to improve an already awesome app.",,,,,,,,,2022-10-29T21:20:55,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1329654087,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/135307566?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=135307566

But I thought I‚Äôd give it a try regardless.  Installed it on my iPad, imported my ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù journal with no problem.  Installed on my iPhone, it synced everything perfectly.  Poking around, seems fine.   Next morning, poke around some more.  While I‚Äôm looking at the settings dialog on my iPad, I see in the background my whole journal vaporize.   I pick up my iPhone, launch Day One 2, and seconds later the journal vanishes.

I sent the logs off to Bloom Built.  At one point in the log, the iPad starts a sync. It determines that there is no journal ID on the server matching the local one, despite the push notification for the sync containing the journal ID from the server.  So logically it DELETES the local journal. Then to make absolutely sure that a possibly transient error becomes permanent, it then appears to dispatch a message to delete the original journal on the server!  Twice!  And after it all, push notifications to sync the ORIGINAL journal ID continue to arrive.

I've become more mindful and more grateful, and that's pretty special to me. But about 6 months ago, wary about the wealth of personal information I was entrusting to a third-party, I stopped cloud syncing and have been manually backing up in iTunes since. To me, the most important characteristic a journal should have is confidentiality. When you sync with Dropbox or iCloud, you are ultimately trusting engineers at Dropbox or Apple to not peek at your data. Clearly those companies are going to have rules against such access (except in those cases where they are forced to disclose, which in the US gives authorities numerous ways to get your data...), but those are policy constraints, not technical constraints. You don't hold the keys to your journal. Maybe you're cool with that. I'm not. 

I think the new update is pretty great. I'm not super-fond of all the center-aligned boxes; that selecting tags actively hides what I've written; nor that my writing window in landscape is the same size as my journal entries. But what I'm most excited for is the 2.1 update when I can wrap my writing in a encryption key of my own creation. Good on Bloom for listening to their users' feature requests; I'm happy to pay you again, and I can't wait to begin automatic syncing again.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:01,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1329519300,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9487144?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9487144

Like other reviews say, no iCloud sync is a letdown, but not a huge deal. I just signed up for a day one account and thought sync would work across that. Well, it doesn't. At least not right now. Nothing syncs. I tried to import all my entries from the previous version, and at first it seemed to work. Then I went to add a new entry and noticed all my old entries are gone. Tried to import again, same issue happens. So I figured I'd try to just write a new entry, and figure out the import later. Got halfway through an entry, and the app closed it, saying ""another device is posting an entry."" Not possible; I only have the app on one device. 

Long story short, the glitches and shortcomings of this new app make it almost worthless for someone that really enjoyed the old version.

Some nice new features, multiple journals, map view, add multiple images to an entry, all are welcome additions to Day One.

However...
Sadly you are now forced to use Day One's own sync service, no more iCloud and no more Dropbox.
There are a couple of reasons I am not happy about this, if you have an iPhone or Mac your will already have an iCloud account, now if you want to sync you are forced to sign up for yet another account, an account you have little control over. If the developers decided to sell Day One and the new owners decided to shut it (which happens regularly with tech start-ups) or if it doesn't pay and the developers  decided to call it a day, the app would still work but we would lose the sync function. Whereas if it was using iCloud (or Dropbox)it would likely still work. 
If you are not fussed about syncing your entry to another device I'd definitely recommend this app. 
But if, like me, you want control of your own sync data I'd be wary. It's a real shame, hopefully the developers will relent and restore iCloud and Dropbox support.

Update: I hate having to moan about this app, I loved the original version, but this version is so unreliable, lost some of my entries after the sync service became unavailable. Have just got Apple to refund me for the Mac desktop version, I shall keep the iOS version for now in the hope they relent and add Dropbox and iCloud syncing back. But have gone back to the old version. The Dropbox syncing is more reliable and doesn't require you to accept terms and conditions that force you to sign away your rights to your own content.",,,,,,,,,2022-05-05T12:54:47,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1328960844,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/79735917?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=79735917

Here Is Why...,"Any app of reasonable size and capability will eventually build their own back-end/sync service. Relying on a third-party for that introduces a lot of restrictions and risks. Just in the past year, both Dropbox and Facebook shut down major sync services.

Furthermore, maintaining multiple sync options is a huge code maintenance problem. Sync is among the most complex endeavors a dev team will undertake, and it is usually simplest when you control the back-end. 

I have zero concern about the integrity and safety of their back-end vs. iCloud or Dropbox. No one is immune to cloud storage challenges and security threats.

This is a fantastic update and it's well-worth the money. Software this good across iOS/Mac is becoming quite rare.

Original Day One was wonderful and was well developed and maintained, but was missing a few key features.

Now we have Day One 2.0, which addresses the requests for multiple journals and multiple photos, it seems to have been at the expense of sacrificing iCloud/Dropbox sync. 

Like many others, I feel a little uncomfortable that all of our entries are now synced via their own servers, but I do trust that there will be viable reasons for this.

The new app is clean, functional, beautiful and a pleasure to use. The upgrade is definiteLy years in the making however I do think that the pricing is a little much, even at 50% off.  More so for the desktop version.  I knew I'd pay as it is an app I use on an almost daily basis, but even still, I was a little sore when I saw the price and I can see folk not bothering once it returns to full price.

Also, it is still missing a few features - the ability to lock journals individually would be a good (and I feel an important) feature.

The ability to hide journals from the general interface would also be handy. 

I am hoping that new updates and features will be available faster than the previous version, especially considering the cost that even long term loyal users have paid with this upgrade.

The new version is a fantastic piece of journaling software, and I haven't been tempted to try another app.  There are still a few things that need ironing out and it is missing what I feel are a few key features, and the loss of iCloud and Dropbox sync is a biggie, so I would recommend sticking it out with version 1 for now unless multiple journals and photos is so,etching you cannot wait to use.

2016-02-06T04:35:03,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0,WRT,5,No More iCloud/Dropbox Sync - Unfortunate,"The app works. That's not the issue.

I've been using Day One for many years. I've loved the additions they've made and gladly purchased Day One 2 but unfortunately, that's where I'll stop. I'd love to actually use the app but Bloom's decision to drop iCloud and Dropbox sync may cost them in the long run.

I'd like to think the purpose of Day One Sync is to better integrate with other third party services like IFTTT. It may also be true that their sync is indeed, more reliable than say iCloud. However, I've never had a single problem syncing with Apple and that's where I am dismayed by their decision.

Day One says it maybe upwards of six months before their private-key encryption system goes online. In the meantime, some of their employees can access your journal data. Read the FAQ.

I agree that if you want your most private thoughts to stay private, don't put them in the cloud. But for those random ramblings that are still your own, Day One is asking us to be patient and give them data for the promise that it will be safeguarded until they update. That's a large gap of time!

I do hope they reconsider but even if they do decide to enable iCloud and Dropbox sync support again, they may not be able to implement that for some time. Their decision to kill iCloud and Dropbox sync isn't puzzling, it's just business. But it also means we customers have choices too, like not buying the Mac app.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1328529622,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486603?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486603
2016-02-06T04:08:30,1044867788,Day One Journal: Private Diary,us,en,2.0,zax_myth,3,I hope it gets better...,"The Good: better iPad Pro experience than Day One (1?). Three stars for at least making that experience better.

The Bad: Other than iPad Pro, no other experiences are actually improved in any meaningful way for me. Also, Day One 2? Really? I thought that was a a joke in the blog post announcing it but now I actually have to see that icon on my iOS devices: ""Day One 2"". There really isn't anything new here that I want to use: Multiple Journals? No. Map view? No. Custom Reminders? No. Multi-Editor Windows on Mac? Maybe.

I paid for the upgrade for two reasons. 1) to support the team that built a great v1 app that I've been using since it launched and 2) because I can't imagine paying the full price they're planning to charge - maybe someday.

I know Bloom says they worked on this for two years but it really doesn't show. Maybe all that work went into building out sync services (that apparently nobody outside of Bloom wants) but there is currently no new value. I hope there is someday but I'm pretty doubtful. I'll keep using it for a while but it won't be as hard to walk away from using than Day One (1?) was.

If you're enjoying Day One (1?), don't care about the new features, and don't feel obliged to support the team then save your money.

Sorry, but it's just not worth it - and I'm sad to say that. I really hope it gets better. :-(",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1328519035,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486602?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486602

Rare that I have no complaints with a big refresh to a beloved app I've used for years! I bought the Mac app, imported my journal into it, then synced it to their server and downloaded *those* entries to this iOS app, a process which took literally less than five minutes with my huge journal, which is amazing. I guess given that people trust services they've used a while, I can understand why some are mad that iCloud & Dropbox are not supported in this new version (a clearly stated fact in the long announcement, by the way -- do at least a little research outside the App Store before you drop your money, if you care that much, c'mon people) but those folks must never have used an app with native syncing. OmniFocus is a great example. In my experience native syncing is more stable and faster than third-party solutions because the developer controls the API and they know exactly how to support their own apps' data -- beats me why anybody would prefer a one-size-fits-all third-party solution. Especially iCloud, which works great with Apple apps, but with other apps, is kind of a dumpster fire. You see the parallel.

Severely disappointed by the removal of third-party sync options. Day One is supposed to contain my most private information, and I'm supposed to just trust it to their web service? With no way for me to pay to make sure it gets maintained, or that my privacy is kept safe? What am I supposed to do when they inevitably shut down the service, or it gets broken into? With iCloud sync (which, BTW, worked great in the old app) I at least had a fallback; it even seems the Export feature of the new app can't export in full fidelity.

The new app also seems to be a big step back in usability and simplicity. There are buttons everywhere, all of which are tiny, hard-to-press, and hard to know what's going to happen. I had no desire to have multiple journals, but now I have to deal with that everywhere. The editor is now full of tiny mystery-meat navigation, too.

So now they want $19.99 for a OSX update even though it's only been  a few weeks since I purchased / paid for their previous version.
I reached out to them to ask if this was an oversight or if they offered a code to discount those how just purchased their app. 
I didn't ask for a free update, and actually shared that I would pay the $4.99 MORE for the iOS version.
Their response was to tell me to contact Apple to ask for a refund!?!??!
Is it me or is this developer abusing those who have shown support for them.

I could present a positive review of the apps, but can not support greedy group of people or developers who think it's ok to abuse their customer base like this.

Within my first email message I shared that even Parallel offered a discount to those who had just purchased their prior software version going back 45 days.

And their response it to contact Apple???!?!!!?

To great extent I can see the benefits of much of the OS, but it really is sad that you can no longer sync to Apple iCloud and you only get small images to look at, when often a memory should allow for a larger view. 

Basically, I wish that it had the option to sync with a company that spends millions in cloud security, as opposed to an app developer who does not, and therefore I  feel that ,my personal info is soooo much less secure on their cloud service, and also the old feature allowing you to highlight images and then see them full screen if you desired is also lost to the new version.

 For as much money as this is I hope they can make ICLOUD SYNC AND LARGER IMAGE VIEWS  possible in later versions.

The ""entries nearby"" feature is genius. Multiple journals and colors is excellent, though I never felt the need for more than one.

I know that there's always the risk of missing features when apps are rebuilt from the ground up, so I assume that there will be many solid updates in Day One 2's future. The biggest feature I'm missing is the ""random day"" widget from Day One Classic. It was great to pull down and look back on previous days... Because isn't that the point of Day One? Making memories and thoughts (the most important aspect of journaling) easy to record and recall? The current implementation is effectively worthless. When you create an entry, your location can be add automatically anyway, so I see no reason to have a quick way to check-in.

Many people comment on the removal of iCloud and Dropbox sync. Though I do understand their worries (Day One sync is much newer than the other services), I don't mind the change. 

Among features I'd like to see added:

- It's time for real prompts. Prompts aren't just a ""Grid Diary"" thing. They remove one less barrier when it comes to actually using your app: figuring out what to write. Prompts provide easy pathways to more engaging entries (not just ""today I went to work and ____ happened""). New/shuffled prompts could also make opening your app closer to the front of user's minds, making it exciting to find out what you could be asked to write about each day.

- Flashback. You can sort of do this through search, but there really needs to be a simple way to see milestones (this day/week/month a year ago).

- Shared journals. Oh my word. This would be amazing.

Overall, a good update. Not a great one. Worth the money right now?

It's become by far one of my favorite and most recommended apps on my iPhone. I know of many people who journal now because of this app. One of the best features of the app has always been seamless syncing between my many devices, both iOS and Mac. In Day One 2 however they have removed iCloud Sync and effectively killed this app. I agree with other reviewers who have stated they do not trust a third party with their journal data over Apple's iCloud. Not to mention the very real possibility of them charging you for their sync service in the future. If you are going to make an app for iPhone with any type of sync capabilities, it MUST support iCloud as one of the sync options, or it's dead on arrival. No matter how great the feature set, and Day One 2 seems to have some nice new features, if it doesn't support iCloud, it doesn't work 100% on your iPhone. Period!

I could keep using the old version, but it's just a matter of time before they will have to drop support for that one. Beside, I'm an early adopter and using old outdated stuff doesn't appeal to me at all.

People are complaining about price, but no one hasn't taken away the original. I don't mind paying for quality apps. (perhaps the Mac version is too steep after the promo is over.)

Negative: lots of little usability problems.

Touch targets are small, which is odd from the company that made its original app have two enormous, wonderful buttons to start a new entry. Those are still around, but then you get tiny ones that feel so crammed. 

I use markdown when I write, and being able to swipe the added buttons above the keyboard was easier in v1 than a small markdown button. And even when you press it they removed the buttons for < and > to move the cursor.

When reviewing, not editing, posts, the spacing/white space was nicer, and photos would fill the width in v1. It looked like a nice website. Now (I'm using iPad mini) they are small, and tapping takes you to a full-sized view which is obscured by a box that hangs off the bottom of screen with more info. In v1 it was also easier to go from full screen pictures to scrolling through photos.

Leaving the interface issues, my biggest issue so far is sync. If you drop other services you need a reliable alternative and my first impressions are not encouraging. First day or so I'd import from v1 then all my posts would vanish. Did that a few times then quit trying. Then got it to work, went about setting up a new journal (a nice new feature), and then it duplicates most of the posts I moved to the new journal. Not all, just some of them. I thought duplication was one reason they mentioned they wanted sync done in house?

At this point with any other app, I'd move on. Having used day one for years, they have some built up credit. They iterated and updated v1 for a good while making it better and better. I have no reason to think they won't do the same. But I am worried about the flashy stuff being the focus over the highly refined usability I seem to have taken for granted from v1. And it takes a while to trust a sync service with such precious data after a troublesome start.",,,,,,,,,2022-02-22T03:00:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1044867788/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1327962070,https://appfollow.io/app/1637/review/9486682?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565766?review_id=9486682

When I bought the original versions( I was happy with the purchase. Not so with this update. I feel like an ATM. Their justification for the high price is: ""we worked for two years on this."" Seriously, that's their attitude. It's all about them, customer not so much. 

Only sync option is untested, unknown, and (for most of 2/4/16 AM) down. Not acceptable.

Only 10 journals? Really? Something tells me, were gonna get ""nickel'd and dime'd"" to death. Could be the end of Dayone for me. 

Why can't I start a new entry, while on a closed entry? Why do I have to go back to the timeline and then have it open the same window I just left? How is that an improvement? (Hint: it's not.)

I long ago tired of the soft colors, shades on shades design. Enough already. It's hard on the eyes. There is something bizarre about the layout, and design. I can't put my finger on it. I will say this: it's better than most. 

The import of previous version post imported easily. I'm not happy about the app assuming what is or is not a dupe. Let me see them, thank you. Support says the app looks for conflicted entries. O.K. I'm

Day One is absolutely the best app available in the woefully inadequate corner of journaling apps. I've thoroughly enjoyed using the original version (now called Day One Classic, and pulled from the App Store) for a long time. But just because it's the best app in a really bad field doesn't mean it deserves a 5 star rating. It still has issues. Issues I'm sorry to see the developer ignored when publishing the latest version.

Version 2.0 was touted as a major upgrade. It isn't. Improvements include the ability to use multiple photos per entry‚Äîa cataclysmic oversight in the original allowed only one photo per entry‚Äîand multiple journals (nice, but not earth-shattering).

Features still missing: the ability to import Twitter and Facebook feeds, services we use essentially as proxy journals. This is another oversight from the original version that should‚Äîand easily could‚Äîhave been added in v2.0.

Features removed: the ability to sync with Dropbox. This functionality was removed in favor of a proprietary sync solution. Don't get me wrong; Day One Sync works well. But it seems counterintuitive to force users into a proprietary storage/sync solution.

I'll continue to use Day One 2 on my iPhone and iPad.

I did this because the app only offers syncing from Day One, there is no iCloud version. While I love Day One, I do not trust my journal data to be properly secured via Day One sync. I only trust it to iCloud. 

Now this saddens me since Day One 2 has some great new features, the developers did a wonderful job with it. But I will not use Day One Sync in place of iCloud. I simply don‚Äôt trust a third party - even the developers of the app - with my journal data. This is my personal quibble, your mileage may vary. If Day One 2 had offered iCloud syncing I would have given it a five star rating, but for now I must give it only three stars. 

This is a bummer of a review to write since I really like Day One 2. But I just cannot bring myself to trust anyone but Apple with my private journal data. Sorry, that‚Äôs just the way it is.

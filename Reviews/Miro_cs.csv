When it works, I want to scream the app’s praises from the rooftops, but despite using a brand new IPad Pro, multiple times per day I lose so much of my hard work to sync issues and connection losses. At least once or twice per session, of which I might have 10-15 in a day, as little as inserting an image or editing a line of text in the app will trigger an interruption telling me that Miro is gong to spend the next 30 seconds trying to recover from a sync issue. There is no telling what might set it off. To my dismay, and more recently, complete frustration, it never does. Each time, I then have to close and relaunch the app with my fingers crossed and held breath, wondering how much of my work has been lost this time as I open a board to see that all of my writing, careful element alignment, etc from the last 5-15 minutes has been completely undone. I’ve been baring with this for months now and I’ve reached my personal limit. 

I simply can’t trust this app to function as advertised, nor can I recommend this app to others on this platform as long as this continues. 

I genuinely hope that this gets fixed so that I can update this review and celebrate what otherwise makes this app great.",,,,,,,,,2024-01-25T12:34:48,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1180074773/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10611268501,https://appfollow.io/app/17389/review/238759648?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565765?review_id=238759648

I was wrong about that, but here’s where it gets worse: every time a student made an account to join the whiteboard, the company charged my card WITHOUT ever asking my approval to pay or even notifying me that I’d be charged, until I was suddenly emailed a bill for $1700!

It’s also just not a great product: I ended up making about five of these whiteboards, but couldn’t use them in real time because the app was too laggy when multiple students joined it. I am currently waiting to hear from their billing dept. if they will cancel the accounts and not charge me this absurd sum.  Absolute insanity that their system would allow this.",,,2023-10-31T18:00:00,143:09:24,"Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

In so many ways, it’s the perfect “blank slate” but powerful tool that can be adapted for so many uses. It’s no doubt had a positive impact on the culture of my company as it enables more open, collaborative work. 

Yet, performance seems to be getting increasingly worse over time. Many times per day (8-10?), the app freezes while it reloads the server for 30 seconds, which typically results in me losing minutes of work at a time. This is akin to using software decades ago where you would lose your work because you forgot to save, which is much worse than an app simply freezing and frankly unacceptable in 2023. It leads to stress and errors as I try to attempt to recreate the work of the previous 5, 10, 15 minutes.

Miro, please fix the reliability of your app so it can remain the incredible and vital tool that it should be.",,,2023-08-28T09:48:08,70:34:27,"Hi there!

Whenever I am told to wait while it reconnects, it never works, so I lose the last few minutes of work whenever it happens. It especially seems to happen when copy and pasting or duplicating something as simple as a sticky note.

I don’t know what is going on, my internet connection is fine for everything else, but for Miro it is apparently too unstable to make text changes on a board.

Miro is great on my desktop computer, but the connection issues are extremely problematic.

On top of the connection issues, the weird way they have set up keyboard shortcuts makes it very clumsy to use. The iPad standard is CMD+C/V for copy and paste - but if you want to copy and paste objects on a board you have to use Control+C/V. Right clicking on a sticky note shows the shortcut as CMD, but it is definitely control if you try and use the actual shortcuts.

Whatever is happening when performing duplications, copy and paste, etc seems to make the app lag really hard. I have an M1 iPad, so I can’t believe it is a hardware limitation.

Really disappointing. Having used Miro for years at this point, I’m considering finding an alternative platform to move to.",,,2023-05-11T11:08:34,44:27:17,"Hi there!

Too bad I was disappointed. The fact that the app isn’t usable offline is the direct reason it’s useless to me. I don’t understand why you constantly have to work online, while you could also make a syncable app. I’m on the road and traveling a lot, often without much internet. It just doesn’t work.

Also the very complicated photo ‘upload’ function turns out to be just too cumbersome. 

Smaller bugs and missing features like text justification make it seem like the app is still in development. And that’s ok if this is the case, but it makes the app not usable for me for now.

After update, sidebar is continuously loading forever. Since I have no way to contact on the website unless I purchase the product, so I have no way to send you the bug. I’ve tried the email but you email just out of order. So, if you want to improve your product, you better have feedback or bug report for both free and paid. Otherwise this situation might happen in the future and you will lose your customer. Right now I’m moving to Figma caz miro is very hard to send report or communicate. Also, I did take a look at the community, people also face the same problem but seems like miro support just ignore it. Glad this happen before decided to choose whether it’s the right tool for me or not. It’s a good tools folks but here me out.

When I use the maind map, I am very uncomfortable with the fact that when I add elements of the second, third and subsequent orders, there is a dependence of the arrangement of elements on each other. That is, I click on a number to reveal all the hidden elements, if there are many, then the elements of the previous order move apart on the working board. And when I collapse the elements back, the elements of the previous order do not go back into place. And it gets that when hiding most of the elements, there is a huge amount of free space on the board. 

Xmind's competitors use a return of elements to their original position after hiding sub-elements. This is very convenient.

In terms of diagramming, colours, it’s really good. 

 What is infuriating is that you always need to be connected to the internet to continue working! If you download content and for whatever reason, you don’t have temporary access to the internet, MIRO wipes the menu and tools and your access to the board.

As I write this, Miro has an outage (May 5th for reference), and although all the boards I have locally are up to date, and a few of them are personal (i.e. no sharing), I can’t access them.

But this happens not only with outages. If you are in the UK and you are starting to commute back to work again, you probably find yourself with an iPad on your lap, doing what should be enjoyable strategic work. But no, every time there’s a tunnel, or the train is going through some lovely country side, the menu and tools disssapear and you can not use MIRO… even though all the data is downloaded. It’s asinine decision making from the management and product owners at MIRO and in the long term it’s going to lose them customers. 

Great… but the flaws make it not fit for purpose.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1180074773/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=8639024017,https://appfollow.io/app/17389/review/157872622?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565765?review_id=157872622

There were limitations to the mind map template like only being able to have the child nodes come from the side or the top, but not both. Other then that, although basic, it was usable.

Now the bugs are coming out of the woodwork. I just spent an hour doing a mind map for a book I just finished and the app crashed. When I opened the app back up my mind map had been completely trashed. New child nodes created, sub child nodes had switched child notes. 

There’s formatting problems/limitations, glitches in the spacing, there’s no consistence with the usage (some functions work then not work), and the free versions (the paid subscriptions are just ridiculously priced) export is none existent.

For a free app, I think Miro is doing a great job. However, the one thing that I hope gets fixed in the upcoming months is platform optimization. Miro was designed for a web browser so it’s no surprise that it’s a little… laggy on an iPad or iPhone. For example, whenever I open my project it will usually lag really bad. I have to zoom out and let everything load for 15-30 seconds before everything becomes smooth again. I use an app called Procreate to create big high resolution illustrations and those never lag when I open the project, so I think Miro might just have an issue with allocating RAM or something…",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1180074773/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=8145224813,https://appfollow.io/app/17389/review/157872485?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565765?review_id=157872485

Load times take a while, the interface is packed, and there are not many gestures or quick access to some of the most commonly used functions apart from searching for them on the side. I very much like the app, it’s already pretty minimalist for a program, but it’s a different situation if you put it into the context of the rest of the iPad apps that I use, which makes it so that I don’t really use it that often.

There are many premade maps for getting started.
You can print or export pages or preset sized options. You can customize the colors and text.  

Creating a map of stickie notes on a wall can be annoying and harder to edit or they fall off eventually. 
I love that you can zoom out and create a huge map with different colors and options. Linking ideas with arrows or connections is much easier than in other apps I’ve tried.

Looking at the other reviews this bug has already been present for a long time, why doesn’t it get fixed?",,,2020-06-21T19:17:32,231:57:00,"Hi there!

Thank you for asking, and we're so sorry for the delay!

Yes, you are correct, this bug has present for a while unfortunately and stems from the _limitations of the WebView engine_ within the iOS.

Our app uses WebView to render the visuals, and one of the rules related to the memory management is that the rendering process is not allowed to use more than **25% of RAM** memory of the device. After this mark, the app gets limited, and it stops loading properly without giving any error messages or crashes. This is why the toolbars can disappear and re-appear occasionally and the performance may slow down substantially.

As a **workaround** we can suggest trying the following:

- to close all unnecessary background applications before using Miro - this should better the performance,
- to work on boards that are _smaller_ in size - this should lighten the load of the app on the system.

I hope this helps! If there is anything else we can help you with - please let us know.

Best,

what i wish this app could fix:
-please. let. me. draw. again. this used to be a 5-star rating before it bugged out :(( i rlly wanna change it back and use this beautiful app like i did before, but i can’t! pleaseeee fix this bug as soon as you can or else my friend and i are going to switch to another app, as we can’t just give up on the webtoon comp because of this, tho this app was really the best one out there
-there seems to be a problem when i type on my iPad, as i can’t highlight things? not sure if that is intended, but it bothers me a lot
-when you use a stickie, the font size keeps changing— can there be a mode or something where the stickie size changes instead of the size? and can there be more fonts?
-i use an apple pencil and put my palm/hand down on the screen a lot. this causes a lot of random dots to appear, and i’m wondering if there could be a way to prevent that?
-eraser function: the eraser erases your entire stroke, which annoys me a lot, especially when i’m trying to draw something to get my point across

if u got this far, thank u :) this is just a mobile problem(but on my computer i can’t sign in through my google acc when i use the miro app), so try this app out! i really liked it before it bugged, and who knows? maybe it won’t bug for u :)",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1180074773/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=5880585126,https://appfollow.io/app/17389/review/157872754?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565765?review_id=157872754

A few improvements would take it all the way:

1. It often opens to a blank screen and won’t load until I force close the app.
2. TWO-FINGER TAP TO UNDO PLEASE. This is a big enough deal to lose a star, it absolutely kills my working flow every time I have to hunt down the undo button, and it’s a staple gesture for this kind of app.
3. Video chat is a complete mess, I got stuck in a full screen video that I couldn’t close when I tried it.
4. It doesn’t take advantage of the gesture shortcuts on the keyboard in iPadOS, which makes text editing more difficult than it should be.

Thank you for the feedback provided. We're really sorry you're facing this technical misbehaviour with Miro!

Could you please give this another go and try the following:

-

Restart the app/device, if there is no sign of improving, please, try to reinstall the app;

-

Check your _Internet connection_ or switch to a faster network or _device_.

If none of the options help and the issue persists, could you please contact us via support@miro.com and describe in what _case_ exactly our service doesn't operate as expected? Perhaps there any patterns you noticed? Any additional information would be helpful (screenshots, board URL etc.).

Could you please specify what device and app version do you use? The issue may be connected to the outdated version of the app. Could you please try installing the newest one and check if the problem persists?

We also suggest working on iOS version starting from 9 or higher (preferably 13).

Thanks for reaching out and addressing your case!
​
Since Miro relies on the vision of a seamless cloud solution for _online_ collaboration, the tool's _offline_ mode is currently not on our radar. In terms of feature development, the offline alternative is extremely resource-consuming and, since it doesn't meet our strategy at this point, I'm afraid there are no immediate plans to implement it.

With this in mind, we completely understand how being able to load your boards wherever you go no matter the Internet connection would make your personal workflow much more reliable.

To this end, we have some new functionality in our backlog that would help you view the last synced version of your boards _offline_. It's not on our roadmap, but rest assured we'll let you know if it goes live.

As a temporary workaround, feel free to export your boards beforehand and view the content as a saved _PDF_ or _image_, depending on your plan.

Hope this clarifies the case! Let us know if there's anything we should elaborate on here - we'll be more than happy to help.

I’m a Math teacher and this app / software is awesome for allowing students to save whiteboards, get help after-hours (on one’s own time or in real-time), and to log in remotely to join a class. We airplay mirror from an iPad that gets passed around the room and students who are home sick can still log in through their phones / computers to join the class... they can also save the board for studying later. I can save copies of boards for other classes as well. The online app can run on Chromebooks too. Very cool!

My only wish is for portrait mode support in the mobile app since larger smartphone screens are just big enough to use in that orientation.

Excited for an iPad specific app. 

I’ve tried a lot of whiteboards and this is one of the best (speed, fluid recording of the stylus, ease of interface, ability to download boards as pdf, good hotkeys, multi-platform).",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:59,,,,,1,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1180074773/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=1941290646,https://appfollow.io/app/17389/review/157872720?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565765?review_id=157872720

I've used the web version which is feature rich - honestly it has too much on the screen and the menus don't close and context menus don't change by context, drop down menus are messy and difficult to retract.  The context help conflicts with the menus and isn't easily dismissible so getting to work is filled with popups and distractions.

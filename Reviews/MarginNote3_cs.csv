There are many reasons this application should be your go to document reader. The solution for reading, note taking and possibly having mind maps or flash cards across many documents and connecting them all into one document is good. 

The reason I did not give this app five star: iCloud sync is problematic. I have multiple devices and sometimes certain documents just wont sync across devices, they just get deleted on the iCloud folder but remain locally on one device (the one that tries to sync it to iCloud.) Sync across devices is critical.

And it also gather all the highlighted notes in a place, which makes it super easy to organise your notes, search for your notes or even to review and study.

I’ve started using it for flashcards recently, it’s again a bit difficult to manually set them up usefully. And I’d love a bit more features for these.

Guess what - they have an “English’ guide which uses screenshots from Chinese version of the app. Lol what????

If they could invest some time in providing excellent documentation+screenshots in English in the guide, I’m sure the users won’t face an insurmountable learning curve. Heck, they can even collaborate with some YouTuber to create a basic to advanced tutorial series covering all functionalities of the app. It’s as if the developers just want to cater to Chinese users, and don’t care about others. Don’t believe me? Just search for ‘Marginnote 3 tutorials on YouTube and filter for this years results. You’ll lucky to find even one video in English, while there are abundant in Chinese language. This has been brought up so many times in their official subreddit, but they don’t seem to care.

TLDR- A full-featured app with unnecessarily steep learning curve, only because they can’t invest in creating good tutorials/guides in English language.

There are a number of texts I’ve used that text selection doesn’t work (particularly titles) and I have to select it as an image, but then I can’t search for it later because it’s an image.

The method I have developed works exactly like I always wanted it with Margin Note 3 and offered more that I didn't even know I needed or wanted. 

I love that the notes highlighted link between the mindmap and the document, unlike notability, adobe, and Evernote. 
Organizing and editing notes are much more manageable, unlike my previous method of color-coding different sources and then cutting and pasting them into pages or google Docs. 
It's a significant improvement over Zotero for finding my citations again and quickly checking my page numbers. 
I appreciate the extensive storage for mind maps and documents--it makes it very convenient for referencing previous work or research. 
In addition, I like that I can export my notes to a document to continue my editing once I get organized and then export my paper back into MN3 to highlight and further rearrange my own words. 

However, there are a few things that make me crazy. In order of importance (to me):

1. I do not like the highlighter colors offered—at all. There are not enough to choose from, and they are the same lame colors offered at Walmart, which I never buy IRL because I find the colors distracting and ugly. 

I realize this may seem insignificant to some. Still, for those who connect deeply with colors and resonate with the process of color-coding for visual connections—this is an annoying limitation. I would love to select my highlighters from a color picker at best or, at a minimum, have another 20 colors to choose from with more muted tones and shades. 

2. The (+) sign for expanding the branches is minuscule (and translucent!)— even when I zoom in, it's difficult for me to see the sign to highlight it and open the branches. . That goes for the one in the upper right corner of the framework. The small circled one at the bottom of the trIt's a critical part of the UX, and I have no idea why you make it so difficult to see. 

3. The dashed line under the emphasis bubbles is too bold when highlighted to emphasize the document. In addition, I sometimes cannot read the text underneath because of all the bubbles around each word (why?) and because the dashes are so thick and obstructive. Why not eliminate the bubbles and have a finely dotted line instead?

4. When I go to the notes format and select only one branch to export to a document, it always exports allllllll of my notes, which means I have to go back and sometimes delete dozens of pages of notes from the document I imported them into. Does that make sense? I have this problem; even when I select focus mode for the branch and select only those notes then export--it still sends everything from the mindmap. 

Lastly, I have never once left a review for any purchase. The fact that I have taken the time to do this is a testament to how almost perfect this program is for me; therefore, it was worth noting these few suggestions for improvement. I have screenshots of my issues for further explanation if it is helpful.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-01T14:30:23,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=9445798302,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157733933?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157733933

If the MN3 developers would come out with a few good instructional videos and a digital user manual it would make things so much easier than digging in blindly to figure out how the app works.,,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=9144072269,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157872541?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157872541
2022-10-02T11:33:35,1348317163,MarginNote 3,at,en,3.7.19,de.gozar,5,Great App with just a few downsides,"I got the app for university, as I need to have some kind of visual summary to get my learned stuff sorted. So the main feature i get Marginnote for, was the mindmap. It was never that easy to go through your lectures and create a mindmap at the same time. With the possibility to open more PDFs at the same time, I am even able to reasearch in some technical literature at the same time. So if you are searching for a way to effectively and time-savingly create summaries - Marginnote is the way to go.

I personally have found two downsides:
- You can‘t create a typical „note“, or like a notebook (like in Goodnotes or Notability e.g.), so if I want to create like a handwritten note, like i am creating them throughout my uni-day, I have to use another app, and then later on export it to marginnote , which causes a little more work, but maybe the creators are working on it or I just couldn‘t find the feature yet. (lol)
- Number two has to be the colour theme for me. Me, personally, I love to work with some kind of darkmode activated - There is a way to do it in marginnote, but the downsides concern the PDFs. If the darkmode is activated, the PDFs are shown in negative, which I personally can not work with, as true colours are essential for my learning.

But overall, Marginnote3 is a great app for iPad users (I don‘t know anything about the Mac workflow) and I am looking forward to the next updates.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:59,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=9143239273,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157872688?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157872688

Yes, it is complex and the interface is sometimes unintuitive, but stick with it and you will be rewarded. The only way you will succeed is to use and keep using the program. Start small with your projects and build on them. The user guide is to be honest, not all that helpful - it certainly does not hold your hand as you explore the ramifications of a new project. 

What do I use this for? A knowledge resource for stewarding in a historic house. Each room is linked to other rooms and contains objects and paintings. Images on screen can hold text or links to long form documents. Each node can be hidden or displayed in a tree fashion with the main node and child nodes. As you find more data on a historic person, links to that data can be made.  You can go 'down the rabbit hole' as much as you please, adding more links. These links can be collapsed to keep the project from getting cluttered and yet expanded as required by clicking on 'action' symbols. 

Could it be improved?
Yes:
Allow custom label colours
Use contrasting document link '>' colours (black is difficult to see on a dark blue background)
Document links are visible in Tree branch style, but not in Framework branch style

In summary, a vital part of my workflow. You have to follow the path that it sets for you and that path is frequently not clear. More options would be helpful, but perseverance should save the day.

If you try to use it on a second device (as one does with these types of apps), it prompts you to pay another $50. 
Despite the features it boasts, it is absolutely not worth purchasing because cannot utilize said features effectively on an iPad/tablet alone (not appropriate for making use of mapping and flashcards, uploading docs/PDFs, etc); nor can you use it effectively on laptop/desktop alone (no point to a reader interface with Apple Pencil there). The purchase should be synced, but it’s not. This should have been made transparent prior to purchase. I would not have started with MarginNote had I known it would require me to spend at least $100 to properly use. No other note taking apps I’ve used has required multiple purchases like this.  

Additionally, I have contacted the developer multiple times about this issue to see if there was a chance I was missing something, and they have refused to respond.

Today I went down the local Starbucks and start trying to make sense of some complicated eBooks, and everybody’s keep turning as I smoothly annotate parts of the eBook(s), research parts of it I’m not sure about by following links within the book, and all the while effortlessly keep modifying my knowledge tree, adding parts of the book as and per information I’m needing to clarify.

I’ve seen people with similar problems to mine, at The Nero coffee shop I caught this older gentleman who was pouring over a book intensely annotating a piece of paper like he was trying to expunge knowledge out of it with his pencil and a slip of paper; sort of like what MarginNote 3 does and excels; I demonstrated how I did the same for my digital books and I watched this gentleman’s mouth just gaped every time I did something on my texts.  May not seem like much to the mum on her facebook sitting next to him, but to him you could see it was life changing.

Then I went to the Starbucks and got an older Chinese gentleman with a huge philosophy book that you could see he was really interested in and was trying similarly to find out how he could clarify his understanding of it.  Again I started doing my thing with my eBook and wiped out my iPad again, scrolling up and down the often confusing and at first appearing contradictory points but with MarginNote add easily clarity by adding it to meaningful trees of understanding I am building and easily attaching more to.

So what can you say?  I’m even using on the King George’s Bible which has got a lot of references that are key themes throughout the whole book which if you just read chapter-to-chapter you won’t appreciate or capture.

I also find the eBook reader to be very friendly, I like the window overlay that appears when you click a link; rather than just jumps straight to the link’s destination.  Also I love the way in Document mode, when you actually read the way you move is in page-flip mode, to use Kindle terminology; but when you click a link to another part the way you move around the overlay window is in scrolling mode; and then you can then choose to ‘get off’ or stay where you are.

My only critical feedback/ features I wish it had were as follows:
1. I wish that I could view pdf docs as 2 page side by side scrolling, some docs that are formatted that way such as one page with rich text followed by a chart or figure on the following page could be more easily digested with the ability to feature both pages on screen together imho!

2. I think the ‘find’ tool could be refined. Particularly if I have one document selected, I would love it if I could search for words or phrases just within that document, as opposed to only being able to generate a search result from ALL documents, which can take a longer time to load, and produce more options than necessary to sift through if you are wanting to refine your results to just one specific document.

I highly recommend to give it a try. You will get a generous 14-day full-fledged no kidding access to try it out, which is more than your average developer nowadays offers. ===== Before MarginNote, I’ve tried e.g.: Pdf expert, which is good for annotations and filling forms, great as file manager and reader but editing tools are rather basic, no mapping, no seriou excerpt support, no *revolution*. Speaking of which, I was VERY curious 9and for about one day very excited) about Liquid text: it does catch your eye with its fancy ways and temporarily enchants with great tutorials and novelty ways. But when you stop kidding around and want to start doing serious business, that’s when it starts to go downhill. C’mon, if they consider a REDO button as a feature that needs to be requested and pleaded for (can you imagine any editing tool without a redo, anyone?!) and they cannot handle exports of hand-written comments (only comments in text boxes will export) and all those little bugs and basic features still not implemented and they DARE to ask for fat amount of subscribe fee, thank you very much. All in all, Liquid text is the kind of hype that wants you to believe it is revolutionary but when it comes to USEFULNESS, you realize you have to twiddle with it ALL THE TIME to get things right, instead of actually doing what you should: reading, revising, being productive. GoodNotes are not a replacement for this either, although it is a great accompaniment tool having its own place in my workflow. ====== MarginNote3 does take some getting used to and exploring on one’s own (they’re not strong in the instruction manual area, heavily criticized for lack of support) but contrary to this, the app is functioning very well and does what it should, I had no reliability issues so far, and as seen from forum and past updates, it is steadily being worked upon.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:57,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=8762870353,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157871269?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157871269

2022-04-27T08:31:00,1348317163,MarginNote 3,hk,en,3.7.17,CBTHU,4,Extremely great,"This app is very good, you can manage all your pdf or other acceptable formats here. 
It has a function called mind-map, which you highlight on the notes, it will help you to input into mind map. [if you cannot find this function, you probably haven’t enable in the settings]

But here has some mistakes or disadvantages:
1. If you highlight too much and input them into your mind map, once you wan to move them all together, the app may crash [ I use iPad Air 4] 

2. When you enable dark mode, the background and words will transform into the inverted color [ i.e. black to white ]. But the problem is: the app turns the fig. on the notes as well [ e.g. I study astronomy on this app. When I enable dark mode, the universe pictures turns white from black…….]

But overall, this app is extremely good for those have thousands of millions notes to cope with!!!!!!!

2022-03-30T15:50:15,1348317163,MarginNote 3,pk,en,3.7.17,Samwyyz,2,"Has potential, but not quite there at all","On the surface Margin note appears to be the best option out there for making mind maps, taking notes, and excerpts from multiple sources such as PDFs and websites. However, once you get familiar with MarginNote, it’s limitations make it a disappointing, unintuitive and clunky experience making you constantly wish if only it was better. Margin note lacks fluidity and it’s not a true mind mapping software. It is more of an excerpt collection tool for making flash cards. Flash cards may be useful for rote memorisation but not everyone uses flash cards as there are better non linear methods of learning and organising notes. All maps and excerpts follow a linear tree structure which makes for a very rigid format to collect thoughts and make connections. It makes it very difficult for reading and reviewing notes because of linear hierarchy, inability to emphasise or give importance to certain nodes, and overall poor legibility with all nodes following a linear flow. The tree structures created by margin note are not optimal for reading and referencing back to notes or finding relevant information quickly. Legibility is reduced without being able to control the spacing, position or sizing of nodes. Arranging excerpts without making them child nodes or forcing them to become part of the rigid linear tree structure keeps them at risk of being automatically rearranged without their position being saved. No ability to make fluid arrangement’s or connections. No ability to align or distribute nodes. Once a child map node becomes part of a tree structure or group it can’t be resized. Once in focus mode of a child map, no button to unfocus, have to instead go back to the main mind map and reopen the child map again. That is a basic usability violation. There is no ability to go back and forth through history of child maps which were opened. Instead the only back button is to go back to the document browser which one rarely needs to do. Making links from inside one child map to another is a difficult multi step process. The browser used to add webpages is terrible. It lacks tabs, history or bookmarking. The workflow with the browser forces one to have to import one webpage at a time and once it’s added it can no longer be navigated. It’s just a plain document. To go to other links on the same website, one will have to go back to manage and import another page. This is a frustrating experience. The whole advantage of using a web search engine to study subjects while researching across multiple tabs becomes impossible to do. Websites should be able to be opened and navigated freely, with multiple tabs, without having to import them as documents one page at a time. The research tool is awkward, no way to directly search new topics, and one has to first select excerpts and research the whole text node. The research tool and web browser both can not search text within the page. Notes taken with a pencil are difficult to group and select. Pencil Notes and excerpt nodes can’t be selected at the same time. One has to first select the pencil notes separately and then bind them to a node. What if the pencil note is on top of an excerpt? Then you have to first move the excerpt and the select pencil notes. A very unintuitive and frustrating experience. Grouping nodes restructures and repositions all nodes and all positions are lost. Difficult creating child maps, Can’t convert text nodes into child maps. The pencil tool lacks smoothing options, lacks ability to make shapes, and feels very basic. Highlighting tool is terrible, it’s not highlighting the actual text/words, but drawing a stroke floating on top. If you move the excerpt the highlights don’t move with it. Ridiculous. The highlight tool also is only layering a colour on top which reduces legibility instead of using a blend mode. Syncing to iCloud or backing up feels clunky and syncing shows no status or progress indicator, so one is never certain if notes have been synced. Pasting or importing images from external sources is difficult and there is no ability to resize the images. Limited colour coding options. Can’t define custom colors. Limiting text writing and editing features. No support for different heading styles or presets. No cross platform support, makes you tied to the apple platform. Sadly the list goes on. Most of the time spent using margin note is spent working around its limitations. This review is intentionally critical because Margin note has the potential to be the best app in the market for its purpose, only to fall short because of poor implementation in some critical areas. In the areas marginnote does do well it is truelly brilliant. It seems there is little movement in trying to improve Margin note, and updates introducing improvements to such problems are non existent.

HOWEVER, my current biggest issue that truly ruins my time is the arrangement of the folders. 
I’m an organised person and label everything accordingly. I have folders for my different course and each course has a different set of readings for the different weeks. 
Tell me why listing alphabetically from 0-9 is alright but the moment you add a 10 it becomes 0, 1, 10, 2, 3… etc. It’s absolutely distracting when it doesn’t need to be. What would even be the logic with that? If there is an individual with such a peculiar manner of sequencing items they should include a “custom” way of arranging the folders because truly that is not how typical alphabetical orders should be presented. 
I would think it’s a simple fix but who know.

Toss in the fact that some great updates to the app exist as hacked together “extensions” by the developers instead of being baked in and you have an app that will amaze you up front, begin to frustrate you as you seriously use it, and eventually make you regret your decision as the lock in grows. 

With all that said, it’s likely the most feature rich option in the space. If the notes you’re making are something you intend to utilize the rest of your life…. Run. Run away now. This is a black box with seemingly no real intention of changing or improving anytime soon.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-01T14:30:24,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=8095337075,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157734031?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157734031

I’ve tried both PDF and EPUB files and it works perfect for both of them. For epub version, it's able to show almost the same format as iBooks but with a variety of ways of adding notes.

The best function I love is creating a group of cards. When I read something useful, I can select the texts and add it to cards. It’s like grouping the same type of knowledge from different sources automatically for your later review. When certain type of knowledge is needed, I can just go through the cards, and it’ll show the original texts and comments that’s been made at the  time I read it. Then everything just flushed back!

The text is not even handwritten. It’s typed. Free apps on my phone read and convert those texts correctly even from a photo clicked of the file. This expensive app has failed to do that. A simple word like ‘Displaced’ is converted into ‘ Oispliiced’ and ‘fracture’ to ‘Froicture’. I tried to use the Autocorrect/auto fix issue which obviously doesn’t work.

I could do a lot of freehand annotations on pdfs and books as well as organize research projects really well. It is by far, the best program I have ever used for research. 

I’ve used this to take notes during class, research my own personal interests, plan out essays, etc. This app is suprisingly flexible.

I don’t really have a lot of big critiques of this app, but I don’t think I can give it 5 stars since there are a lot of little things I really wish were able to do in the app. However, these things are annoying, but they don’t hurt the quality of the app like crazy.

I guess my biggest critique is that I don’t think the tutorials are very detailed which is very frustrating when trying to figure out how to do something. Whatever team writes the tutorials and how to use guides I wish was almost overly detailed.

I have tried with Notability and there you can remove all the annotations freely. I wish this app can update with this feature. 

I took the trial two weeks ago and fell in love with this app. It revolutionize my study and completely changed my way of learning! I bought it yesterday and plan to become a heavy user down the road. 

However, today I noticed that it already takes 2GB of my storage even though I only read less than 30 books. I am sure the books are all relatively small (average < 10 mb), but the documents generated by the app seem to take too much space. I would appreciate it if some optimization can be performed to boost its performances.

I mean there are so features in the app and so many gestures which are built in to make the task of comprehending and mind mapping so much easier. There is a bit of learning curve here, but the app is worth every penny. You need to visit YouTube to find what creators have found in this app. 
I had just purchased this app for mind mapping as i was using liquid text for it. That’s a different type of full freely movable excerpts type of a app. But it has its limitations. That’s why i moved to MN3. 
MN3 has built in OCR and can efficiently apply dark mode even on pdfs. That’s what i found so awesome on the app. With the latest update of apple pencil kit, the app is become even more user friendly and its so much fun to read mindmap and learn on this app. 
If you are wondering if you need to have a different app for pdf annotation or a note taking app, BE AMAZED as this app has that feature too. They have a few types of pages. 
The review cards are a bit of a let down as its very rigid. I feel they too need an update.

2021-03-09T02:24:47,1348317163,MarginNote 3,us,en,3.7.4,simonsterj,4,Almost perfect,"First of all, I can’t believe how content I was in paying for this product, and how actively I tell my friends about marginnote.  

Here are 3 things that would make it perfect for me.  

1. Addition of Markdown 
 - There’s an entire user segment of notetakers that are used to, and rely on .md format, and an entire notetaking app market that specializes in markdown. Markdown would instantly open marginnote’s innovative mindmapping concept to the technical .md-comfortable crowd. Programmers are also super friendly to markdown, and may consider MN3 if .md was available.  
Adjusting font styles using the keyboard UI is not efficient enough, so I don’t even bother using it.  

2. Mindmap Object Orientation 
 - The concept of mindmapping derives its value from the fact that it offers a visual-spatial element to the user, thus adding a new dimension to acquisition, and finally retention. I see the fact that ”child objects” can only orient to the right to be completely antithetical to mind-mapping. You must allow child-objects to orient upwards, downwards, to the left - this would let users experience the full psychological benefits of concept mapping.   

3. Export Options. 
 - The final selling point of MN3, for me, was that you allowed .pdf and .anki export options. Many products these days don’t pay attention to the fact that users don’t want to be constrained to one platform. It scares us. It gives us anxiety that our notes will be forever locked. This prevented me from using many other note apps. Although the preferred note format I’d like is .txt, so that it’s easily portable, I see how .txt can be difficult with the kinds of objects you work with. However, if you guys can make it possible, you may have a stronger argument for extending the lifetime value of your customers. (hint: maybe you guys can start with .md!)  

4. Feature Integration with .epub and Others. 
 - .pdf, .epub, etc., offer the ability to highlight text, add table of contents, bookmarks, etc. Is MN3 trying to be THE BEST e-reader? I don’t think so. It might be fair to acknowledge that users are doing reading elsewhere, highlighting on their kindle, or desktop, and then coming onto MN3 for more organization and notetaking. Therefore, developing stronger integration with basic text-based features would add lots more value.  

5. Related to #4^, MN3’s e-reader is lacking. The bookmark function doesn’t add value. The reading UX is lacking. It doesn’t seem like you guys have prioritized that much. It would be nice to see it get some more attention.  

Overall, I like this product a lot and would be happy to see it succeed. Please feel free to contact me and I’d be happy to provide any more feedback.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-01T14:30:24,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=7082694041,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157733999?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157733999

for example, in study mode, on the top left corner there are two icons that open up a menu. if I tap the icon with bullet points, then tap the “. . .” icon, both menus will be opened, with the “. . .” menu will be on top of the first menu. 

Again, in study mode, sometimes when I’m adding a new node for a diagram, the node editting window opens up over the pdf window, so if I want to copy multiple things from the pdf and paste them in the node, I have to copy them, then edit the node, then go back to the pdf, copy another thing, then open up the node window again... etc. the option to minimize the node editting window is usually not there, but it does show up sometimes at random. 

there’s another bug related to using bluetooth keyboards.
the keyboard layout covers the font options when editting a node. 

and many more bugs! they should stop milking people by releasing new editions. Instead, they should work on the bugs and on making the app more intuitive to use.

UPDATE: 
Why does it keep adding copies of the pdf files that I’m editing but with different suffixes instead of saving the changes to the same file?

I simply cannot afford to invest that much work to be lost due to the developer not getting basic file management squared away. 

If I were the reader, I’d be thinking “sure, probably user error”. I’ve been using Margin Note since it was Margin Note 2. Since them they cannot get iCloud and their proprietary file system to sync correctly, so it dumps files.

Beyond that, the UI is so complex that many of the advanced, very helpful features are buried. For example, did you know you can mirror image a branch elsewhere, even another canvas? When you change it in one place, the mirror image reflects that change. 

Good luck finding this feature on your own, without support or help documentation. Everything has been patched and bolted on.
My recommendation is MN tear apart the app, rebuild from the beginning with a UI and cloud expert.

Best of luck to MN.

The thing that I prefer with MarginNote are it’s ability to handle absolutely huge volumes of notes and documents. It has an efficiency in its mind mapping that isn’t present in other tools. It isn’t really a mind map that it creates but a hierarchical and visual organization and this suits research well. 

With the latest update it has pen support and with the new child mind maps the scale of research possibilities is nearly endless.

I miss the free form of traditional mind mapping but I realize that with large texts a free form mind map gets crowded very quickly. MarginNote keeps things organized very well. 

A couple of things that I would like that MarginNote is a bit weak with are: better referencing to the source document on export of notes. Even if I had to fill out that source info manually for each document I’d be happy. Bonus if it could export the citation in any of the usual formats. 

The links are hard to see and to keep track of. It’d be nice to be able to color them and make them thicker. 

Finally I’d like a way to link my own notes to a document location rather than having to make an excerpt to do that. 

These are minor issues and I use the app obsessively as it is. 

The company seems responsive on their forums and almost every feature request is listened to even if we have to wait for it.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-01T14:30:24,,,,,1,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6986299501,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157733991?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157733991

The interface is a little frustrating and clunky sometimes, with top level mind maps overlapping each other, it’s a little weird to get items to go where you want, you can’t add hand written notes in the little pop up note window without making it full screen, so you can’t read the document at the same time...

I thing it is such a great app that has powerful features and combines all that you would normally need 3 + apps for into 1 app and all those features are integrated .
For improvement :

Exporting options 

One o the biggest wonders of MarginNote is retaining the link to where you got each except from and from the exact book and place. The problem is when exporting it is hard to retain these links ins a practical way.cit would be great if you could automatically generate footnotes or endnote with references for each of the excepts using a super text (eg ^1)right after the excel and before the respective reference so it can be easier to locate the references.

A bibliography section that can be automatically generstied based on the info from the text would also be of great use and another powerful feature to add on 

Of course for practicality the best export option would be being able to export the outline(WITH THE ENDNOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY ) INTO A WORD DOCUMENT 

IMAGES IN MINDMAP 
the sizing can be weird especially when it is a detailed image and I want it all to be in one excerpt but them argue note makes the image really small in the mind map 
Please in operation the option to resize the notes in the mind map especially for images 

Why is there no way to insert images into a document (I do not mean as a document page but as an annotation 

The mind map 

I wish thaT the mind map would support other views and themes like many other mind map apps offer views like timeline, storyboard etc. 

The flash cards 
I wish you would improve the automatically generated flash cards so that the emphasized text can automatically become a clozed card that has a full in the blank 

A scratch pad would be a great integration in the testing yourself flash card mode.like the one that is in Anki so you can write down the answer to your question before the answer appears on the cards 

And the algorithm for revisions could be made customizable so that we can change for each deck the reviews needed kind of like the Anki separate deck options 

A option to do only cards of a certain color (based on the color of the card in the mind map 

I don’t particularly find the recall mode that helpful maybe it would be more helpful if there recall mode was made automatic in the flash cards so that the high lit red areas would automatically be covered 

Margin note has such great potential I can’t wait to see further development

One last general tip would be to incorporate a user guide that goes through all the features of the app quickly  rather than making them read a guide to get the idea or watch short videos an guide that actively guides you through the app and asks to to press certain buttons and then popups explain the feature would be a greater benefit than the guide book which can be used later a reference to specific features. 

Also if you could show more examples of how people can use the app for niche fields like medicine, or research etc in maybe a example maps type of way that would do wonders to inspire users on how to use the app .

Thank you to the wonderful team at margin note for such a functional powerful app!",,,,,,,,,2024-02-22T03:18:13,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6777883319,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/244701930?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=244701930

However I cannot drag the second text box to make a mind map and I can’t find how to do that. All in all I am sure it is a good program if you are familiar with it but not if you are new to it.

While their UI is much prettier and cleaner. They have just a really poor mind map experience. What I like about MarginNote in contrast with LiquidText is just how much more organized it is. In LiquidText almost any accidental touch on the mindmap ruins it. Also it's a web of what you put where ever you wish to. In MarginNote however, you have an app that organizes the mindmap into a chart with direct branches that you do not decide how to be put. It organizes the look and keeps it which is just so amazing. It just makes me more and more relaxed to be in the app vs LiquidText. And also in the LiquidText you cannot have book-free studies to just have bookmarks.

But the research tool is horribly made. There is no link to the OS dictionary. Or any good offline dictionary. The UI seems horrible and has so many problems. It is just the worst part of any app I've seen. Hope that gets fixed someday.

And as far as the price comes, I think it's much cheaper than LiquidText which is awesome.",,,2020-12-23T06:21:56,206:49:26,"Thank you for your support and encouragement.

I have 2,000-3,000 documents in the app. I think it is about 2,800 now. The app has become very slow despite having lots of available memory on my iPad. 

This has become a major problem as there is rather rudimentary control over what syncs to the device and what doesn't. The Settings, Cloud Sync panel, would ideally solve this issue. However, it runs slowly and lacks any way to select multiple documents to either download or remove from the local device. There is a way to delete all documents entirely, but there does not appear to be a way to delete all the documents only from the device (and leaving them on icloud).

If this was a modern game, it looks like Mario Brothers 8bit, but UI & UX wise.. it’s pick up & play - just LOTS of features. 

If learning the app.. do watch:

 “Paperless X - MarginNote3”  on YouTube

Roxy does an excellent breakdown, she will have up and running in no time- it’s how I learned in under 10-15min. She has lots of videos so start with the basic and work your way from there.

MarginNote3 one of it’s KILLER FEATURES: 
Allows us to save a video from our photo gallery then go within that video and create clips for reference! That alone destroys all the players I name below in this note/study app market (which I’ve purchased and used extensively during my searching for a note/study app era):

Notability, Goodnotes 5, Flexcil, Agenda, Neebo, PDF Expert, Liquid Text, Noteshelf.. etc. 

Notion is the King as far as database and storing data (I use daily) 

but.. MarginNote3 is the King of “Rich Interactive Learning” meaning engaged learning not passive! Way more engaging than Notability in my opinion.

DEAR DEV,
Some options I would LOVE for MarginNote3 to address for smoother workflow:

1) CREATE BLANK PDF
From within MN3. I have no idea why this feature is missing, my only reason for a 4 star. I take lots of online video without PDF resources. I have no way of creating a blank pdf in MM3. So at the moment  I have to... 

• Open PDF Expert (3rd Party App) 
• From PDF Expert, create a blank pdf
• Export blank PDF to iCloud
• Then import back to MN3

 This is way too much. Study/Work flow disruptor!

2) APPLE PENCIL DOUBLE TAP FOR FINGER READER ICON
When I’m in my PDF and creating references via the drag out box, please allow me to double tap Apple Pencil and it the icon goes to right to the finger reader icon, so I can just scroll through my PDF. 

I have to keep remembering to tap finger icon, which I forget, therefore I’m constantly creating accidental references. 

3) FLOATING REFERENCE BUG?:
In settings, inside research option, I chose “float” so that my reference is not bundled with my prior reference, I created a moment prior. 

It does indeed float - no problem here, however,  the floating reference keeps appearing INSIDE the picture frame square. I don’t want that, how do stop the picture frame square from enveloping around my reference? 

Thank you. I do look to see what you have in store. Very impressive app.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-01T14:30:27,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6689640534,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157734195?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157734195

As another reviewer said though, it’s not the easiest thing to understand (largely due to its sheer possibilities) so I would recommend watching a few YouTube videos at the start.

The app is a great app when research for keywords in academic papers and books in pdf. I wanted to be able to have all my research in one place and load all in one workspace. This app has this feature in the pro version. I have currently imported around 600 PDFs and it works. The search feature is really great and works without any issues and has OCR capabilities which is amazing as I have a small number of scanned books published before the digital age. 

It has many great features for creating flash cards and mind maps and the beauty of linking back to the text in pdf at a click of a button.

The painstaking task is importing the PDFs into the app for which I use OneDrive. Selecting all the books and importing to the whole folder always causes an error which is the handler error. To be fair this is an Apple IOS issue and not the apps fault from the research I have done.

It would be great if the handler error regarding the connection to OneDrive is fixed by Apple soon. In the meantime try uploading around 3 PDFs at a time max. 

I have found this App very good and value for money and is a perfect companion for students, research students, writers, authors, lawyers and even work place where you are dealing with lots of files. There are other apps on the market which I have used but this one actually works apart from the import feature error. It hasn’t crashed on me once which is much much more stable than other similar apps. Adobe pdf acrobat is good for searching a keyword but does not provide the clipping features, highlighting text and creating mind maps for each book and able to add tags for easy research. It even copies diagrams into the mindmap. However I have found that sometimes it only keeps the text in the pdf and upon clicking the text you can view the graph in the actual document. This could be of course be due to the pdf conversion issue. More testing to be done.

I am always wondering the max number of PDFs I can import before the app crashes but so far 600 PDFs is good. I hope that around 2000 pdf capacity would work.

I have given it a rating of 4 as it would be great to have:
1. Windows 10 version.
2. An extension for Firefox for example to allow the articles or text from webpages to be automatically uploaded to the app.

Overall a great app and worth the small price for the functions it provides.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:57,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6523322964,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157871525?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157871525

What I don’t like is the lack of documentation, it’s almost learning by yourself despite the “tutorial” concept map they have, files and folder management lacks of structure and flexibility, but it does the job. The one thing that bothers me the most is the reduced color palette for excerpts, there is a full color pallette for fonts but not for excerpt boxes, why.
Despite the limitations I just mentioned, the app is so powerful with excerpts creation and several review modes that I strongly recommend it, just take your time trying it and discovering its strengths and you’ll be well served.

Instead of mind map or perhaps added to the mind map I would like something similar to the flash cards simply to organize my information( that's what I'm doing now). It should be easier to make cards and add things to them, to switch from back to front of card. Instead of just cards for study why not have cards just to find important information. I find that more intuitive then the mind map. I love adding pictures and notes directly to the cards. Then i click on the headers and the information is there simply by scrolling down. If they had a button to bring up the cards, And quickly switch to the main text or mind map and back it would be an improvement. All of these things are probably there already but the learning curve makes it hard to use. Overall not bad but needs to be more intuitive.

I am really surprised by how the app is able to easily handle having many documents open and run a mind map on the side and still remain so responsive. I will say the initial learning hump or the program was definitely more than with most other note programs but I think it was worth it.

I would like to recommend some changes though, especially in terms of the apps flashcard capabilities. I would like to see some quick edit functionality which would be really helpful for when I realise I’ve really poorly structured the occlusions. Also being able to tweak the learning algorithm would be really cool, I currently don’t love that when I find something hard, the earliest repeat is 2h when I’m more accustomed to 5 minutes. Addition some more format options to the cards would also be really cool, such as hide all vs hide one options. And finally for flashcards, it would be better if for images we were able to set the resolution (for example, if it’s a very detailed and large diagram that can’t be broken up into smaller pieces, sometimes the text becomes illegible). Also, sometimes the occlusions can be a bit big, like if I write “inflammation of the choroid plexus (choroiditis)” and try to occlude the term choroiditis sometimes the occlusions will cover up the brackets as well, (especially the closing bracket), which can make some cards difficult to understand what I was asking myself for. 

For the note taking/text editing options I think there are also some small improvements that could be made. I think it would be nice if there were more cutting tools other than the square selected and lasso tool (ie something like a polygonal selection tool). And maybe a shape tool too. 

But these are all minor gripes when you realise all this program has to offer.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:58,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=6396796961,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157871744?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157871744

 3. I liked the layout of Marginnote 2 better. In marginnote 3 the ""outline"" is in a floating window.  The outline window should occupy the screen alone as in Marginnote 2. Navigation in Marginnote 3 is sometimes difficult.

 2. Just as it works with video files, it could work with audio files (MP3) and .doc files.  The audio and video files should recognize the subtitles srt as an element for annotation.

 3. In marginote 2 it was possible to add an additional audio note without opening the notes menu.  This way of working was better for reading and taking notes more fluidly and without interruption.  It would be perfect if the audio notes could later be transcribed into text.

 4. Could sync with other clouds (Google Drive and One drive).

A lot has changed, but a lot hasn’t.  Each time a new version comes out, I wonder if I want to spend the money and research what else is out there.  Maybe I find something interesting and try it, or maybe I don’t, but I always come back.  There’s just nothing else that does what MN does.

A lot of the other reviews cover why I look elsewhere from time to time... the app can be inexplicably weird or counter-intuitive or just a little bit off sometimes.  I can often get it to do what I need, but not without frustration.  Often times, where it fails are in standard UX practices that almost every other app follows, but MN chooses to ignore those and do things its own way.

I’m not a student, so I’m not making flash cards or anything like that, but I do a lot of research.  I really like the ability to add multiple documents to one project.  I have one with at least a couple of dozen PDFs and epubs, not small ones either, and MN doesn’t complain.  There are occasional sync issues, but I’ve gotten good at backing up and—knock on wood—haven’t lost anything yet.  I think if you’re only using it one system, that won’t be a factor.",,,2020-08-11T16:06:43,221:44:34,"Thank you for your support and encouragement.

Update 2: And the old bug of not storing your last location is back. Added to that - huge sync delay. Why? This used to be a good App. Now it hurts to use 😭

Update: Took them 1.5 months to solve a critical bug that made the App unusable- and the new version has new bugs (syncing is draining battery and will trigger a pop-up every minute). It is really a shame that it used to be good and now just gets worse. Not worth the money anymore. Hope they‘ll turn it around, but have doubts... :(
///
Has been a month now that App is unusable. Used it for hours every day despite it short comings. Guess have to move on. Pity :(

Update: Since last update App does not remember the last location of you document but jumps back to the beginning. Makes it unusable! Sadly there is no way to get my money back. 

It is a great app for casual use. The moment you work with text, gather substantial notes and just frequently use it the small bugs compound. 

Additionally the UX and thus UI got quite cluttered. They try to put everything into the App - which could be cool - but forget to adapt the design and interface. Most frustrating - there is no manual. Just some random tutorials that are not helping at all. 

Small things but they get annoying quickly. Seems like it is either a single developer without capacity to make it good but ambition to add more features or a company that just doesn’t care for quality and the users.

The only criticism I have is that the handwriting experience doesn’t feel nearly as smooth as it does in some other apps I’ve used. Writing in Notability is just lovely and smooth, and enables me to write neatly. I also don’t know if MN3 has algorithms that recognise when my palm is resting on the screen as I write because I seem to accidentally select things quite a bit.

2020-04-28T16:56:46,1348317163,MarginNote 3,it,en,3.6.7,PotusLotus,5,Love it for organising complex ideas,"Hi,

I love your app and just upgraded to the full version.
I have a couple of suggestions that can further enhance the usability of the app and the quality of interactions.
1) I find particularly useful the automatic addition of excerpt to mind maps. Then you need to reorganise them. The default action when you move one excerpt onto another is “become child”, which I find to be the right choice. 
However, if you want to “merge” the excerpts just added with a previous one, you need to perform 2 actions: first become child and then merge. It’d be great to use the multitouch feature of the iPad and make it possible in only one move. This is my idea on how to implement it: while moving the selected excerpt in the mind map with the Apple Pencil IF you touch the screen with also a finger the action automatically changes from “become child” to ""merge into"".
2) I often reorganise mind maps so I need to move multiple excerpts in a single time. Right now, I’ve only found a way to move one at a time. It’d be amazing if, after having selected the first excerpt in the mind map with the Apple Pencil, you could add a second touch of the screen with a finger and continue selecting multiple excerpts.

The multitouch feature I mention in both cases is the same and it is already available in iOS code, search on YouTube ""rearrange, organise iphone and iPad icons and apps in minutes rather than hours"" to see its application.
I’m sorry if they’ve already been developed in MarginNote and I’ve not found them.

I hope my explanation was clear enough. 
I’d really love to see them soon, please consider adding :-)
Thank you very much",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:58,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=5875972415,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157871791?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157871791

It took me a while to write a review because it sure have a bit of a learning curve. As a grad student, constantly consuming journal articles I find mind mapping the easiest way to make sense of articles, link like concepts and identifying inconsistencies/contradictions or gaps in knowledge. Plus, Mind mapping makes it easier to return to the articles I’ve read and identify information without needing to re-read an article. 

Minor bug - when I add notes to my excerpts, any time I type with underlined/bold/italics the app crashes. 

Request - I often highlight important text in an excerpt, is it possible for the highlight to also show up in the text selection?(I know I can use a box and it’ll show up. But I often emphasise and highlight the same text)

I enjoy the summarise feature, but is it possible for the summary to be an excerpt? Or to merge an excerpt into the summary text mode?

1. The outline
	It is good to see an note app that has a outline system, but the outline does not have a good structure. There is no bullet points, no signs or anything that can mark the different levels, or say indent. 

2. Mind map
	The reason I pay for this app, or maybe the reason for most of the users, is that, the mind map is really good, and it can be linked to the document. However, there may be a better structure of designing the mind map. There are too many blank spaces. After I zoom out, I can see nothing about the mind map. I need the full structure as well as the content of my mind map. The words are too small to see.

3. Font
	The number of fonts are too limited, I am not sure if this is because of the cost of the fonts, but anyway, I still need to mention it. I kind of get use to see my texts in “Times new roman”, and there is no font looks like it. I love “Times new roman”, please add it into the app. 
	After my personal complain, the font really has an issue that the font can only be changed in the settings but not in the content interface. So that you can never know what the font is like before you change the whole thing. I had to google all the fonts and choose one that I can accept. 

4. Linking the points
	It is useful to link different points, but I really do not need to see all the details that I have written again. May be better to make a setting of points linking, maybe add a note on the points or a summary. Sometimes I need to link a paragraph to a picture and the picture is so big that I forget which one is the important one when I review my mind map. 

5. Overall interface
	The themes are so so so ugly and are not eye-friendly. I spend hours on this app every single day, with my eye drop. The white, black, especially the green theme, either delete them or re-design please.  

Overall, there is no big issues of this app so I give a 4/5.

It can do a ton of stuff in the app, like pulling over images directly from google into the workspace inside the app itself, basic pdf reading and annotation, organized mind mapping and even gives you more option for students to study the material, which works really good.

However there are many little things that stop this app from being perfect.
- The overall looks of this app could definetly be better. It feels like there are a lot of things that makes it more complicated than it should be. But there are different tastes anyway.
- Sometimes you really feel limited by the app. Just the ability to draw on the workspace, to pull different parts of the mindmap to the place I want them to be and if you even had the ability to change text like in any other app (size, bold, italics, underline, ...)   would make the app seem much more limitless than limited.
- Even more little improvements can be made like: Even if you want to draw on a mindmap tile, first you need to add text on it. Why? Then, you can‘t even zoom in so you can write or draw more precisely... 
- The hotkeys are cool, but I think they make no sense in what keys are binded. Like why is Emphasize Mode not something like cmd+E?
- There could be done more with touch controls, like undo and redo by pressing with to fingers and three fingers.
- The workflow overall can be slow at times, so some improvements could be done there

Overall it‘s a great app, but it‘s not yet perfect at all.
Would be cool if you made this app better!

The Good:
Both apps allow excerpts from multiple documents, but MN3 has the added ability to display the data graphically via mind maps.
The Bad:
MN3 creates copies of my PDF source files and places them in its own folder. This is a waste of space since now I have two of everything.
The Ugly:
The user manual. *Wait!* What manual? The use documentation available online is for a much older version. MN3 comes with a manual disguised as a mind map. Cute concept, but all it has are silent videos that show “buttonology” which most users can figure out on their own.

It is always good to know a developer cares, and I truly believe this dev does care about their customers. I have tried all of the possible solutions suggested to fix the slow and unresponsive syncing between devices. The problem though still persists. To be frank I think iCloud sync is broken for me with the current version. Although I am happy to report that the Handoff feature does work, and it works flawlessly. So I am happy to rate again as 5 stars. I really could not be without MarginNote 3. It is such an important part of my workflow. I just hope the next major update improves the syncing through iCloud.

Original review:
I have used MarginNote for quite some time for marking up research material for my novel writing, and think that its feature set is beyond stunning. It currently stands head and shoulders above some of its rivals in this category of app in terms of its overall feature set, and suits my needs perfectly. However, and this is a really big however, the app has been driving me crazy for the past few months. One of my main criteria for any app is its ability to work seamlessly across multiple devices and platforms. In theory MarginNote has this functionality. In reality not so much any more.

Partial syncing of content from one device to others, with each version showing a different stage along the markup process and never seeming to update. Constant spinning wheels telling me notebooks are being downloaded but they never do. Missing documents on some machines. Fetching data messages which when even left over night never disappear.

I need to use this app on multiple devices because of how I work, but it just feels as if it doesn’t currently have my back. I know, from visiting the forums that I am not alone, that this is an issue the developer recognises and plans to improve in a future update. However, all I keep seeing are updates and tweaks to the interface and other features. Please, please, please get the core functionality sorted, and fast.

Hello, the previous OCR function is still free. This is a value-added feature launched in partnership with ABBYY and requires you to choose whether to pay for the project. The addition of OCR Pro has made it possible to extract, select, highlight and search the contents of the scanned PDF. It provides offline OCR and also provides more functions for networking OCR. Correction, etc., we are also working with ABBYY for the convenience of users.

For your suggestion: the reason why icloud is used is that synchronization is a function that requires very high technical indicators of the network disk, which is why there are few reliable cloud disks in China that can be used for synchronization. If the synchronization error is light, it cannot be accessed; if it is heavy, the data will be lost. Therefore, we have always been very cautious about the development of Compatible Synchronous cloud disk. Only when the reliability is ensured can it be pushed to the terminal. The SDK embedded in the Mac and IOS platforms can guarantee the reliability and compatibility of icloud synchronization. In the future, we will not forget to explore more synchronization solutions for users, but at present, we are still exploring more synchronization solutions It is recommended that icloud be used first for synchronization reliability (data security).

But if u don’t have a mac, your marginnote usage will be limited to only a small ipad. You will have to transfer and do ALL marginnote related work on ipad. Having to keep and organize all the files in an ipad, it will get troublesome when you got more files. 

Also, its file format and annotations is propriety and not in pdf format, making it hard to transfer and edit elsewhere for the annotations. This means you are stuck with marginnote, where if your laptop is windows, you can’t annotate there at all (unless you are willing to have separate file for the same document, where annotations on windows desktop can’t be synced with those on ipad). You have to cumbersomely transfer everything manually to your ipad.

So you need a mac, or you need a real big ipad screen with good processing speed, (cause when the mindmap becomes large, small screen = hard to edit and organize) (and when files accumulate, due to work all having to be done on ipad, it WILL LAG a lot).

Edited Review : tnq MN team for ur reply n concern abt ur customer suggestions,needs..
I’m requesting one more feature...for medical students like me it wil useful very much in during making notes from different source of pdfs..that is give a option to change the fonts size n styles of letters from mindnotes excerpts cells itself without going back to settings... one more request is ..give a option during converting mindmap excerpts into pdfs for printing/saving as copy i mean i.e give a choice to how it wil adjust total mindmap excerpts into one page or two or more according to total data in tat or arrangement rather than at presently its concise al of it into one page so it’s difficult to get clarity while giving it to print,need to zooming it every time read the saved copy..
Once again tnq n hope these feature we can see in next update..
Suggested to so many of my medical school Frnd’s ..recently some them purchased n liked MN3 in after seeing it in my ipadpro..
It saves time for me in reading n helps in remembering easily ,takes less time in revisions ...

First of all I love the note taking funcitons, all works as advertised, lovely.

Stuff I would like to see:
- Integration with DRM protected formats (adobe) to be able to take notes of applications that require licences. I would pay for it extra as a DLC

I don’t know if technically possible but if its a licensing cost, please make it available. I hate using very bad readers just to access content.

- Randomly tapping on the pen enters drawing / eraser mode when I just want to continue just highlighting (did not find a way to turn it off)
- No windows version :(
- I have an iPad Pro 3rd gen but even in focus mode when there are about 150 clippings / notes in mindmap mode the app needs a few seconds to render the notes... optimzation?",,,2020-01-10T02:19:22,18:10:43,"Hello, thank you for your detailed explanation of this proposal.

But it crashes. Occasionally at first, but is becoming pretty bad recently, and makes it almost unusable.

[Update]
Just realised the iCloud Drive does not work either. I have a bunch of documents annotated on one iPad, saved, closed and waited for a day, they still have shown up on my second iPad. Not sure if it is a problem with iCloud or MarginNote, but the user experience is really bad.

[Update2]
It crashes less now with the new update, but sometimes the highlighter will suddenly stop working with all the contextual menu options gone and only “copy” left.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-02T04:48:58,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=5149701280,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157872378?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157872378

There are a lot of ways to use the app. One way I use it is as a replacement for iThoughts and MindNode, as a mindmap app to get control over my thinking. It’s not as nice to edit the mindmap as it is in those other apps I mentioned, but it’s so amazing to be able to link directly to a highlight in a book, video or audio. You can backup all your ideas with evidence and quickly jump back and forth between different sources to help your ideas flow.

Aggressive and fairly innovative features are added, unfortunately with the compromise of many small bugs that often take a while to get fixed.

But the thing that makes the app miss one star is mainly that the user interface is in many cases not thought through enough. Not a dealbreaker but when you have to go through it many times a day, it becomes annoying eventually. They have a feedback system, but havn’t fixed these things years after I sent the feedback, multiple times.

2019-10-13T06:55:43,1348317163,MarginNote 3,us,en,3.5,DrJJWMac,1,Good options but needs functional and UI fixes,"I have been testing Margin Note to mark up assignments from university students. I see one major and a few minor issues.

* Margin Note flattens all of its annotations for exporting. Granted, it makes up for this serious failing by allowing the annotations to be exported in a separate OmniOutliner or mind map format. But, when one’s only goal is to markup and then review in a different app (e.g. DevonThink To Go), the loss of annotations is a failure. Also, Margin Note at least handles importing of annotations from PDFExpert properly.

* The sync with iCloud is inconsistent and remains unreliable. And iCloud is all we have.

* Importing only works at the root level, not in sub-folders.

* The fixed toolbar position at the top is cumbersome and restrictive (compared for example to PDFExpert with options for any side of the screen). The annotation menu seems to be sometimes here and sometimes there rather than being fixed in one place consistently. Finally, the choice of drawing colors seems to switch constantly depending on different cases rather than staying fixed at a set of favorites.

Overall, I am pleased with the options that Margin Note provides and the approach it takes. I especially like the options to tag notes. This allows me to use metrics such as #incorrect, #invalid, #sloppy, #improper, and others. I can then tally up the scores just by counting up and scoring using the tags. I have made only minimal use of the study mode and see no use behind using the research mode as yet.",,,,,,,,,2023-02-01T14:30:27,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=4939938731,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157734312?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157734312

1) handwritten notes in selections
     - the eraser tool is not accurate - it removes not only the strokes I’m erasing but also some strokes around that area
     - there is no way to undo/redo actions in such notes
     - when you select your handwriting (rectangular selection tool) you can accidentally move it outside of the note area and its hard to put it back or impossible at all.
     - there is a lug for a second when you switch between tools (between eraser and pen for example) - which annoys a lot
     - I think there should be at least 3 colors available for a quick switch between them, cause selecting the pen in order to switch a color adds up to a solid amount of time when using the app throughout a day
2) When you highlight math formulas - they are not recognized properly and get added to a mind-map converted to some gibberish stuff. Maybe when some of the text cannot be converted properly it better to automatically fallback to an image?

Update: The notes feature is simply not usable: eraser is not accurate and removes lots of handwriting around the actual eraser target, inking is lagging, some of the handwriting gets sporadically deleted, when a note is open and you change device orientation it becomes impossible to move somewhere cause its header goes outside of the viewport.
Apart from that the app crushes all the time :(

I would advice to start working on existing features fixes and polishing instead of delivering new features and multiplying amount of bugs...

Good that it automatically tries to assign a level in the hierarchy by table of contents. Following a strict tree hierarchy rather than free form bubbles allows collapsing big mindmaps (focussing on whats important). Also less reliance on proprietary software, because you can export into Word/Omnioutliner/Mindmapping. You can merge multiple cross-refs into one. Annotating videos is a new feature but already function a game changer with popularity if MIT OCW and other Youtube educational videos. PDF master files live separately from your “study” notebooks, which means no duplicating if you’re studying several subjects/areas from the same book or resource.
Areas of improvement would be better ink (e.g. Goodnotes) drag and drop files into document manager, Video controls inside the mindmapping interface. If i click on a video excerpt it starts playing, and i can edit the comments while watching, but no pause or rewind.

Any serious app hunter / note-taker: Note the changes that have taken place over time. These folks are serious about creating a seriously incredible app. In a word?

Awesome.

3rd Review

I raised another star for your efforts and increased clarity (still the best in the business bar none, and grateful for your engagement). 

But there is disparity between the functions of the app (as highlighted in the introductory video, for instance), and the actual sections, labels, titles, etc. in your app. (no doubt YOU know what you mean, but still unclear to this user). 

In other words, while the video highlights app capacity (all the app can do), there is no clear path from the app options on opening (‘Document’ ‘Study’ ‘Review.’) and these tools. So, while I would prefer Library (i.e. articles, etc.), Notes (mapped, assigned, linked, what have you), and Study (Flashcards, etc.), the point is that your labels don’t clearly link to your super-cool features. 

You are brilliant: But not all constructs order well linearly. Perhaps this app could use a (mind)map (for instance) of the app? A directory of sorts?

Lastly, blue notes categories and red ones too, but they are different? Probably just me, but confusing.

Thank you again.

 

2nd Review

I raised a star tonight for the quality of the app (the best in the business, by far). But currently lacks either a design that is simple enough that no training support (i.e., manual, videos), or the support to make use intuitive. Stay Tuned!

1st Review

 I intend to keep using this program, but dangit, who tests these apps? I am tired of apps that aren’t intuitive, and this one takes the cake.

Processing notes for product is essentially a linear process, from initial project idea, etc., to gathered resources, to note taking, to note assembly (per project as binder, and both in outline and mindmap form).

Yes, this app has all those tools. But the effort required to move pdf notes (which may or may not be recognized by the Study and Review stages of the app) through the linear progression above is frustrating, maddening, ahhh!!! The notes you take on your pdfs may make it to a card deck, but getting them from there into a map / outline along with other notes you took requires no less (it seems) than a magic carpet, lucky dice, and a cousin who happens to have designed the app.

Ahhhhh!

Stay tuned!!",,,,,,,,,2023-02-01T14:30:28,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/1348317163/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=3543853603,https://appfollow.io/app/12712/review/157734613?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/565776?review_id=157734613

Hopefully, developers will look at Flashcards issue as soon as possible else I regret to spend money on this app and migrating from LiquidText.

Flashcards problem: despite organizing and consolidating study material at one place, review process in flashcards is disappointing. First, once, I get a notification that I have this number of cards pending for spaced repetition and then after opening the review area, I need to search for a needle (due cards) in the ocean of flashcards. MarginNote 2 has this feature for not only an individual deck but also in combined deck for random review- those can be easily incorporated here. Second, flashcard itself has a problem of window size in landscape view of IPhone- its pathetic beyond imagination, customization of card window size will be greatly appreciated. Also in Cloze mode, external image incorporated in a card can not be covered/hidden to recall. Many of the above problems are exaggerated because of lack of a operative manual/ tutorial.

-pdf export chrashing in focus mode
-evernote export overwrites previous exports even if i choose not to do exactly that

Of particular value is the ability to change the outline level (and correspondingly the mind map level) of a particular highlighted section so that the outline and mind map show appropriate indents.

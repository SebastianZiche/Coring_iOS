It’s good to write as it’s good for your mental health, as according to therapists and psychologists. And my mental health is not the best, which I believe is extremely common in todays world. 

Since this app is on my phone and it has reminders, I’ve been writing everyday so far. Hopefully I can keep up.

Pros: 
-Typing is so much easier than writing. A lot of time I stop writing in my journal is because my hands gets tired.
-I can attach pictures or locations 
-Prompts are nice!

Cons:
-My only major con is the return button while writing. It’ll scroll up and i can’t see what I’m typing until it goes to the next line. Really annoying, please fix.

A concern is privacy as it’s on the phone but I honestly don’t have anything interesting if for some reason a hacker wants to read my journal haha; it’s more for improving myself. Still I prefer the privacy.

Would be great if it also offered you to save multiple templates, for instance if you had a set of questions you like to ask yourself. Better yet if you could say on Monday morning prompt me with ‘xyz’ and Monday night prompt me with ‘123’ … end of each week prompt me with this, end of each month prompt me with that, yearly prompts etc.

Lack of a search bar, attachment options outside of photos, video, and IN APP RECORDED audio (not any audio you can import from voice memos, for example) makes it hard to use. I wish I could link to notes I have taken, or voice memos I have recorded.

As an aspiring educator, I often record audio in conferences to take notes and better myself. I wish I could at least add a link to said audio recordings so when I look back on how far I’ve come I can listen and reinforce what I’ve learned.

The lack of search bar and titling/tagging is annoying. I would love to be able to filter by anything other than just photos/media in the future as my journal becomes filled out.

It’s extremely useful that you have everything visible as a card. I do appreciate it more than any other apps. It does few stuff but incredibly good. I have a suggestion, which would be incredibly useful to everybody.

 It would be great to insert tags visible as a sticky menu above and horizontal which is scrollable. Just to give you an idea, what Muse diary did. This is super useful to navigate, and it allows customers to organizing stuff but having tags visible.

So when the Journal app suddenly showed up on my phone, I opened it and it looked like exactly what I needed. I thought it was great that I could add pictures and videos in. This could allow my journaling to really advance and be so much more fun to look back on. Unfortunately, it just doesn’t work very well. As I mentioned, I like to use voice to text to Journal. I have physical limitations with my hands so it’s really the only way for me to Journal. Unfortunately it is just not smart. The most annoying thing, which really shouldn’t be a thing at all in 2024, is that the screen doesn’t scroll as I speak, so once I have more than a paragraph or two, I can’t see what is being typed anymore. I can scroll down, but it will scroll back up to the top for no reason and I just have to hope that when I’m done talking the text will be there. It’s so much fun to dictate my journal for five minutes just to find out that the app stopped listening again for no apparent reason about 30 seconds in and I didn’t notice it because the app makes it impossible to see the text that is being added as I dictate. Why put out software that isn’t finished? Just polish the code a bit. Have another set of eyes take a look.

-using the text to talk feature was very buggy, mess up a lot of words, and sometimes put them in this in the wrong order. 

-improvements need to be made to the lock feature of the Journal. There needs to be an option for a separate pin. That is not your iPhone entry pin similarly to guided access settings

- Needs more ways to organize the journal entries such as folders or individual note books in the app. After all people journal for various different reasons.

Another thing is, I take photos with my camera and add them to my iPhotos, but the journal only seems to let me add photos from my phone itself. What would be sooooooo amazing would be if I could easily attach the recent DSLR photos from my camera roll and then have it intelligently put them together with photos from my camera around that same time. And then could even suggest adding a location to those photos, as that is something I usually have to do manually. Feel like there’s a ton of potential in this app being a way to nicely Interface with your photos/exercises/phone calls/etc and reflect/organize them, some additional features would be great to have. Another annoyance is there’s no way to set default date to be the date of the activity. I am going back and writing about things from this week, each one I have to manually select to use the original date not todays date.

Edit: another very useful thing would be the ability to integrate with Apple health’s state of mind features: make a journal based off a recent state of mind entry, or be able to be prompted to do one after the other (maybe you can be prompted to do state of mind first in this app, then journal, and have it display together; or after you do it in the health app you can have it prompt you to do a journal entry, but that’s harder cause there are many different journal apps maybe they don’t want to explicitly plug this app there)",,,,,,,,,2024-02-13T03:50:39,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10897105138,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/232676009?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=232676009

Until it is available on iPadOS and macOS, until there is at least a Notes-like tagging and folder system, and most importantly until there is an option to batch export in some clean markdown format that guarantees we will retain control of our notes and be able to access them past the end of Journal or switching to another platform, I can’t recommend using it.

I had been so looking forward to this app being rolled out by Apple for iPhone. Finally something that can replace social media! Something that can recreate the original use of a photo sharing platform such as Instagram but without the notifications or the void that you seemingly must now enter in order to participate in it at all currently which I am personally not interested in. Ultimately, I do however miss having a tool in order to journal. However, there are multiple flaws that need to be ironed out in order for this app to be functional. First, practically, there is a glitch which prevents you from being able to write a journal entry (unless you wanted to write a few lines, which I usually wouldn't with journaling intention) by temporarily moving the page up and down. This is also extremely disorientating. Also, there is no option to use horizontal view. I can understand the reviews saying suggestions are off (I think they're cool) and the others asking for social aspect integration. Although, as a digital minimalist, I suggest social integration within reason, I think some kind of share option would be nice.",,,,,,,,,2024-02-13T06:22:07,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10867691835,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/242642462?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=242642462

I will continue to use Day One, but I’m going to use this along it.

I would like more control over what I include in the journal without the restrictions. Add things like workouts, meditations, and other apps that I would like to include as part of my daily reflection is clunky. This is relatively new, so with time I suspect it will improve, and I will be happy to give it five stars, hopefully sometime in the future. I’ve been using this now for a couple of weeks and one of the things that drives me crazy is that it keeps skipping to the end of my journal entry when I go and add something in some other part of the journal. Yes, you can put pictures in but you don’t have any control over where they’re placed they’re all at the top of the screen. And it shows the workouts but I’m not overly impressed. I plan to keep using this because I like to put down my thoughts, and it will be interesting to someday in the future reflect back on them. Apple developers whoever is working on this app please continue to look for ways to make it shine.

1) When you are back timing your journal, have the app intelligently suggest items from that day you are on ie bring up photos from that day. When you search photos it doesn’t even show what day the photo was from so it becomes a huge ordeal to back-journal.

2) Allow more customizations within the journal please! Custom templates would be awesome.

3) Allow multiple journals!!

(USA),2,"Buggy, feels weirdly rushed-out","…though I don’t know why you’d rush out a journaling app. Anyway, it still has pretty limited functionality—no tags, for example, or block quote formatting. Most problematically, the interface jumps around erratically when your entry extends past the initial screen space (i.e., when you have to scroll). It’s also very difficult to use the app for writing when you get to that point because there’s no “typewriter scrolling”: your text remains all the way at the bottom of your screen, rather than having a cushion added automatically. The prompts feel gimmicky, but they can be disabled, thankfully. And I like the ability to lock the app with Face ID.

I LOVED that Apple created a journal and thought it was going to be the perfect place to collect my thoughts. But, I don’t always journal my thoughts in perfect sequence as if I am writing an email. Furthermore, even with an email or with this review for instance, I’m able to easily go back and add anything I want to the text without any issues. I enjoy having the ability to jump around the page with my thoughts. Insert ^ a sentence or a word that comes to me later in a spot that makes sense for it. Sometimes, I like to copy & paste a paragraph or two of some advice I’ve found on a website and maybe even edit it just a bit to make it apply to me and my situation. It’s my own personal & private space to let loose and say whatever in the h#ll I want to myself. But this journal is making that dang near impossible!! I move the cursor to a particular location on the page and begin typing aimlessly, only to look up and see that midway through my first word,  the cursor has jumped down to the bottom of the page, making me lose my place and having to scroll and fix both spots. I can handle such a minor glitch if it only happened once a session every session. But, it does it over and over and over and over again!!! If I put my cursor in a particular spot on the page, I don’t need it moved back to a spot that I have repeatedly moved away from and can easily get back to on my own if I wanted to. I don’t have health issues, but I could literally feel my blood pressure skyrocket after the 15th time around for one log.

Typical of Apple, the app and user experience is beautiful. However, it lacks key features. For example, the ability to search and catalogue your own entries; functionality on Mac and iPad; the ability to add music of your choice; the ability to record the number of entries and perhaps a streak counter for the amount of consecutive days with an entry; as well as the ability to share or export an entry to other apps or contacts.

I love the simplicity of the app.  Not bloated with unnecessary features.

Love the color scheme and minimalistic aesthetic.

One tap access to read entries without going to another screen.

App is a secure and password protected. 

Cons:
Buggy. Screen jumps around once you reach the bottom.

No auto scroll. Hard to read and write once you reached the bottom of the screen. No space given between entry and keyboard settings. 

No option to remove recommendation feature. It’s annoying to see every time you enter the app.

Things others have said. Lacks organizing features to sort and compile entries. 
Folders. Calendars. Search bar. Something to easily access old entries other than scrolling. 

Not MacBook/Ipad compatible (yet).",,,,,,,,,2024-02-13T03:51:01,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10850425473,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/242622386?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=242622386

Also that would be cool too to later on search for the “yellow bookmark” And be able to see all yellow marked sections from different notes in one place. One note thing I find misssing: When I create a journal I like to note the time, so there should be an option to add the time when the journal was created next the date. There should be an option to add the current time within the journal on new entries f.e.: I start the journal at 10:10 am that should be after the date, but if I later on write different things then I should be able to start by setting a time for that as well while the main time 10:10 stays. It shouldn’t use the time when it was edited last!! I read other comments with all of them useful suggestions. So they’re legit too but for me these updates would be the most op.

Some information I was expecting to be prompted with and/or allowed to attach in an entry:
- State of Mind enteries
- Changes in Sleep trends
- Medications, Diet activity
- Hormonal cycles
- Other Health symptoms I've logged
- Weather conditions, especially significant events like large storms & pressure changes
- News articles saved & read
- Links I added to the Reading List
- Pre-recorded Voice Memos
- Links to Notes
- Links to Emails, Messages, Voicemail
- Reminders I completed & missed
- Events scheduled in Calendar
- Contacts added
- Screen Time
- Notifications I opened

It's possible some of these integrations are present but at the moment it is unclear.

Some other features I'd like to see:
- Manual tagging
- Grouping entries by date in a different view, possibly in columns
- Drag & Drop support for text, Voice Memos, Photos, Notes, Reminders, web links
- The ability to set goals in a separate section of the app and prompting on how my work towards those goals is going
- iPadOS and MacOS support

The way I log info about my day and thoughts is still being served better by general purpose document writing because of its versatility. Journal needs to plant deeper roots open more windows and give me more tools. It needs to double down on putting my data in one place and accepting data from Apple's own software. I don't want to screenshot everything or write it out by hand, and if I have to, I'll use use Notes or something 3rd-party.",,,,,,,,,2024-02-13T03:51:03,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10848628600,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/242622543?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=242622543

I’d had a lot of journals over the years but I could never stick with them. For some reason, this app puts it in a form that just works for me. 

Here is how I journal: Growing up, I always treated journaling as a journal prompt the way we would do it in grade school. So I would sit down to write about something, but instead of letting my thoughts flow, I would answer like a prompt if that makes any sense.  The way I journal is I ask myself a question. It could be a very simple question like how was your day or what’s on my mind right now and all I do is I take what pops up in my head and I transcribe that into the app. So I am literally transcribing my thoughts and what I have learned is that my thoughts flow and I’m able to process thoughts instead of just keep them up in my head and that’s how I use this journaling app. I hope that helps. ❤️

But when I opened the app I was disappointed. In reality, it has fewer options than the Notes app has. I think it’s a great concept but could be so much better. 

For starters, there is no easy way to format the text, as there is in notes. You have to do the infuriating double-tap, highlight, tap the arrow, tap “Format” and click italic/bold/underline instead. There is no option for bulleting or numbers for outlining as the Notes app has, and I use quite frequently. I would like to see a markup feature like there is in Photos and Notes. I feel like this feature should be a given with any journaling app. Having the option for different fonts would be phenomenal. I also think there should be an option to title entries with something other than just the date it was written. Folders you can label would also be great to organize different types of journaling. For example, I don’t just use a journal to write whatever is in my head; I keep separate journals for daily reflections, story writing ideas, prayers, devotionals, notes, and other such categories. I would like to be able to keep them separate instead of just one jumbled mess of dated entries on one page.

There are some bugs that need to be worked out with this app, as well. After typing a certain length down the page, I will be typing on a new line and then find the whole page quickly scrolling all the way up and down, every time the cursor automatically enters to the next line. It is extremely annoying and a rather unsatisfying typing experience. Also, I tried several times to add photos to my entries, but was only able to select them. The photos would not appear in the entry and would uncheck itself after going back to type in the journal. There is also no easy way to go back to the main screen except by choosing “done” at the top right. I feel like a back button would make more sense.

Also, would have given 3 stars, but I found out Journal is not available on iPad, which is a shame because I would have preferred to use it on there vs. my phone. Being able to have the journal app and use the scribble feature with the Apple Pencil would be a dream!

That being said, I do like the journaling suggestions and the lock feature so that the content can’t be seen by others. For now, I will stick with Good Notes to do my journaling. Hoping to see some improvement with Journal soon. This is something I could see myself using regularly if features were added and bugs were fixed!",,,,,,,,,2024-02-13T03:51:07,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10841993454,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/242622828?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=242622828

Please add the following:

- A way to undelete journal entries;
- Folders, so we can journal for different things (eg work, personal, etc)/Ability to group entries by weeks/months;
- A feature that helps/reminds you to follow-up on an entry;

What is the best thing that has happened this week?” And it’s about reflection and stuff.

2024-01-19T08:40:33,6447391597,Journal,gb,en,1.1,Elle!!!!!,3,Long way to go,"I wish in reviews it let you do paragraphs. Sorry it’s so hard fo read. So it’s ok but it really needs a lot of work and hoping the below may help get some features added. It’s very early days obviously but these are just a few things u feel are missing. I’m currently using it for the prompts, screenshotting my entries and adding as a photo into Zinnia or then printing the photo to add to my main paper journal. So ideas…. 1. Ability to change font. Colours, bold, italic * Discovered whilst trying to copy this in the app for the review you can select text and then choose format for very basic formatting. Bold, italic etc 🩷 emojis I guess for bit of colour 2. Able to write your own title and to choose the background colour. So it matches the ones promoted 3. Be able to filter by your own titles colour. I want to be able to have codes for different entries. Work, home, creative 4. Templates for entries. Even simple ones like a calendar. However tapes, shapes would all be good. 5. I want to be able to draw / colour in - one of the biggest things I do is keep a track of my mood I can’t do that here unless I write it in text form 6. I want to “shape” my photos, circle, rounded ages, heart - simple shapes but I want to be able to do that, place them where I want on the page 7. Tags, something that has been brilliant in notes and reminders 8. Printing 9. Missing connections to other apps - if you were sporty you might want to add in fitness entries 10. Needs to work across everything, not sure if it syncs with my IPad other reviews suggest it doesn’t. What it really needs is a lot of the functionality that has been put into notes and reminders At the moment it is only good for being prompted to write text, I really like this feature but if it could be more tailored to a person. For example I don’t listen to music I can’t and I’m constantly being asked about music. If when getting the app I was asked to pick five things I love, 5 things I hate/ don’t want to write about that would be great. I’d pick for love; Family, Cats, Crafting, good food, am at home all the time (disabled, be good to add that in so tailored, never going off for a long walk) then dislike/don’t want to write about would be music, outdoors, travelling, socialist with friends and sports - as these are all things I am not able to do or really dislike It needs a lot of work, it is no Zinnia for sure but it’s free and new and will grow I hope in time. I’m liking it for is writing out thoughts but you can’t search so I am then ScreenShotting and printing text for my “written” journal or Adding into zinnia as a snapshot What it does have so far is srautuf as Apple always is but it needs more “oomph” and to be an actual journaling app. It needs to be more in line with the newer version of pages, reminders and notes which have really changed to excellent Thank you Apple but it’s not quite there yet",,,,,,,,,2024-02-13T06:22:38,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10838655958,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/242645325?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=242645325

2024-01-18T15:52:04,6447391597,Journal,gb,en,1.1,Mahonimation,2,It has the potential but it’s far too simple at the moment.,"It’s fantastic having a Journal app preloaded on an iPhone. The app has so much potential! Just not yet… at the moment, it’s far too simple and really only offers you to make a journal entry, and that’s it. it does recommend what you can do in your journal, such as reflecting on your day a workout you might have logged on Strava and perhaps some photos you’ve taken a day. 

I believe the real strength with the journal app is to possibly combine the mental health app where you can record the state of your mental health from very unpleasant to very pleasant in journal entries. For me, that’s a great way to visually see my mood and what I did that day and see common patterns to help how I can improve in the future.

Another great feature would be to add tags, I’m categories. this is so you can search back through your journal entries for certain life events or anything specific that happened.

I honestly don’t think it’s a bad app, it’s just not quite complete yet… hence the two star review for now. As it involves I will happily change my review. I possibly think it was released a little bit too soon and too simplistic. The mindfulness part of Apple health is truly amazing. If the Journal app can be bought up to that standard and perhaps even combined, then that will be truly a game changer for Journal apps.",,,,,,,,,2024-02-13T06:22:38,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10836216041,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/242645330?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=242645330

It takes a bit of time for the text to start appearing on the screen after I type it. In addition, once you get to a certain part of the page, the keyboard ends up blocking the text so I can’t see it and I am not allowed scroll up.

I also believe be in-text images should be allowed rather than them only appearing on the summary of photos.

Other than that, great app! The suggestions are amazing, the reflection ideas are very interesting and diversified and the design of the app is overall amazing.

I didn’t like using Notes for that, I do like this. But it’s lacking a few things:

1. Timestamps. It adds the date to an entry but not the time. It’s odd that such a basic thing was overlooked.

2. Journalling is a mindfulness activity, yet this can’t be linked to Apple Health. Really? Isn’t this an app created by Apple?

3. No iPad version? Come on now!

4. Being able to create more than one journal.
 
5. Hashtags. Easy to add but optional for people who want a minimalistic journal.

I thought I’d downloaded this and forgotten, but I learned from reading other reviews that this is a new built-in Apple app. I agree with others that there should have been some sort of notice. People are concerned about security. I think Apple is pretty good with security but I understand people’s concerns. No warning this was coming and no in-app menu/settings.

I am not sure about this one I do like the idea that it is official so the entries will always be safer. My only issue is that there is no search option or emoji option to pin to the entry, so you don’t know if they’re good entries or bad entries and to try and find a specific entry based off of a word or phrase would be nearly impossible without a search feature. I do hope that Apple implements this.

Edit: I have just noticed that as I am trying to transfer over my old entries from the Diary app that I use now that if I try and transfer more than one photo at a time it crashes the Journal app. 

Overall, this seems like a good beta for what will hopefully be a decent app, but at the moment there are lacking features.

There are time stamps for if you make more than one entry during the day. There is is search option.

I like the minimalist design but it went to far. The prompt suggestions are nice but when you want to journal with a specific song you are out of luck if it not one of the suggestions. You should give the user the ability to add specific songs or specify other workouts or locations etc.

In short, the prompt/suggestion should’ve replace the ability to customize your own journal entry.

I put a lot of time into an audio note and when I was finished, I loved that it was there. However, I didn’t see any way to export it to any other application or save it anywhere. It’s a safe and secure way to store your journal but there’s no way to export it or give anyone access. It’s a note for an ongoing idea but I have no way to tag it or export it. Share ability? What if I want to share this with my kids? Do I have to give them access to my full iPhone just to get it? I have no way of putting this in any other format? In my opinion journals are for future generations. Yeah, it’s nice to look back on your own history but I want it for my kids and one day grandkids, I’m not sure what the point is if I can’t export anything, I can’t customize it, and I can’t share it.

Focusing too much on pulling your data from pictures and not enough on what a Journalling app needs, this app is missing too many features to make it worthy of your time. 
You can’t add timestamps, so multiple entries in one day will be out of chronological order. 
You can’t format headings or paste images into specific sections of the entry, so at this point Notes as more functionality but you can’t customise the date on Notes. 
There’s no tagging feature. Maybe you could use hashtags but there’s no search feature anyway so, again, Notes is better. 
No templates option for recurring entry styles. 
No version available on iCloud so you can’t update it from any other device. 
It doesn’t even fully integrate with all the native iOS apps on your phone. I thought the wellbeing notes from the Health app might be something that I’d be able to pull through to Journal, but nope, it can’t do that either.

In those scenarios, it’s common to have new insights, new experiences, or new reflections, and it would be great to connect both, it’s different to just edit the old one. Also, journaling is about materializing, in some way, the abstraction of our minds, emotion, and thoughts. A lot of good ideas comes up when journaling.

New feature suggestions: 

- A search bar to search words or dates in the app. 

- Multiple journals (You could mirror the books app for this, and have the ability to make custom covers) 

- the ability to add more data to each post, or in all compression so that the pictures and videos we upload take up less space 

- the ability to add different kinds of bookmarks, similar to “Tags” on Mac 

- 🌺 the option to Link our “State of Mind” flower from the health app to our journaled days as an option in the corner of posts. Further enhancing Apples promotion of mental health and utilising the app as an “at a glance” mental health tracker. It would also allow us to see if our mental health and the content of the day correlate. 

- the ability to jump to the date of a post in the photos app

- the addition of custom font choices and backgrounds for the journal app. Especially if you allow multiple journals.

I love the features it offers, being able to see videos in the entry etc. I feel that I lacks some formatting options. If it provided a few text formatting features like the app Craft, I think this would be my favorite journaling app by far. SO CLOSE!

__________________________________________

I would say this had so much potential. The app is glitchy the more I use it. If I have a longer journal entry, it is hard to view the bottom of the entry because the keyboard covers it. 

Another glitch is that when I underline a word it will underline in black and not white like the colors of the  letters. 

Lastly, I find myself constantly wanted to format the text differently and have an easier way of adjusting the format rather than highlighting, tapping, choosing format, then choosing bold, italics etc. not to mention if I want bold underline I have to do it twice.

while editing an entry i had previously saved, i tried shaking my phone to undo (as this had previously worked on the app). seeing that it wouldn’t give me the undo option upon shaking, i closed the app without saving in hopes it would return to the last saved version of the entry (thus undoing the edits i had done and wanted to undo).

after that, i tried opening the app and it was blank for a long time. now it only shows “Journal” with the plus button and three lines at the top right, with no button working. i have offloaded the app, uninstalled the app, and restarted my phone. i went as far as uninstalling the app, restarting my phone, then reinstalling.

since it’s a new app, i’m hoping that a future app update or even ios update will fix the issue. i came to really enjoy using the app and i hate having to wait to use it without a clear reason. i also have no idea if my previous entries will even be saved. i hope they are, though i have a suspicion that the last entry i had edited is now corrupted, so if the journal app isn’t working, it might be due to the previous entries still existing within it.

Many of which happen via our Apple devices already. 

However, for it to truly be useful a number of basic things are missing, amongst others:
1. The ability to attach an unlimited amount of photos and videos
2. The ability to show Photos and videos on a map view like in the “photos” app to see where one was that day or week and click through it that way 
3. The ability to attach voice recordings from other apps, especially including from apples own “voice memos” app 
4. The ability to tag entries and organize them into folders etc
5. The ability to tag sections in entries with things like: ‘thought’, ‘todo’, ‘personal development thought’ etc so it becomes searchable and groupable 
6. The ability to have custom templates for journal entries 

Etc. 
Apple, please implement these, you are onto something great, but only if you make this a broad featured app rather than keeping it minimal and high level like you prefer keeping your apps.

2024-01-05T21:36:44,6447391597,Journal,us,en,1.1,madilynsierra,3,"Okay, Hoping for Improvement Through Updates","I think the interface is pretty enough, and straightforward enough. I don’t hate this app, but after hearing rumors that it was coming and anticipating this for months, and updating ALL of my devices to get it once I realized it had been launched, I’m disappointed overall. 

Firstly, this app is only available for iPhone. Neither my MacBook or my iPad have access to it despite running the most recent iPadOS and macOS. 

Next, this app also seems to have extremely limited function. I can’t edit the background color of each “page,” I can’t edit my font, I can’t edit the font size, spacing, or color. I pasted some “entries” in from my Notes app, and they have a totally different line spacing than entries typed within the Journal, with no option to edit the spacing to make them consistent. I tried to insert a photo in-line, and discovered that isn’t an option. It placed my photo at the top of the entry, and the only option available was to remove the photo. If there are more options for photos, I can’t see them, because every time I click the photo inside the editor the entire app freezes. 

I had never tried the Freeform app before, because I don’t like the idea of a massive board with no set page size, but my disappointment in this app led me to try that, and I was blown away by the difference. 

If we could have customizable pages in the Journal app with similar functionality, this would be a huge hit. I loved that in Freeform, I could customize my font, font size, and font color, and move things around the page. I think the Journal app is majorly missing out by not including stickers, and I was glad to see that Freeform includes them. A function I would love to see brought into both is the ability to rotate text, photos, and stickers. 

Bottom line, would love to see this Journal app include a lot more customization going forward. I like the customizability in Freeform, but I think a “book” or “page” layout for journaling would be ideal - not a huge board with unlimited size and funky zooming. I would love to see this app become a hybrid of what it is now, with certain customization elements brought in from Freeform. 

I love what Apple has done as far as creating a portfolio of their own apps (Photos, Health, Freeform, Books, etc.) so I can sync across devices seamlessly and enjoy the clean, intuitive interfaces Apple is known for. For that reason, I don’t want to branch out into other journaling apps (if you are interested - I’ve heard great things about Day One). 

For now, I think I’ll use this for text-only writing, and start using Freeform for photos, stickers, and as a more creative outlet overall, but one day I hope to be able to keep all my journaling here, instead of split between two apps, and keep Freeform’s use more towards its intended Productivity purposes.",,,,,,,,,2024-01-18T10:15:18,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10788382740,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/237144604?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=237144604

Needless to say I am disappointed. Hundreds of journalling apps out there not just on iOS and I would rather stick to my physical journal or even the notes app as these journalling apps do not tie into or serve any meaningful value that a physical journal or the notes app doesn’t already serve. My thoughts were to be able to track my mental health like I can my other health stats with great detail, purpose, and ease of use. Having to do manual input in multiple locations (journal app, health app, and a physical media) for no added benefit means I am out. It’s not for me and due the lack of intended features I expected and the ability to easily log through other more convenient tools I rate this poorly.

If you want to add a photo, you have no option of where it goes. It automatically goes to the top of the entry. This is VERY annoying. What if I’m referencing several memories and how they made me feel but all of the photos are organized at the very top? I guess I can say “in reference to the six picture at the top, blahblahblah.” However, that is annoying. 

In an actual journal you can write (in cursive or print or however) and tape Polaroids in the location you desire and add doodles, write/draw in different colors. You have the creative freedom to express your feelings and desires however you like and however you aesthetically please. 

You cannot do much on this app. You can make your text bold or italicized. At this point the notes app on iPhone offers more than this app. With notes, you can add shapes, draw in different colors and thicknesses, add lists or tables, and add photos wherever you want them to be. 

Another annoying aspect, which I’m sure is something within the coding and with new apps there will always need to be adjustments, I get that. So, I wanted to bring attention to how annoying it is to type. Say you made an error a previous paragraph, you try to click in that area and it always brings me right to the bottom of the entry. Then, if I want to start a new paragraph, it bounces back up a paragraph and I can’t even see what I’m writing. Lastly, the current line of text being written is so close to the bar with the photo, camera, and suggestions. The cursor is literally cut off. Which makes it annoying to click anywhere within that line.

- adding a search feature to easily retrieve past entries. More filter & sort options for easier accessibility & organization 
- being able to add music or podcasts we listened to on the entry date, or people we spoke to via phone or FT 
- customizing each entry by being able to change the font, text size, highlight or underline words, text color, etc. 
- being able to add stickers 
- landscape vs portrait mode entries

Also, when I add photos in, I like that they are at the top, so they are viewable when you’re scrolling through us a list of your journal entries, I wish I could change what is shown in the preview for the photo. I also wish I had options for the layout of the photos when you add multiple.

-Have the option of locking your entries. If people got into my journal app, they could read everything I’ve written.

The app is not reliable at all and full of bugs after I type like a paragraph it gets deleted ( disappear ). On many days it doesn’t send recommendations or the places I visited or the steps. I am migrating to notes again for now. 

I’m genuinely excited about Apple’s new ‘Journal’ app, as it aligns well with my previous habit of journaling in the ‘Notes’ app. It’s great how Apple consistently prioritizes mental health, evident in their Health app. However, I find that ‘Journal’ falls short in terms of basic functionalities. For instance, it lacks essential features like search and sort capabilities, an intuitive way to add photos (preferably beneath text not similar to email attachments), tagging options, and more versatile sharing capabilities. Presently, sharing an entry inside the app leads to the creation of a new entry, even if it’s for the same day, which can be confusing. Additionally, I see a missed opportunity here. Integrating these journaling features into the existing ‘Notes’ app could enhance its utility. Imagine a dedicated ‘Journal’ category within ‘Notes,’ combining the best of both apps - suggestions, location tagging, voice recording from ‘Journal’, along with ‘Notes’’ robust text features. Also, I was hoping for integration with Apple’s Fitness and Health apps, which would have been immensely useful for my lifestyle. This integration could provide a more holistic approach to health and wellbeing tracking. In summary, while the ‘Journal’ app is a step in the right direction, it would benefit significantly from expanded features and integrations, enhancing its utility and user experience.",,,,,,,,,2023-12-26T06:03:51,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10736725503,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/232897115?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=232897115

There’s also a weird bug with the entry date. If I set it and change any media or write any text, it reverts back to today’s date. Please fix!

I like how easy it is, and how clean the interface is. I wish there was grouping by month. I wish I could tag contacts from my phone so my entries could be connected to people and I could see that in the contacts app.

I deal with BD and BDP so I wish there was an OPTIONAL feature for moods, or perception of self, perception of relationships, and symptoms experienced (typable).

I am an ambassador of wellbeing and journaling and find this AMAZING!!! Thank you so much! Used DayOne for YEARS for journaling before this app came out. 

But now when I tried it I’m not very happy with it’s functioning right now and I really hope you’ll improve it please 🙏🏻  it’s about the following points:
- VERY difficult to find how can I can change the texto format: add fat text, highlight it etc… and those who journal NEED IT!
- as far as I’ve seen, there is NO possibility to shange the size of the text. Even no a possibility to have a good big nice title! You should add many ones! Please 
- no possibility to add bullet points or numbered text automatically
- app bugs for me (iPhone 12)
- no possibility to have several journals on different topics
- no possibility to change icon (this one is terrible, sorry)
- don’t see entries per month
- no message to ensure me that my journal is safe here so I’m even afraid to share everything to be honest even if I know that it’s connected to other my iCloud etc
- difficult to read what I’ve shared

You’ve got work, but there is so much potential! Please add these things 🙏🏻 they are KEY!

It misses some features though. For me, mainly the possibility to make several journals, to sort the entries separately, is missing. That way you can start a new journal, end one, dedicate one to a particular subject or more rarely recurring event—centering a theme around it. You could potentially have a “view all entries” to get a continuity and totality feeling, so that it is bound by you personally. But if it allows that customization, there’s more expressive and creative capabilities. 

I also think its text should be readily exportable, so that there’s no hassle in copy-pasting, if we were to use it somewhere else. Because I like this app for its convenience: immediate sorting and a simplified interface. It forces you to write (mostly) one thing at a time, while you can also reference a voice memo or other files that went along with an event, conversation, or thought trail. A totally new way of journaling, on the whole.",,,,,,,,,2023-12-22T06:10:32,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10722063012,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/233381717?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=233381717

I’ve been getting more and more into Men’s Mental Health by Better understanding my Own. Just a day earlier I was thinking about this because I’ve been thinking about Apple coming out with their OWN app so I can stop using the NOTES app. There’s a few features that would blow my mind with this app. (I’m on the IPhone 14 Pro Max) 1. The APPLE PENCIL being compatible or a Fancy APPLE Stylus for IPhone that Allows handwritten Journal entries or drawings/sketches. I’d love to be able to pop out my APPLE Stylus and have some fancy options to really personalize my Journal. 2. Allow for Portrait Mode. I’d really like to be able to type (like at a keyboard on a desk) and have that feeling like I’m an author of my own story. OR Simply being able to rotate it and (With Apple Pencil) write like I would a piece of paper or being able to sign something at the bottom of my entry. Or maybe a side note written on my entry sideways. It’s just the Collaging/Journaling Experience for people to be able to express themselves without the Need for Social Media and others. Even A place to Open up about Very personal and Memorable Life Moments. The integration of the Apple Pencil or an Apple Branded Stylus for IPhone would Allow me to have a Cross Feeling of a PDA & a Physical Notebook 📓 in the palm of my hands. EDIT: Also Add the time of entry next to the date. Sometimes I want to put multiple like “note entries” throughout the day, sometimes something comes to my mind and I just want to talk(write) about it but it may not have anything to do with an earlier entry.",,,,,,,,,2023-12-21T03:37:28,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10718322960,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/232867939?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=232867939

One thing that’s bothering me though is the option to edit a title on an existing entry doesn’t seem to be available, at least not in an obvious way that I can find and I’m fairly tech savvy. You can create a title (or edit the existing premade one) on the new entry screen that lets you select the preexisting suggestions, but after the fact, there’s no title modification that I can find. I can just type something, but it doesn’t make it bold like the ones I’ve made in the moment. My OCD is irked by this a bit.

Also, PLEASE bring this app to iPad and Mac! I would love sitting down at my Mac at the end of the day to type these entries on a real keyboard instead of the virtual one on my iPhone. I’m sure the Suggestions API may need some translation to these other platforms, but the Mac can already see iPhone widgets, so just copy and paste the existing iPhone Suggestions over please!",,,,,,,,,2023-12-21T03:37:28,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10718087031,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/233076856?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=233076856

I suggest, to any user, to try taking more pictures when going out, then the journal app will suggest you to talk about the pictures — it is the most fun feature of the app, genuinely. I was grocery shopping and took a random picture for a friend of mine, then the journal app suggested me to comment on it and it made my day so much better. But the feature that creates a completely unique feeling to the app is / are the reflection tabs. You can sit anywhere, at the bus station, at a cafe, at your desk and can benefit from this feature almost instantaneously. You press a button to refresh, you select and it’s almost as if you’re instantly mindful about you, your thoughts and your surroundings — imagine syncing this with your health app! About being in sync with other apps, maybe we’ll see connectivity with our screen time stats, health trends, taking a walk out of our homes, fitness trends, changes in our BPM, our delayed reminders — this might become a life-changing app for lots of users in the future updates. It might ask you questions such as “We’ve been noticing a significant increase in your BPM and we just wanted to know if you have been stressed lately? If yes, why?”. Back to the notes app! The notes app has some features that would benefit this app too, such as text formatting, collaborative pages, a wide-ranged search function. As a person who reuses his stashed thoughts for conversations, podcasts and essays, not having a search function is a major factor downside. Thus far, the notes app is present on all devices and we have no fear of it being discontinued. With the help of other functions such as drawing, tables and doc scanning, the notes app can work a powerhouse of systematized thinking. So, at this very moment, there isn’t much reason to switch your journaling from notes to this app. So, let’s connect the journal app with books, with health and with whatever Apple might consider. Let’s connect a person with its good habits and empowering ideas or practices. It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s simple and it clears your mind with ease. Let’s see what Apple’s got ready for us!",,,,,,,,,2023-12-21T06:15:00,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10717249339,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/233096172?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=233096172

Firstly, I expected from Apple a cleaner and more minimalist interface, similar to a real diary page (I recall trying a similar app which, in my opinion, is currently the best in the store). Additionally, I would like the app to offer the ability to add moods, meditation exercises, and various quotes (something in the style of Stoic, for instance).

Finally, I'm not sure if it's just a problem on my end, but after setting the song to play automatically, I can't manually select it.

 This app was one of the biggest releases of 17.2 and it was significantly overhyped. _ _ _  Apple has never been strong on the software and they proved it yet again with a substandard app. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _  _ _  _  Here are just a couple of the bigger misses. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _  1. No integration with shortcuts is a joke. (P.S. Notes has shortcut integration) _ _ _ _ _ _  The real value of a digital journal is it doing a chunk of the work for you. And these suggestions are a weak replacement. _ _ _ _ _  _  Take a note from Day One, include it all, or at least give me the ability to do it via Shortcuts. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  2. The audio notes should do the audio recording and transcript at the same time. _ _ _ _ _  _  Everything is easier said that written, there is so much emotion in verbal language.   _ _ _ _ _  _  Having said that audio is not nearly as searchable. Having both is a must for a great journaling app.

2023-12-15T16:53:35,6447391597,Journal,in,en,1.1,Sam_bucks,4,My honest review of Apple’s Journal app: The pros and cons,"I have been using Apple’s new Journal app for a few weeks now, and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I like the simplicity and privacy of the app, which offers prompts and suggestions based on my photos, locations, and activities to help me journal my daily entries. On the other hand, I feel that the app lacks some features and polish that would make it more enjoyable and useful.
• First of all, the app needs some improvement in UI design. The app is mostly a white screen with a “+” button, which looks bland and boring. The suggestions are often repetitive or irrelevant, and there is no way to customize them or filter them by category.
• Secondly, the app needs more features to make it more versatile and fun. For example, I would like to see more options for formatting, such as fonts, colors, or bullet points. The app also does not have any social or sharing features, which would be nice for those who want to share their journals with friends or family.
• Thirdly, the app needs a calendar view to make it easier to navigate and review my entries. Right now, the app only shows a list of entries sorted by date, which is not very convenient or intuitive. A calendar view would allow me to see my entries at a glance, jump to a specific date, or compare different periods of time.
In conclusion, Apple’s Journal app is a simple and smart companion for your memories, but it has a lot of room for improvement. I hope that Apple will listen to the feedback from the users and add more features and polish to the app in the future. I would rate the app 4 out of 5 stars.",,,,,,,,,2023-12-17T06:13:08,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10697639192,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/232648882?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=232648882

I don’t like that it is hindered by photos being kept at the top of the entry. The idea of a journal is a place to enter data in a free form way that reflects the owner. This app is very restrictive. It would’ve been nice if the developers would’ve taken the flexibility of notes and integrated that into journal more than attaching AI to a lesser version of notes. 
Here are a couple of suggestions that would improve this for me: 
-Able to place content in any order.
-When entering text, pressing enter twice will not jump the view to the top.
-Able to layer items and have a pop out layer control menu.

I think it is essential for this app to be added to the iPad as soon as possible so please get working on it, team!

I love everything apple is doing so far but I noticed the app is not available on iPad. a lot of people would use the journal app if it was more accessible. If there is anyway possible to get something like journal for iPad I would deeply appreciate it. I love the concept but not being able to use such a powerful app like that on the iPad Pro 12.9 m2 makes me a little frustrated. I know I have a beast of a machine. But why can't I use it for the one app that I want to use so badly when people were talking about the concept. All l'm asking is please. Do your best to get notes to work on the iPad pro 12.9 I can give you honest feedback on your apps and your devices. The app looks like it can go a long way.

The current + button is not the most frequently used action but it stands in the way of main contents. It steals the  main focus from the main content.  Users view/edit journal more than adding.

It is inconsistent with all other existing apps like Message, Notes, Mails, etc., which keep add/new/compose button on the navigation bar. It looks like Apple is trying to rush an app out with compromised design that it tries to bright developers working for A…d app to write this one.

Another thing not related to FAB. It is so inconvenient to tap the journal item and choose edit/bookmark action. This is so bad for user to tap many times for a frequent operation. 

Overall this app is poorly designed. Why not just merge some new features into the note app? 

The reason I write such a long and critical comment Is to discourage the poor design style by a builtin app that might be followed by more and more third party apps, which would finally ruin the iOS ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,2023-12-16T06:15:56,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10688821092,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/232541520?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=232541520

I was hoping for so much more in an Apple journal. Instead I got a 2009 droid journal. It’s like 2008 called and asked for the Shein copy of Evernote. 

This is just so boring. The Ui feels like it was thrown together. I keep getting g suggestions to journal about photos and screenshots from 2019. The prompts are lame.

This took month/years to develop? I meditated and used the Waking Up app thinking “maybe it’ll ask how the meditation went?” Nope. 

I was hoping there would be a screensaver widget from the Lock Screen. Nope.

It just feels like like it was a high school kids project. Maybe that’s what it is? Maybe someone at Apple said to their teenage kid “hey! You can either mow the lawn or make me a journaling app and I’ll let you borrow the car.” 

I was expecting more. 

I ended up downloading DayOne again. I wonder how much money Snapple made from DayOne subs after launching thjs? Very smart!!!

I bet every iPhone user is grateful for having it right now after a long wait. However there are some features and tweaks that if addressed soon in this app, it will be ever greater:

1. Adding Years and Months Headlines Section breaks—sort of, to group them in a neat way rather than having dozens of them collapsing that requires endless scrolling to reach intended time point (especially for those who writes on a daily basis or who will manually transfer their old journals from somewhere else)

2. Adding Search tool.

Then I couldn’t save the entry with the ‘Done’ button being greyed out and nothing I did could change it so the entry was wasted. I suspect something to do with the attachment limit but even removing some didn’t alllow me to save it.

You can add photos to your entries if you want and even lock the entire app behind a passcode or FaceID.

Some feedback on what I’d like to see:

What I would like to see is the journal app be more integrated with the Health app for mindful journaling instead of having to open the health app separate to input relevant data or data points users want to track.

I’d love it if I could also include how I am feeling in that moment in the journal entry and have that added to my overall health profile. This in turn could also help medical professionals diagnose and track behavioral health issues such as depression, anxiety, etc.

It would also be nice to see included with an entry the amount of sleep that has been obtained as this can dictate mood.

Meal tracking and caffeine tracking could also be included and really help those who want to mindfully journal track everything.",,,,,,,,,2023-12-01T03:33:20,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10639215695,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/231015645?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=231015645

Based on the way it was presented at the iOS 17 reveal, I thought that the Journal app would be at least *kind of* like that. But it’s not at all. Maybe it’s just because it’s a beta, but the recommendation feature seems to not work at all for me. It just recommends boilerplate writing prompts that I could get from any website. And as others have said, the app lacks any organizational features or text formatting. Crucially, it also seems to lack the ability to export my entries, which is about par for the course for Apple, but still a dealbreaker for an app like this.

Hopefully they’ll improve it over time, but right now this app is a huge missed opportunity.",,,,,,,,,2023-11-26T02:01:05,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10560602893,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/230074333?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=230074333

I expected each log to pull all sorts of data from your phone:

1. Places you’ve visited / travelled to
2. A snapshot of your calendar on that day
3. Exercises you’ve done
4. Your heart rate / other health data on that particular day
4. Key photos you took
5. The weather on that day

I was hoping to essentially be able to scroll back in time and revisit previous days of my life on top of writing daily journals.

Despite the above this app also lacks very basic features of any journal app:

1. Unable to search
2. No calendar view 
3. Unable to have multiple journals / categorise them
4. Unable to write your own prompts
5. No recently deleted / recovery
6. No templates
7. No text formatting / checklists

Some things simply don’t work:

1. My phone is not displaying any ‘suggested writing’ prompts

no search, 
no import/export of data,

I wouldn’t know how many consecutive days have I kept the journal, or what are the missing days. Nothing just a + button to add a new entry. Also inside the app, there are no formatting tools, no commands to add time or date stamps, create tags, etc. Perhaps it backs in iCloud as there are no options that too.

It’s missing some absolute basics like formatting of text for bullets and, most importantly, throwbacks. 

One of the most useful features of any journaling app is to be able to see previous posts from 30, 90, 1yr, 5yrs, etc. ago. 

Throwbacks help you see that most feelings are temporary and pass. To be reminded that a month ago you were in a real funk and now you feel great is a very powerful motivator for you next time you’re in a real funk. 

On the plus side, the provocations from the suggestions are quite good. Forcing you to reflect on something like a decision you’ve recently made that you’re proud of is not something I would do without provocation.

I’ve been anticipating this release since it was demonstrated at WWDC ‘23 since journaling is something I’ve always aspired to do throughout daily life, but I just never managed to hold onto. I feel this will be the key to that. Having a native App that has the potential to integrate with our other iOS features/services opens up an entirely new and immersive way to creatively express our daily selves for ourselves and for others. 

Journal is clean and simple thus far which keeps you focused on YOU when using it. The App allows you to attach photos to your entries as well as songs and location tags to further enhance and draw references to your experiences. It even allows verbal entries through the use of Voice Memos if typing isn’t ideal for you. The fact that it has built-in Face ID reminds you that security and privacy are still paramount in Apple’s design language for its native Apps. Truly a gift to one’s mind and routine. 🙂",,,,,,,,,2023-11-26T02:01:05,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10530436177,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/230074330?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=230074330

*The ability to insert images within the contents of an entry. It’s lovely that images act as covers for an entry, but that shouldn’t take away from the ability to place them within an entry. They can be two separate decisions.  
*The ability to set more than one daily reminder to journal. Helpful for people who, perhaps, journal in the morning and night, or do so at intermittent intervals of their day.

First, the app is super basic which I find insane since it took months or even years to develop. It’s basically a blank sheet with minimal options. 
There is no customization…at all. No fonts, markdown, formatting, nothing. It’s basically like the notes app but under a different name. 
There is no way to organize entries - folders, different journals, nothing. I will continue to give it some time but I can’t fathom this replacing any of the third party apps out there.

That being said, there is plenty of room for 3rd-party apps to build on this with more advanced options like templates and tags for those who need more. 

This app will serve the journaling needs of 90% of users but Apple’s allowing other apps to use an API in their own, more advanced journaling apps to get access to similar journaling suggestion. Apple seems to be positioning themselves as a gateway app for more advanced journaling apps if you need them. 

There are a few features that can be added here and there, like folders, but otherwise it’s a great start and we are still early in the app’s evolution. I look forward to seeing how it develops over the years and expands to other parts of the Apple ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,2023-11-26T02:01:05,,,,,0,0,https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/ra/ng/app/6447391597/ios/ratingsResponses?reviewId=10520688620,https://appfollow.io/app/67463/review/230074329?s=global5,https://watch.appfollow.io/apps/worldwide/reviews/552140?review_id=230074329
